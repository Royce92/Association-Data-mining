 unified national smart grid is a proposal for a united states wide area grid that is a national interconnected network relying on a high capacity backbone of electric power transmission lines linking all the nation s local electrical networks that have been upgraded to smart grids  europe s analogous project is sometimes referred to as the supersmart grid  a term that also appears in the literature describing the unified smart grid      president barack obama asked the united states congress  to act without delay  to pass legislation that included doubling renewable energy production in the next three years and building a new electricity  smart grid               high capacity transmission such as current technology    kv high voltage direct current lines would span the country providing linkages to local electric utilities and distantly located bulk power generation facilities  the national backbone would be intelligent in a manner similar to local smart grid clusters  as local electricity networks are upgraded to smart grids  interactions with the national backbone can become more coordinated  examples given of the kinds of coordination are that hydropower from the northwest can be dispatched if wind is expected to temporarily subside in the dakotas  discretionary air conditioning in california can be turned on if there are strong winds blowing in delaware     long distance interconnections are not new  the      kilometer pacific dc intertie between los angeles and the pacific northwest was proposed in the     s and initiated by president john f  kennedy in the   s  the pacific intertie carries up to     gigawatts on two     kv overhead lines  the      kilometer quebec to new england hvdc line with   gigawatts of capacity was constructed in the     s  a   gigawatt    kv system is being constructed along the southern provinces of china at a cost of      million and is scheduled for completion in          the unified smart grid proposal is not simply a collection of point to point interconnections between regional systems with some communications intelligence  the topology conceptually has many access points with each node being a smart grid that could be a virtual power generation cluster  could be a local electric utility system  or could be a grid energy storage facility     according to advocates  the idea of a national system would do for the us energy economy what dwight eisenhower s interstate highway system did for efficient distribution of products  solar power from arizona would be able to supply manufacturing in ohio  or evening wind power from the northeast could be used to supply power peak demand during the day in nevada  according to leading scientists such as james e  hansen  construction of such a national grid is essential to any strategy to combat global warming   according to energy independence advocates such as t  boone pickens  it is essential for the u s  economy and its strategic energy interests  some advocate the system as a candidate for a massive public works project that would stimulate the us economy after the global financial crisis of           the  unified smart grid  is promoted by alliance for climate protection  repower america program   and al gore  the cost estimate by al gore is      billion  and would be recovered by tariffs on transmission  the need for a national bulk transmission grid is detailed in t  boone pickens s energy independence plan citation needed
