 the user interface  in the industrial design field of human machine interaction  is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur  the goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end  whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators decision making process  examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems  hand tools  heavy machinery operator controls  and process controls  the design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology     generally  the goal of user interface design is to produce a user interface which makes it easy  self explanatory   efficient  and enjoyable  user friendly  to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result  this generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output  and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human     with the increased use of personal computers and the relative decline in societal awareness of heavy machinery  the term user interface is generally assumed to mean the graphical user interface  while industrial control panel and machinery control design discussions more commonly refer to human machine interfaces     other terms for user interface include human computer interface and man machine interface  mmi              the user interface or human machine interface is the part of the machine that handles the human machine interaction  membrane switches  rubber keypads and touchscreens are examples of the physical part of the human machine interface which we can see and touch     in complex systems  the human machine interface is typically computerized  the term human computer interface refers to this kind of system  in the context of computing the term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for human computer interaction     the engineering of the human machine interfaces is enhanced by considering ergonomics  human factors   the corresponding disciplines are human factors engineering  hfe  and usability engineering  ue   which is part of systems engineering     tools used for incorporating human factors in the interface design are developed based on knowledge of computer science  such as computer graphics  operating systems  programming languages  nowadays  we use the expression graphical user interface for human machine interface on computers  as nearly all of them are now using graphics     there is a difference between a user interface and an operator interface or a human machine interface  hmi      in science fiction  hmi is sometimes used to refer to what is better described as direct neural interface  however  this latter usage is seeing increasing application in the real life use of  medical  prostheses the artificial extension that replaces a missing body part  e g   cochlear implants        in some circumstance computers might observe the user  and react according to their actions without specific commands  a means of tracking parts of the body is required  and sensors noting the position of the head  direction of gaze and so on have been used experimentally  this is particularly relevant to immersive interfaces       the history of user interfaces can be divided into the following phases according to the dominant type of user interface     in the batch era  computing power was extremely scarce and expensive  user interfaces were rudimentary  users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around  user interfaces were considered overhead  and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible     the input side of the user interfaces for batch machines were mainly punched cards or equivalent media like paper tape  the output side added line printers to these media  with the limited exception of the system operator s console  human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all     submitting a job to a batch machine involved  first  preparing a deck of punched cards describing a program and a dataset  punching the program cards wasn t done on the computer itself  but on specialized typewriter like machines that were notoriously balky  unforgiving  and prone to mechanical failure  the software interface was similarly unforgiving  with very strict syntaxes meant to be parsed by the smallest possible compilers and interpreters     once the cards were punched  one would drop them in a job queue and wait  eventually  operators would feed the deck to the computer  perhaps mounting magnetic tapes to supply another dataset or helper software  the job would generate a printout  containing final results or  all too often  an abort notice with an attached error log  successful runs might also write a result on magnetic tape or generate some data cards to be used in later computation     the turnaround time for a single job often spanned entire days  if one were very lucky  it might be hours  real time response was unheard of  but there were worse fates than the card queue  some computers actually required an even more tedious and error prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches  the very earliest machines actually had to be partly rewired to incorporated program logic into themselves  using devices known as plugboards     early batch systems gave the currently running job the entire computer  program decks and tapes had to include what we would now think of as operating system code to talk to i o devices and do whatever other housekeeping was needed  midway through the batch period  after       various groups began to experiment with so called  load and go  systems  these used a monitor program which was always resident on the computer  programs could call the monitor for services  another function of the monitor was to do better error checking on submitted jobs  catching errors earlier and more intelligently and generating more useful feedback to the users  thus  monitors represented a first step towards both operating systems and explicitly designed user interfaces     command line interfaces  clis  evolved from batch monitors connected to the system console  their interaction model was a series of request response transactions  with requests expressed as textual commands in a specialized vocabulary  latency was far lower than for batch systems  dropping from days or hours to seconds  accordingly  command line systems allowed the user to change his or her mind about later stages of the transaction in response to real time or near real time feedback on earlier results  software could be exploratory and interactive in ways not possible before  but these interfaces still placed a relatively heavy mnemonic load on the user  requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master      the earliest command line systems combined teleprinters with computers  adapting a mature technology that had proven effective for mediating the transfer of information over wires between human beings  teleprinters had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception  they had a history going back to      and had already become well established in newsrooms and elsewhere by       in reusing them  economy was certainly a consideration  but psychology and the rule of least surprise mattered as well  teleprinters provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users     the widespread adoption of video display terminals  vdts  in the mid     s ushered in the second phase of command line systems  these cut latency further  because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move  they helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture  and were to the first tv generation of the late     s and   s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the     s     just as importantly  the existence of an accessible screen   a two dimensional display of text that could be rapidly and reversibly modified   made it economical for software designers to deploy interfaces that could be described as visual rather than textual  the pioneering applications of this kind were computer games and text editors  close descendants of some of the earliest specimens  such as rogue     and vi     are still a live part of unix tradition     in       with the beginning of windows and other gui  ibm created what is called the standard application architecture standard which include the c u a   common user access  derivative  c u a  successfully created what we know and use today in windows  and most of the more recent dos or windows console applications will use that standard as well     this defined that a pulldown menu system should be at the top of the screen  status bar at the bottom  shortcut keys should stay the same for all common functionality  f  to open for example would work in all applications that followed the s a a  standard   this greatly helped the speed at which users could learn an application so it caught on quick and became an industry standard      primary methods used in the interface design include prototyping and simulation     typical human machine interface design consists of the following stages  interaction specification  interface software specification and prototyping     all great interfaces share eight qualities or characteristics     the principle of least astonishment  pola  is a general principle in the design of all kinds of interfaces  it is based on the idea that human beings can only pay full attention to one thing at one time    leading to the conclusion that novelty should be minimized     historic hmi in the driver
