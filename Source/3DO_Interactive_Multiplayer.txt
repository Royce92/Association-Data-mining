 the  do interactive multiplayer  often called simply the  do  is a home video game console platform developed by the  do company  conceived by entrepreneur and electronic arts founder trip hawkins  the  do was not a console manufactured by the company itself  but a series of specifications  originally designed by dave needle and r  j  mical of new technologies group  that could be licensed by third parties  panasonic produced the first models in       and further renditions of the hardware were released in      by sanyo and goldstar  now lg corp      despite a highly promoted launch  including being named time magazine s       product of the year   and a host of cutting edge technologies  the  do s high price and an oversaturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to veteran competitors sega and nintendo     since its discontinuation in late       the  do has been frequently derided by video game historians                the  do interactive multiplayer was originally conceived by the  do company  founded in      by electronic arts founder trip hawkins  the company s objective was to create a next generation  cd based video game entertainment standard which would be manufactured by various partners and licensees   do would collect a royalty on each console sold and on each game manufactured  to game publishers  the low    royalty rate per game was a better deal than the higher royalties paid to nintendo and sega when making games for their consoles  the  do hardware itself was designed by dave needle and r j  mical  starting from an outline on a restaurant napkin in        trip hawkins recalled     i d actually known those guys for a while and we are kindred spirits     and it turned out that they had already started working on designing a next generation system and they had made some very important decisions that were the same decisions that i would have made  architecture and approach   rather than me start a brand new team and starting from scratch it just made a lot of sense to     join forces with them and shape what they were doing into what i wanted it to be      the  do company lacked the resources to manufacture consoles themselves  and instead licensed the hardware to other companies for manufacturing  trip hawkins recounted that they approached every electronics manufacturer  but that their chief targets were sony and panasonic  the two largest consumer electronics companies in the world   however  sony had already begun development on their own console  the playstation  and ultimately decided to continue work on it rather than sign with  do   panasonic launched the  do with its fz   model in       though goldstar and sanyo would later manufacture the  do as well  companies who obtained the hardware license but never actually sold  do units include samsung   toshiba   and at t  who went so far as to build prototype at t  do units and display them at the january      consumer electronics show      licensing to independent manufacturers made the system extremely expensive  the manufacturers had to make a profit on the hardware itself  whereas most major game console manufacturers  such as sega and sony  sold their systems at a loss  with expectations of making up for the loss with software sales  some sources claim that  do was priced at          far above competing game systems and aimed at high end users and early adopters  hawkins has argued that  do was launched at       and not  higher myths that are often reported     in a later interview  hawkins clarified that while the suggested retail price was       few retailers sold the system at that price   goldstar  sanyo  and panasonic s later models were less expensive to manufacture than the fz   and were sold for considerably lower prices  for example  the goldstar model launched at        in addition  after six months on the market  the price of the fz   had dropped to           leading some to contend that the  do s cost was not as big a factor in its market failure as is usually claimed      the launch of the platform in october      received a great deal of attention in the press as part of the  multimedia wave  in the computer world at the time  return fire  road rash  fifa international soccer  and jurassic park interactive had been slated for launch releases but were pushed to mid      due to the developers  struggles with the then cutting edge hardware   moreover  the  do company made continued updates to the console hardware almost up to the system s release  which resulted in a number of third party titles missing the launch date  in some cases by less than a month  because the developers weren t left enough time to fully test them on the finalized hardware    the only  do software available at launch was the third party game crash  n burn       the system was released in japan in march      with an initial lineup of six games  the japanese launch was moderately successful  with        units shipping to        stores   however  sales soon dropped and by      the system was known in japan as a host for pornographic releases       price drops announced in february      were perceived in the industry to be an effort to improve market penetration before the release of the promised successor to  do  the m   heavy promotional efforts on the ytv variety show it s alive and a stream of hinted product expandability supported that idea citation needed to assure consumers that the  do would still be supported  the m  was initially announced as an add on for the  do    it was later revealed that the m  would be an entirely separate console  albeit one with  do backward compatibility  eventually  however  the m  project was scrapped altogether     the  do system was eventually discontinued at the end of      with a complete shutdown of all internal hardware development and divestment of the m  technology   do restructured themselves around this same time  repositioning their internal software development house as a multi platform company supporting the playstation  sega saturn  and computer platforms     the higher quality of later cd rom based systems that emerged in the mid   s citation needed the uneven quality of the games  and the initial high price point are all considered to be among the many issues that led to the  do s demise      due to the licensing method employed by  do a number of different manufacturers produced the  do system for the market  the panasonic versions are the best known and most common     the original edition of the console  the fz    was referred to in full as the  do real interactive multiplayer  the console had advanced hardware features at the time  an arm      bit risc cpu  two custom video coprocessors  a custom    bit dsp and a custom math co processor  it also featured  xa megabytes  mb  of dram   xa mb of vram  and a double speed cd rom drive for main cd gs or photo cds  and video cds with an add on mpeg video module    the  do included the first light synthesizer in a game console  converting cd music to a mesmerizing color pattern     the  do is one of few cd based units that feature neither regional lockout nor copy protection  making it easy to use pirated software    although there is no regional lockout present in any  do machine  a few japanese games cannot be played on non japanese  do consoles due to a special kanji font which english language consoles could not read  games that have compatibility issues include sword and sorcery  which was released in english under the title lucienne s quest   the adult video game twinkle knights and a demo version of alone in the dark     processor    display    system board    sound    media    all  do consoles have integrated power supplies  some models  panasonic  do fz    sanyo try  do  and goldstar  do  have hardwired power cords  others  panasonic  do fz     use an iec c p  figure    power cord  all north american model specifications are ac    v   xa hz   w     among the accessories shipped standard with most  do systems were a v and power cables along with one standard controller  the  do controllers were unique in that the system base unit contained only one controller port and the controllers could be physically daisy chained together via a port on the back of each controller  up to eight controllers could be linked together in this fashion  all controllers for each  do console are compatible with one another     in addition  standard  do controllers released with the panasonic fz   also contained a headphone jack and volume control for silent play  the goldstar  lg  model also included a controller with this feature     third party controllers were produced by a number of companies including logitech  world international trading corporation also released an adapter that allows super nes controllers to be used with the  do       the only light gun ever released for the  do was the gamegun  a product of third party developer american laser games  despite this  no fewer than    games with light gun support were produced for the system  most of these were arcade ports from american laser games  including the infamous mad dog mccree   but virgin interactive and digital pictures also released  do light gun games  the  do gamegun uses the same design as the gamegun released for the sega cd  an orange  old west  revolver  select gameguns house a controller port so that another gamegun may be daisy chained for two player gaming  which is supported in most of american laser games s  do titles  though no light gun was released for the  do in japan  the japanese localizations of demolition man and corpse killer retain light gun support  and could be played by japanese gamers using imported gameguns     panasonic and logitech both released the  do mouse  the panasonic fz jm  and logitech  do mouse are identical aside from their markings  fewer than    games supported its use  some of which were optimized for the standard controller or light gun rather than the mouse  of the  do games which were optimized for use with the mouse  the most well known are myst and lemmings  the panasonic mouse was also bundled with konami s policenauts limited edition in japan which came with a policenauts mouse pad       home arcade systems released a steering wheel for the  do which is supported by several racing titles  including the need for speed     the panasonic fz em    is a    xa kb expandable memory unit that plugs into the  do expansion bay on the back of the console  released in      and sold in japan only  but is compatible with all models  it came with a storage manager start up disc that is required to use the unit       the panasonic  do karaoke mixer allows  do owners to play a standard music cd  turn the vocals down  plug in one or two microphones and sing over the music  this unit was not released in all markets       some of the best received titles were ports of arcade or pc games that other cartridge based systems of the time were not capable of playing  such as alone in the dark  myst and star control ii  other popular titles included total eclipse  jurassic park interactive  gex  crash  n burn  slayer  killing time  the need for speed  road rash  and immercenary  the  do version of arcade title samurai shodown was the only port with faithful graphics for some time  and the  do super street fighter ii turbo was the first and arguably the best port with its cd quality audio     since its release coincided with the arrival of the modern first person shooter  the  do also had some of the earliest members of the genre as exclusives  such as escape from monster manor  the previously mentioned killing time  and po ed  as well as ports of wolfenstein  d and doom     however  the  do library also exhibited less successful aspects of home gaming at the time  it was launched at the dawn of cd rom gaming  and early titles on  do  and mega cd alike  frequently attempted to use interactive movie style gameplay  such titles rendered all or nearly all of their graphics in full motion video  which necessitated that any interactive influence from the player be limited to a greater extent than other games of the time  some games followed a single unfolding of events simply by correctly timed prompts executed by the player  night trap  mad dog mccree  and the daedalus encounter are some of the more notorious titles from this era  also  digital video was of very low quality at the time  especially on low cost consumer devices     due to the  do s struggles on the market  the game series the need for speed and gex were moved to more popular platforms like the playstation and windows  however  the  do hit return fire achieved only limited success with its rereleases     the  do company designed a next generation console that was never released due to various business and technological issues  the m  project  which began as an accelerator add on for the  do    was to use dual powerpc     processors in addition to newer  d and video rendering technologies  late during development  the company abandoned the console hardware business and sold the m  technology to matsushita  while matsushita initially claimed to be planning a game console with the technology  it was shortly thereafter re branded for the kiosk market competing with the cd i system     konami later made an m  based arcade board    games ran straight from the cd rom drive causing long load times and a high failure rate due to the cd rom being continuously in use     video game  primary market at launch     video game  primary market at end of life     high end a v  secondary market   multi purpose audio video systems     reviewing the  do just prior to its launch  gamepro gave it a  thumbs sideways   they commented that  the  do is the first cd rom system to make a real jump forward in graphics  sound  and game design   however  they questioned whether it would soon be rendered obsolete by the upcoming jaguar cd and  project reality   i e  the nintendo    note   and felt there were not yet enough games to justify a purchase  recommending that gamers wait several months to see if the system would get a worthwhile library of games    the  do was awarded worst console launch of      by electronic gaming monthly    in a special game machine cross review in may       famicom ts shin would score the  do real console a    out of          citing a lack of decent exclusives and an  astronomical asking price   in      video game website ign chose the  do as its   nd greatest video game console of all time  slightly higher than the atari jaguar but lower than its four other major competitors  the snes   th best   the sega genesis   th   the playstation   th   and the sega saturn    th    on yahoo  games the  do was placed among the top five worst console launches due to its one game launch lineup and high launch price   gaming retrospectives have also frequently accused the  do of having an abundance of poor quality interactive movies      trip hawkins  business model for selling  do was widely derided by industry figures        do is working on a  do emulator based on the freedo source code  most games are now playable with minor issues
