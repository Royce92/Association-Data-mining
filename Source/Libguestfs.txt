 libguestfs is a set of tools for accessing and modifying virtual disk images used in platform virtualization  the tools can be used for viewing and editing virtual machines managed by libvirt and files inside guests  scripting changes to vms  monitoring disk used free statistics  creating guests  p v  v v  performing partial backups  cloning vms  and much else besides      libguestfs can access nearly any type of file system including  all known types of linux filesystem  ext       xfs  btrfs  etc    any windows filesystem  vfat and ntfs   any mac os x and bsd filesystems  lvm  volume management  mbr and gpt disk partitions  raw disks  qcow   virtualbox vdi  vmware vmdk  hyper v vhd vhdx  on files  local devices  cd and dvd isos  sd cards  or remotely over ftp  http  ssh  iscsi  nbd  glusterfs  ceph  sheepdog  and much much more  libguestfs does not require root permissions     all this functionality is available through a convenient shell called guestfish  or use virt rescue to get a rescue shell for fixing unbootable virtual machines  multiple editing tools are available modeled after ordinary unix commands  such as virt cat and virt tar      libguestfs is also an api and its implementation as a library that can be linked with c and c   management programs and has bindings for perl  python  ruby  java  ocaml  php  haskell  erlang and lua and golang and c   you can also use it from shell scripts or the command line  using our fuse module you can also mount guest filesystems on the host       and    libguestfs is implemented using the kernel based virtual machine for the linux kernel
