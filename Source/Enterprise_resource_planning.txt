 enterprise resource planning  erp  is business management software usually a suite of integrated applications that a company can use to collect  store  manage and interpret data from many business activities  including     erp provides an integrated view of core business processes  often in real time  using common databases maintained by a database management system  erp systems track business resources cash  raw materials  production capacity and the status of business commitments  orders  purchase orders  and payroll  the applications that make up the system share data across the various departments  manufacturing  purchasing  sales  accounting  etc   that provide the data   erp facilitates information flow between all business functions  and manages connections to outside stakeholders      enterprise system software is a multi billion dollar industry that produces components that support a variety of business functions  it investments have become the largest category of capital expenditure in united states based businesses over the past decade  though early erp systems focused on large enterprises  smaller enterprises increasingly use erp systems      the erp system is considered a vital organizational tool because it integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error free transactions and production  however  erp system development is different from traditional systems development   erp systems run on a variety of computer hardware and network configurations  typically using a database as an information repository              in       gartner group first used the acronym erp  as an extension of material requirements planning  mrp   later manufacturing resource planning   and computer integrated manufacturing  without replacing these terms  erp came to represent a larger whole that reflects the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing      not all erp packages developed from a manufacturing core  erp vendors variously began with accounting  maintenance  and human resources  by the mid     s erp systems addressed all core enterprise functions  governments and non profit organizations also began to use erp systems       erp systems experienced rapid growth in the     s  but because the year      problem and introduction of the euro disrupted legacy systems  many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with erp       erp systems initially focused on automating back office functions that did not directly affect customers and the general public  front office functions  such as customer relationship management  crm   dealt directly with customers  or e business systems such as e commerce  e government  e telecom  and e finance or supplier relationship management  srm  became integrated later  when the internet simplified communicating with external parties citation needed     erp ii  was coined in      in an article by gartner publications entitled erp is dead   long live erp ii    it describes web based software that provides real time access to erp systems to employees and partners  such as suppliers and customers   the erp ii role expands traditional erp resource optimization and transaction processing  rather than just manage buying  selling  etc  erp ii leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises    erp ii is more flexible than the first generation erp  rather than confine erp system capabilities within the organization  it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems  enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems     developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the erp system  erp vendors are extending erp to these devices  along with other business applications  technical stakes of modern erp concern integration hardware  applications  networking  supply chains  erp now covers more functions and roles including decision making  stakeholders  relationships  standardization  transparency  globalization  etc       erp  enterprise resource planning  systems typically include the following characteristics     an erp system covers the following common functional areas  in many erp systems these are called and grouped together as erp modules     most erp systems incorporate best practices  this means the software reflects the vendor s interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process  systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices    companies that implemented industry best practices reduced time consuming project tasks such as configuration  documentation  testing  and training  in addition  best practices reduced risk by     compared to other software implementations       use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as ifrs  sarbanes oxley  or basel ii  they can also help comply with de facto industry standards  such as electronic funds transfer  this is because the procedure can be readily codified within the erp software  and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses who share that business requirement citation needed    erp systems connect to real time data and transaction data in a variety of ways these systems are typically configured by systems integrators  who bring unique knowledge on process  equipment  and vendor solutions     direct integration erp systems have connectivity  communications to plant floor equipment  as part of their product offering  this requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate  erp vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products  including those of their competitors     database integration erp systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database  plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database  the erp system reads the information in the table  the benefit of staging is that erp vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration  connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator     enterprise appliance transaction modules  eatm  these devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the erp system via methods supported by the erp system  eatm can employ a staging table  web services  or system specific program interfaces  apis   an eatm offers the benefit of being an off the shelf solution     custom integration solutions many system integrators offer custom solutions  these systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost  and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs  long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation  custom integrated solutions typically run on workstation or server class computers     erp s scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices    generally  three types of services are available to help implement such changes consulting  customization  and support    implementation time depends on business size  number of modules  customization  the scope of process changes  and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project  modular erp systems can be implemented in stages  the typical project for a large enterprise takes about    months and requires around     consultants    small projects can require months  multinational and other large implementations can take years citation needed customization can substantially increase implementation times       besides that  information processing influences various business functions e g  some large corporations like wal mart use a just in time inventory system  this reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency  and requires up to date data  before       walmart used a system called inforem developed by ibm to manage replenishment       implementing erp typically requires changes in existing business processes    poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure    the difficulties could be related to the system  business process  infrastructure  training  or lack of motivation       it is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement erp software  analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization  it also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the erp system  research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by     erp implementation is considerably more difficult  and politically charged  in decentralized organizations  because they often have different processes  business rules  data semantics  authorization hierarchies  and decision centers    this may require migrating some business units before others  delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit  possibly reducing integration  e g   linking via master data management  or customizing the system to meet specific needs       a potential disadvantage is that adopting  standard  processes can lead to a loss of competitive advantage  while this has happened  losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas  increasing overall competitive advantage         configuring an erp system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work  erp systems typically include many settings that modify system operations  for example  an organization can select the type of inventory accounting fifo or lifo to use  whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit  product line  or distribution channel  and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns       two tier erp software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two erp systems at once  one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level  for example  a manufacturing companywho  uses an erp system to manage across the organization  this company uses independent global or regional distribution  production or sales centers  and service providers to support the main company s customers  each independent center or subsidiary may have its own business models  workflows  and business processes     given the realities of globalization  enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional  divisional  and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time to market while increasing profitability and delivering value    with two tier erp  the regional distribution  production  or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model separate from the main company  using their own erp systems  since these smaller companies  processes and workflows are not tied to main company s processes and workflows  they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations       factors that affect enterprises  adoption of two tier erp systems include     erp systems are theoretically based on industry best practices  and their makers intend that organizations deploy them as is      erp vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules  but often feature gaps remain even after configuration is complete     erp customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps  each with their own pros cons  technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software  writing a homegrown module to work within the erp system  or interfacing to an external system  these three options constitute varying degrees of system customization with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain    alternatively  there are non technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered erp feature set  key differences between customization and configuration include     customization advantages include that it     customization disadvantages include that it     erp systems can be extended with third party software    erp vendors typically provide access to data and features through published interfaces  extensions offer features such as citation needed    data migration is the process of moving  copying  and restructuring data from an existing system to the erp system  migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning  unfortunately  since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase  it often receives insufficient attention  the following steps can structure migration planning       the fundamental advantage of erp is that integrated myriad businesses processes saves time and expense  management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors  data becomes visible across the organization  tasks that benefit from this integration include citation needed    erp systems centralize business data  which     recognized erp limitations have sparked new trends in erp application development  development is taking place in four significant areas  more flexible erp  web enabled erp  inter enterprise erp  and e business suites
