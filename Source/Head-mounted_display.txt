 a head mounted display  or helmet mounted display  for aviation applications   both abbreviated hmd  is a display device  worn on the head or as part of a helmet  that has a small display optic in front of one  monocular hmd  or each eye  binocular hmd      there is also an optical head mounted display  ohmd   which is a wearable display that has the capability of reflecting projected images as well as allowing the user to see through it             a typical hmd has either one or two small displays with lenses and semi transparent mirrors embedded in a helmet  eyeglasses  also known as data glasses  or visor  the display units are miniaturised and may include crt  lcds  liquid crystal on silicon  lcos   or oled  some vendors employ multiple micro displays to increase total resolution and field of view     hmds differ in whether they can display just a computer generated image  cgi   show live images from the real world or a combination of both     an optical head mounted display uses an optical mixer which is made of partly silvered mirrors  it has the capability of reflecting artificial images as well as letting real images to cross the lens and let the user to look through it     various techniques have existed for see through hmd s  most of these techniques can be summarized into two main families   curved mirror  based and  waveguide  based  the curved mirror technique has been used by vuzix in their star      product and by laster technologies  various waveguide techniques have existed for some time  these techniques include diffraction optics  holographic optics  polarized optics  and reflective optics     major hmd applications include military  governmental  fire  police  etc   and civilian commercial  medicine  video gaming  sports  etc       ruggedized hmds are increasingly being integrated into the cockpits of modern helicopters and fighter aircraft  these are usually fully integrated with the pilot s flying helmet and may include protective visors  night vision devices and displays of other symbology     military  police and firefighters use hmds to display tactical information such as maps or thermal imaging data while viewing the real scene  recent applications have included the use of hmd for paratroopers   in       the liteye hmd was introduced for ground combat troops as a rugged  waterproof lightweight display that clips into a standard us pvs    military helmet mount  the self contained color monocular oled display replaces the nvg tube and connects to a mobile computing device  the le has see through capability and can be used as a standard hmd or for augmented reality applications  the design is optimized to provide high definition data under all lighting conditions  in covered or see through modes of operation  the le has a low power consumption  operating on four aa batteries for    hours or receiving power via standard usb connection      darpa continues to fund research in augmented reality hmds as part of the persistent close air support  pcas  program  vuzix is currently working on a system for pcas that will use holographic waveguides to produce see through augmented reality glasses that are only a few millimeters thick      engineers and scientists use hmds to provide stereoscopic views of cad schematics citation needed these systems are also used in the maintenance of complex systems  as they can give a technician what is effectively  x ray vision  by combining computer graphics such as system diagrams and imagery with the technician s natural vision  there are also applications in surgery  wherein a combination of radiographic data  cat scans and mri imaging  is combined with the surgeon s natural view of the operation  and anesthesia  where the patient vital signs are within the anesthesiologist s field of view at all times      research universities often use hmds to conduct studies related to vision  balance  cognition and neuroscience     as of       the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied  in visual tracking tests  a hmd unit with eye tracking capability shows an object moving in a regular pattern  people without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory  the test requires both attention and working memory which are difficult functions for people with mild traumatic brain injury  the question being studied  is whether results for people with brain injury will show visual tracking gaze errors relative to the moving target      low cost hmd devices are available for use with  d games and entertainment applications     one of the first commercially available hmds was the forte vfx   which was announced at ces in        the vfx   had stereoscopic displays    axis head tracking  and stereo headphones     another pioneer in this field was sony who released the glasstron in       which had as an optional accessory a positional sensor which permitted the user to view the surroundings  with the perspective moving as the head moved  providing a deep sense of immersion     one novel application of this technology was in the game mechwarrior    which permitted users of the sony glasstron or virtual i o s iglasses to adopt a new visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft  using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft s own cockpit     sony has released the personal  d viewer  or hmz t    a fully surround sound headset for  d gaming and movies      sensics demonstrated at ces      a gaming and entertainment goggle that included an on board android processor as well as hand tracking to facilitate natural interaction      many brands of video glasses can now be connected to video and dslr cameras  making them applicable as a new age monitor  as a result of the glasses ability to block out ambient light  filmmakers and photographers are able to see clearer presentations of their live images      the oculus rift is an upcoming virtual reality  vr  head mounted display created by palmer luckey that the company oculus vr is developing for virtual reality simulations and video games       vr headsets are also planned for use with game consoles like the xbox one and the ps   the xbox vr headset is reportedly named fortaleza       a hmd system has been developed for formula one drivers by kopin corp  and the bmw group  according to bmw   the hmd is part of an advanced telemetry system approved for installation by the formula one racing committee  to communicate to the driver wirelessly from the heart of the race pit   the hmd will display critical race data while allowing the driver to continue focussing on the track  pit crews control the data and messages sent to their drivers through two way radio       recon instruments released on   november      two head mounted displays for ski goggles  mod and mod live  the later based on an android operating system       a key application for hmds is training and simulation  allowing to virtually place a trainee in a situation that is either too expensive or too dangerous to replicate in real life  training with hmds cover a wide range of applications from driving  welding and spray painting  flight and vehicle simulators  dismounted soldier training  medical procedure training and more     depth perception inside an hmd requires different images for the left and right eyes  there are multiple ways to provide these separate images     the advantage of dual video inputs is that it provides the maximum resolution for each image and the maximum frame rate for each eye  the disadvantage of dual video inputs is that it requires separate video outputs and cables from the device generating the content     time based multiplexing preserves the full resolution per each image  but reduces the frame rate by half  for example  if the signal is presented at   xa hz  each eye is receiving just   xa hz updates  this may become an issue with accurately presenting fast moving images     side by side and top bottom multiplexing provide full rate updates to each eye  but reduce the resolution presented to each eye  many  d broadcasts  such as espn  chose to provide side by side  d which saves the need to allocate extra transmission bandwidth and is more suitable to fast paced sports action relative to time based multiplexing techniques     not all hmds provide depth perception  some lower end modules are essentially bi ocular devices where both eyes are presented with the same image      d video players sometimes allow maximum compatibility with hmds by providing the user with a choice of the  d format to be used     companies that have produced hmds include
