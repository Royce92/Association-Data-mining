 the apache http server  colloquially called apache     p t i     pa chee   is the world s most widely used web server software  originally based on the ncsa httpd server  development of apache began in early      after work on the ncsa code stalled  apache played a key role in the initial growth of the world wide web   quickly overtaking ncsa httpd as the dominant http server  and has remained the most popular http server since april       in       it became the first web server software to serve more than     million websites      apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the apache software foundation  most commonly used on a unix like system  usually linux    the software is available for a wide variety of operating systems  including unix  freebsd  linux  solaris  novell netware  os x  microsoft windows  os    tpf  openvms and ecomstation  released under the apache license  apache is free and open source software     as of june     update  apache was estimated to serve       of all active web sites and       of the top servers across all domains                    according to the faq in the apache project website  the name apache was chosen out of respect to the native american tribe apache and its superior skills in warfare and strategy  the name was widely believed to be a pun on a patchy server  since it was a set of software patches   but this is erroneous    official documentation used to give this very explanation of the name    but in a      interview  brian behlendorf  one of the creators of apache  set the record straight       the name literally came out of the blue  i wish i could say that it was something fantastic  but it was out of the blue  i put it on a page and then a few months later when this project started  i pointed people to this page and said   hey  what do you think of that idea       someone said they liked the name and that it was a really good pun  and i was like   a pun  what do you mean   he said   well  we re building a server out of a bunch of software patches  right  so it s a patchy web server   i went   oh  all right       when i thought of the name  no  it just sort of connotated   take no prisoners  be kind of aggressive and kick some ass      when apache is running  its process name is sometimes httpd  which is short for  http daemon      apache supports a variety of features  many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality  these can range from server side programming language support to authentication schemes  some common language interfaces support perl  python  tcl  and php  popular authentication modules include mod_access  mod_auth  mod_digest  and mod_auth_digest  the successor to mod_digest  a sample of other features include secure sockets layer and transport layer security support  mod_ssl   a proxy module  mod_proxy   a url rewriter  mod_rewrite   custom log files  mod_log_config   and filtering support  mod_include and mod_ext_filter      popular compression methods on apache include the external extension module  mod_gzip  implemented to help with reduction of the size  weight  of web pages served over http  modsecurity is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for web applications  apache logs can be analyzed through a web browser using free scripts  such as awstats w perl or visitors     virtual hosting allows one apache installation to serve many different web sites  for example  one machine with one apache installation could simultaneously serve www example com  www example org  test   test server example edu  etc     apache features configurable error messages  dbms based authentication databases  and content negotiation  it is also supported by several graphical user interfaces  guis      it supports password authentication and digital certificate authentication  because the source code is freely available  anyone can adapt the server for specific needs  and there is a large public library of apache add ons       instead of implementing a single architecture  apache provides a variety of multiprocessing modules  mpms   which allow apache to run in a process based  hybrid  process and thread  or event hybrid mode  to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure  this implies that the choice of correct mpm and the correct configuration is important  where compromises in performance need to be made  the design of apache is to reduce latency and increase throughput  relative to simply handling more requests  thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time frames     for delivery of static pages  apache     series was considered significantly slower than nginx    to address this issue  the apache version considered by the apache foundation as providing high performance is the multi threaded version  which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process    this architecture  and the way it was implemented in the apache     series  provides for performance equivalent or slightly better than event based web servers  as is claimed by the president of the apache foundation  jim jagielski    however  some independent benchmarks show that it still is half as fast as nginx         the apache http server codebase was relicensed to the apache     license  from the previous     license  in january         and apache http server        and        were the first releases using the new license       the openbsd project did not like the change and continued the use of pre     apache versions  effectively forking apache     x for its purposes        later it switched to nginx           the apache http server project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust  commercial grade  feature rich and freely available source code implementation of an http  web  server  the project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world  using the internet and the web to communicate  plan  and develop the server and its related documentation  this project is part of the apache software foundation  in addition  hundreds of users have contributed ideas  code  and documentation to the project
