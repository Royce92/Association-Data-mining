 a census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population  it is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population   the term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses  other common censuses include agriculture  business  and traffic censuses  the united nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as  individual enumeration  universality within a defined territory  simultaneity and defined periodicity   and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every    years  united nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected  official definitions  classifications and other useful information to coordinate international practice       the word is of latin origin  during the roman republic  the census was a list that kept track of all adult males fit for military service but now enumerates all those resident in a country  the modern census is essential to international comparisons of any kind of statistics  and censuses collect data on many attributes of a population  not just how many people there are but now census takes its place within a system of surveys where it typically began as the only national demographic data collection  although population estimates remain an important function of a census  including exactly the geographic distribution of the population  statistics can be produced about combinations of attributes e g  education by age and sex in different regions  current administrative data systems allow for other approaches to enumeration with the same level of detail but raise concerns about privacy and the possibility of biasing estimates     a census can be contrasted with sampling in which information is obtained only from a subset of a population  typically main population estimates are updated by such intercensal estimates  modern census data are commonly used for research  business marketing  and planning  and as a baseline for designing sample surveys by providing a sampling frame such as an address register  census counts are necessary to adjust samples to be representative of a population by weighting them as is common in opinion polling  similarly  stratification requires knowledge of the relative sizes of different population strata which can be derived from census enumerations  in some countries  the census provides the official counts used to apportion the number of elected representatives to regions  sometimes controversially   e g   utah v  evans              a census is often construed as the opposite of a sample as its intent is to count everyone in a population rather than a fraction  however  population censuses relies on a sampling frame to count the population  this is the only way to be sure that everyone has been included as otherwise those not responding would not be followed up on and individuals could be missed  the fundamental premise of a census is that the population is not known and a new estimate is to be made by the analysis of primary data  the use of a sampling frame is counterintuitive as it suggests that the population size is already known  however  a census is also used to collect attribute data on the individuals in the nation  this process of sampling marks the difference between historical census  which was a house to house process or the product of an imperial decree  and the modern statistical project  the sampling frame used by census is almost always an address register  thus it is not known if there is anyone resident or how many people there are in each household  depending on the mode of enumeration  a form is sent to the householder  an enumerator calls  or administrative records for the dwelling are accessed  as a preliminary to the dispatch of forms  census workers will check any address problems on the ground  while it may seem straightforward to use the postal service file for this purpose  this can be out of date and some dwellings may contain a number of independent households  a particular problem is what are termed  communal establishments  which category includes student residences  religious orders  homes for the elderly  people in prisons etc  as these are not easily enumerated by a single householder  they are often treated differently and visited by special teams of census workers to ensure they are classified appropriately     individuals are normally counted within households and information is typically collected about the household structure and the housing  for this reason international documents refer to censuses of population and housing  normally the census response is made by a household  indicating details of individuals resident there  an important aspect of census enumerations is determining which individuals can be counted from which cannot be counted  broadly  three definitions can be used  de facto residence  de jure residence  and  permanent residence  this is important to consider individuals who have multiple or temporary addresses  every person should be identified uniquely as resident in one place but where they happen to be on census day  their de facto residence  may not be the best place to count them  where an individual uses services may be more useful and this is at their usual  or de jure  residence  an individual may be represented at a permanent address  perhaps a family home for students or long term migrants  it is necessary to have a precise definition of residence to decide whether visitors to a country should be included in the population count  this is becoming more important as students travel abroad for education for a period of several years  other groups causing problems of enumeration are new born babies  refugees  people away on holiday  people moving home around census day  and people without a fixed address  people having second homes because of working in another part of the country or retaining a holiday cottage are difficult to fix at a particular address sometimes causing double counting or houses being mistakenly identified as vacant  another problem is where people use a different address at different times e g  students living at their place of education in term time but returning to a family home during vacations or children whose parents have separated who effectively have two family homes  census enumeration has always been based on finding people where they live as there is no systematic alternative   any list you could use to find people is derived from census activities in the first place  recent un guidelines provide recommendation on enumerating such complex households      historical censuses used crude enumeration assuming absolute accuracy  modern approaches take into account the problems of overcount and undercount  and the coherence of census enumerations with other official sources of data   this reflects a realist approach to measurement  acknowledging that under any definition of residence there is a true value of the population but this can never be measured with complete accuracy  an important aspect of the census process is to evaluate the quality of the data      many countries use a post enumeration survey to adjust the raw census counts   this works in a similar manner to capture recapture estimation for animal populations  in census circles this method is called dual system enumeration  dse   a sample of households are visited by interviewers who record the details of the household as at census day  these data are then matched to census records and the number of people missed can be estimated by considering the number missed in the census or survey but counted in the other  this way counts can be adjusted for non response varying between different demographic groups  an explanation using a fishing analogy can be found in  trout  catfish and roach      which won an award from the royal statistical society for excellence in official statistics in          triple system enumeration has been proposed as an improvement as it would allow evaluation of the statistical dependence of pairs of sources  however  as the matching process is the most difficult aspect of census estimation this has never been implemented for a national enumeration  it would also be difficult to identify three different sources that were sufficiently different to make the triple system effort worthwhile  the dse approach has another weakness in that it assumes there is no person counted twice  over count   in de facto residence definitions this would not be a problem but in de jure definitions individuals risk being recorded on more than one form leading to double counting  a particular problem here are students who often have a term time and family address     several countries have used a system which is known as short form long form   this is a sampling strategy which randomly chooses a proportion of people to send a more detailed questionnaire to  the long form   everyone receives the short form questions  thereby more data are collected but not imposing a burden on the whole population  this also reduces the burden on the statistical office  indeed in the uk all residents were required to fill in the whole form but only a     sample were coded and analysed in detail  until         new technology means that all data are now scanned and processed  recently there has been controversy in canada about the cessation of the long form with the head  munir sheikh resigning       the use of alternative enumeration strategies is increasing   but these are not so simple as many people assume and only occur in developed countries    the netherlands has been most advanced in adopting a census using administrative data  this allows a simulated census to be conducted by linking several different administrative databases at an agreed time  data can be matched and an overall enumeration established accounting for where the different sources are discrepant  a validation survey is still conducted in a similar way to the post enumeration survey employed in a traditional census  other countries which have a population register use this as a basis for all the census statistics needed by users  this is most common amongst nordic countries but requires a large number of different registers to be combined including population  housing  employment and education  these registers are then combined and brought up to the standard of a statistical register by comparing the data in different sources and ensuring the quality is sufficient for official statistics to be produced    a recent innovation is the french instigation of a rolling census programme with different regions enumerated each year such that the whole country is completely enumerated every   to    years citation needed in europe  in connection with the      census round  a large number of countries adopted alternative census methodologies  often based on the combination of data from registers  surveys and other sources       censuses have evolved in their use of technology with the latest censuses  the      round  using many new types of computing  in brazil  handheld devices were used by enumerators to locate residences on the ground  in many countries  census returns could be made via the internet as well as in paper form  dse is facilitated by computer matching techniques which can be automated  such as propensity score matching  in the uk  all census formats are scanned and stored electronically before being destroyed  replacing the need for physical archives  the record linking to perform an administrative census would not be possible without large databases being stored on computer systems     new technology is not without problems in its introduction  the us census had intended to use the handheld computers but cost escalated and this was abandoned  with the contract being sold to brazil  online response is a good idea but one of the functions of census is to make sure everyone is counted accurately  a system which allowed people to enter their address without verification would be open to abuse  therefore households have to be verified on the ground  typically by an enumerator visit or post out  paper forms are still necessary for those without access to internet connections  it is also plausible that the hidden nature of an administrative census means that users are not engaged with the importance of contributing their data to official statistics     in the nineteenth century  the first censuses collected paper enumerations that had to be collated by hand so the statistical uses were very basic  the government owned the data and were able to publish statistics themselves on the state of the nation  uses were to measure changes in the population and apportion representation  population estimates could be compared to those of other countries     by the beginning of the twentieth century  censuses were recording households and some indications of their employment  in some countries  census archives are released for public examination after many decades  allowing genealogists to track the ancestry of interested people  archives provide a substantial historical record which may challenge established notions of tradition  it is also possible to understand the societal history through job titles and arrangements for the destitute and sick     as governments assumed responsibility for schooling and welfare  large government departments made extensive use of census data  actuarial estimates could be made to project populations and plan for provision in local government and regions  it was also possible for central government to allocate funding on the basis of census data  even into the mid twentieth century  census data was only directly accessible to large government departments  however  computers meant that tabulations could be used directly by university researchers  large businesses and local government offices  they could use the detail of the data to answer new questions and add to local and specialist knowledge     now  census data are published in a wide variety of formats to be accessible to business  all levels of governance  media  students and teachers  charities and researchers  and any citizen who is interested  data can be represented visually or analysed in complex statistical models  to show the difference between certain areas  or to understand the association between different personal characteristics  census data offer a unique insight into small areas and small demographic groups which sample data would be unable to capture with precision     although the census provides a useful way of obtaining statistical information about a population  such information can sometimes lead to abuses  political or otherwise  made possible by the linking of individuals  identities to anonymous census data    this consideration is particularly important when individuals  census responses are made available in microdata form  but even aggregate level data can result in privacy breaches when dealing with small areas and or rare subpopulations     for instance  when reporting data from a large city  it might be appropriate to give the average income for black males aged between    and     however  doing this for a town that only has two black males in this age group would be a breach of privacy because either of those persons  knowing his own income and the reported average  could determine the other man s income     typically  census data are processed to obscure such individual information  some agencies do this by intentionally introducing small statistical errors to prevent the identification of individuals in marginal populations    others swap variables for similar respondents  whatever measures have been taken to reduce the privacy risk in census data  new technology in the form of better electronic analysis of data poses increasing challenges to the protection of sensitive individual information  this known as statistical disclosure control     another possibility is to present survey results by means of statistical models in the form of a multivariate distribution mixture    the statistical information in the form of conditional distributions  histograms  can be derived interactively from the estimated mixture model without any further access to the original database  as the final product does not contain any protected microdata  the model based interactive software can be distributed without any confidentiality concerns     another method is simply to release no data at all  except very large scale data directly to the central government  different release strategies between government have led to an international project  ipums  to co ordinate access to microdata and corresponding metadata  such projects also promote standardising metadata by projects such as sdmx so that best use can be made of the minimal data available     censuses in egypt are said to have been taken during the early pharaonic period in      bce and in      bce citation needed    there are several accounts of ancient greek and mesopotamian city states carrying out censuses    the question of which is first is clouded by very different approaches  counting only men  counting a pile of rocks etc  but such censuses took place      bce and earlier citation needed    censuses are mentioned in the bible  god commands a per capita tax to be paid with the census in exodus          for the upkeep of the tabernacle  the book of numbers is named after the counting of the israelite population  in numbers      according to the house of the fathers after the exodus from egypt  a second census was taken while the israelite were camped in the plains of moab  in numbers        king david performed a census that produced disastrous results  in  xa samuel    and  xa chronicles      his son  king solomon  had all of the foreigners in israel counted in  xa chronicles          when the romans took over judea in  ce  the legate publius sulpicius quirinius organised a census for tax purposes  the gospel of luke links the birth of jesus to this event  luke       in   ce during the han dynasty  china held a census still considered by scholars to be quite accurate      the census is considered one of the world s earliest preserved censuses    and found      xa million people registered in      xa million households      the areas with the highest population densities were the yellow river and huai river valleys  chengdu was the largest city in china  reaching a population of         people    another census dates to ad      when      xa million people were recorded living in     xa million households     the oldest recorded census in india is thought to have occurred around     bce during the reign of the emperor chandragupta maurya under the leadership of kautilya or chanakya       the word  census  originated in ancient rome from the latin word censere   to estimate    the census played a crucial role in the administration of the roman empire  as it was used to determine taxes  with few interruptions  it was usually carried out every five years    it provided a register of citizens and their property from which their duties and privileges could be listed  it is said to have been instituted by the roman king servius tullius in the  th century bce    at which time the number of arms bearing citizens was supposedly counted at around              in the middle ages  the caliphate began conducting regular censuses soon after its formation  beginning with the one ordered by the second rashidun caliph  umar       the domesday book was undertaken in      ce by william i of england so that he could properly tax the land he had recently conquered in medieval europe  in      ce  a census was taken of the crusader kingdom of jerusalem  to ascertain the number of men and amount of money that could possibly be raised against an invasion by saladin  sultan of egypt and syria     in the   th century  the inca empire had a unique way to record census information  the incas did not have any written language but recorded information collected during censuses and other numeric information as well as non numeric data on quipus  strings from llama or alpaca hair or cotton cords with numeric and other values encoded by knots in a base    positional system     on may           king philip ii of spain ordered by royal c dula the preparation of a general description of spain s holdings in the indies  instructions and a questionnaire  issued in      by the office of the cronista mayor  were distributed to local officials in the viceroyalties of new spain and peru to direct the gathering of information  the questionnaire  composed of fifty items  was designed to elicit basic information about the nature of the land and the life of its peoples  the replies  known as  relaciones geogr ficas   were written between      and      and were returned to the cronista mayor in spain by the council of the indies
