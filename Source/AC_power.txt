 power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit  in alternating current circuits  energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow  the portion of power that  averaged over a complete cycle of the ac waveform  results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as active power  sometimes also called real power   the portion of power due to stored energy  which returns to the source in each cycle  is known as reactive power             in a simple alternating current  ac  circuit consisting of a source and a linear load  both the current and voltage are sinusoidal  if the load is purely resistive  the two quantities reverse their polarity at the same time  at every instant the product of voltage and current is positive  indicating that the direction of energy flow does not reverse  in this case  only active power is transferred     if the loads are purely reactive  then the voltage and current are    degrees out of phase  for half of each cycle  the product of voltage and current is positive  but on the other half of the cycle  the product is negative  indicating that on average  exactly as much energy flows toward the load as flows back  there is no net energy flow over one cycle  in this case  only reactive power flows there is no net transfer of energy to the load     practical loads have resistance  inductance  and capacitance  so both active and reactive power will flow to real loads  power engineers measure apparent power as the magnitude of the vector sum of active and reactive power  apparent power is the product of the root mean square of voltage and current     engineers care about apparent power  because even though the current associated with reactive power does no work at the load  it heats the wires and wastes energy  conductors  transformers and generators must be sized to carry the total current  not just the current that does useful work     another consequence is that adding the apparent power for two loads will not accurately give the total apparent power unless they have the same displacement between current and voltage  the same power factor      conventionally  capacitors are considered to generate reactive power and inductors to consume it  if a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel  then the currents flowing through the inductor and the capacitor tend to cancel rather than add  this is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission  capacitors  or inductors  are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate reactive power  consumed  by the load     engineers use the following terms to describe energy flow in a system  and assign each of them a different unit to differentiate between them      in the diagram  p is the active power  q is the reactive power  in this case positive   s is the complex power and the length of s is the apparent power  reactive power does not do any work  so it is represented as the imaginary axis of the vector diagram  active power does do work  so it is the real axis     the unit for all forms of power is the watt  symbol  w   but this unit is generally reserved for active power  apparent power is conventionally expressed in volt amperes  va  since it is the product of rms voltage and rms current  the unit for reactive power is expressed as var  which stands for volt ampere reactive  since reactive power transfers no net energy to the load  it is sometimes called  wattless  power  it does  however  serve an important function in electrical grids and its lack has been cited as a significant factor in the northeast blackout of           understanding the relationship among these three quantities lies at the heart of understanding power engineering  the mathematical relationship among them can be represented by vectors or expressed using complex numbers  s   p   jq  where j is the imaginary unit      the ratio between active power and apparent power in a circuit is called the power factor  for two systems transmitting the same amount of active power  the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load  these higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall transmission efficiency  a lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of active power     the power factor is one when the voltage and current are in phase  it is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by    degrees  power factors are usually stated as  leading  or  lagging  to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage     purely capacitive circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by    degrees  while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by    degrees  the result of this is that capacitive and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out     where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal  the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle     between the current and voltage sinusoid waveforms  equipment data sheets and nameplates often will abbreviate power factor as    for this reason     example  the active power is     w and the phase angle between voltage and current is        the power factor is cos                 the apparent power is then      w   cos               va      in a direct current circuit  the power flowing to the load is proportional to the product of the current through the load and the potential drop across the load  energy flows in one direction from the source to the load     in alternating current  ac  systems power may periodically reverse direction during each cycle of voltage  or current   stored energy in the magnetic or electric field of a load device  such as a motor or capacitor  causes an offset between the current and the voltage waveforms  the power flow has two components   one component flows steadily from source to load and can perform work at the load  the other portion  known as  reactive power   is due to the delay between voltage and current and cannot do useful work at the load  to distinguish reactive power from active power  it is measured in units of  volt amperes reactive    var      while reactive power does not provide useful work  it is a necessary component of power flow in an alternating current system  reactive power required by customer load must be supplied in some way     reactive power flow is needed in an alternating current transmission system to support the transfer of active power over the network  in alternating current circuits  energy is stored temporarily in inductive and capacitive elements  ac connected devices that store energy in the form of a magnetic field include inductors  a large coil of wire   when a voltage is initially placed across the coil  a magnetic field builds up  and it takes a period of time for the current to reach full value  this causes the current to lag behind the voltage in phase  hence  these devices are said to be sources of lagging reactive power     a capacitor is an ac device that stores energy in the form of an electric field  when current is driven through the capacitor  it takes a period of time for a charge to build up to produce the full voltage difference  on an ac network  the voltage across a capacitor is constantly changing   the capacitor will oppose this change  causing the voltage to lag behind the current  in other words  the current leads the voltage in phase  hence  these devices are said to be sources of leading reactive power     the power system requires both types of power   active and reactive   in order to function properly  electric generators supply reactive power  in addition to active power  that is consumed by customer load     the shifting effect of motors can also be offset using devices that counteract this shift the most common are capacitors  such capacitors are the largest source of this offsetting reactive power and are commonly used throughout the power system     another source of reactive power is a synchronous condenser a kind of electric generator that does not produce active power  only reactive power  there are also other devices that use high power electronics to rapidly control reactive power from large banks of capacitors     energy stored in capacitive or inductive elements of the network give rise to reactive power flow  reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network  voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits     transmission connected generators are generally required to support reactive power flow  for example on the united kingdom transmission system generators are required by the grid code requirements to supply their rated power between the limits of      power factor lagging and      power factor leading at the designated terminals  the system operator will perform switching actions to maintain a secure and economical voltage profile while maintaining a reactive power balance equation     the  system gain  is an important source of reactive power in the above power balance equation  which is generated by the capacitive nature of the transmission network itself  by making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases  the system gain can be maximized early on  helping to secure the system for the whole day     to balance the equation some pre fault reactive generator use will be required  other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors  shunt reactors  static var compensators and voltage control circuits     while active power and reactive power are well defined in any system  the definition of apparent power for unbalanced polyphase systems is considered to be one of the most controversial topics in power engineering  originally  apparent power arose merely as a figure of merit  major delineations of the concept are attributed to stanley s phenomena of retardation in the induction coil        and steinmetz s theoretical elements of engineering         however  with the development of three phase power distribution  it became clear that the definition of apparent power and the power factor could not be applied to unbalanced polyphase systems  in       a  special joint committee of the aiee and the national electric light association  met to resolve the issue  they considered two definitions     that is  the quotient of the sums of the active powers for each phase over the sum of the apparent power for each phase     that is  the quotient of the sums of the active powers for each phase over the magnitude of the sum of the complex powers for each phase     the      committee found no consensus and the topic continued to dominate discussions  in      another committee formed and once again failed to resolve the question  the transcripts of their discussions are the lengthiest and most controversial ever published by the aiee  emanuel         further resolution of this debate did not come until the late     s     a perfect resistor stores no energy  so current and voltage are in phase  therefore there is no reactive power and   therefore for a perfect resistor    for a perfect capacitor or inductor there is no net power transfer  so all power is reactive  therefore for a perfect capacitor or inductor     where x is the reactance of the capacitor or inductor     if x is defined as being positive for an inductor and negative for a capacitor then we can remove the modulus signs from s and x and get    instantaneous power is defined as     where v t  and i t  are the time varying voltage and current waveforms     this definition is useful because it applies to all waveforms  whether they are sinusoidal or not  this is particularly useful in power electronics  where nonsinusoidal waveforms are common     in general  we are interested in the active power averaged over a period of time  whether it is a low frequency line cycle or a high frequency power converter switching period  the simplest way to get that result is to take the integral of the instantaneous calculation over the desired period     this method of calculating the average power gives the active power regardless of harmonic content of the waveform  in practical applications  this would be done in the digital domain  where the calculation becomes trivial when compared to the use of rms and phase to determine active power     since an rms value can be calculated for any waveform  apparent power can be calculated from this     for active power it would at first appear that we would have to calculate loads of product terms and average all of them  however if we look at one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result     however the time average of a function of the form cos  t k  is zero provided that   is nonzero  therefore the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match  in other words it is possible to calculate active  average  power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers     furthermore  if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency  which it usually is   this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing  they will increase the rms current  since there will be non zero terms added  and therefore apparent power  but they will have no effect on the active power transferred  hence  harmonic currents will reduce the power factor     harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device  typically this will consist of either just a capacitor  relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply  or a capacitor inductor network  an active power factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity
