 in computing  an abstraction layer or abstraction level is a way of hiding the implementation details of a particular set of functionality  allowing the separation of concerns to facilitate interoperability and platform independence  software models that use layers of abstraction include the osi   layer model for computer network protocols  the opengl graphics drawing library  and the byte stream input output  i o  model originated by unix and adopted by ms dos  linux  and most other modern operating systems     in the unix operating system  most types of input and output operations are considered to be streams of bytes read from a device or written to a device  this stream of bytes model is used for file i o  socket i o  and terminal i o in order to provide device independence  in order to read and write to a device at the application level  the program calls a function to open the device which may be a real device such as a terminal or a virtual device such as a network port or a file in a file system  the device s physical characteristics are mediated by the operating system which in turn presents an abstract interface that allows the programmer to read and write bytes from to the device  the operating system then performs the actual transformation needed to read and write the stream of bytes to the device     most graphics libraries such as opengl provide an abstract graphical device model as an interface  the library is responsible for translating the commands provided by the programmer into the specific device commands needed to draw the graphical elements and objects  the specific device commands for a plotter are different from the device commands for a crt monitor but the graphics library hides the implementation and device dependent details by providing an abstract interface which provides a set of primitives that are generally useful for drawing graphical objects     in computer science  an abstraction level is a generalization of a model or algorithm  away from any specific implementation  these generalizations arise from broad similarities that are best encapsulated by models that express similarities present in various specific implementations  the simplification provided by a good abstraction layer allows for easy reuse by distilling a useful concept or metaphor so that situations where it may be accurately applied can be quickly recognized     a good abstraction will generalize that which can be made abstract  while allowing specificity where the abstraction breaks down and its successful application requires customization to each unique requirement or problem     frequently abstraction layers can be composed into a hierarchy of abstraction levels  the iso osi networking model comprises seven abstraction layers  each layer of the osi iso networking model encapsulates and addresses a different part of the needs of much digital communications  thereby reducing the complexity of the associated engineering solutions     a famous aphorism of david wheeler reads  all problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection   this is often deliberately mis quoted with  abstraction  substituted for  indirection   it is also sometimes misattributed to butler lampson  kevlin henney s corollary to this is      except for the problem of too many layers of indirection      in computer architecture  a computer system is usually represented as consisting of five abstraction levels  hardware  see hardware abstraction   firmware  assembler  operating system and processes
