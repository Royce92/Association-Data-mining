 systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles  issues such as requirements engineering  reliability  logistics  coordination of different teams  testing and evaluation  reliability  maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development  design  implementation  and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects  systems engineering deals with work processes  optimization methods  and risk management tools in such projects  it overlaps technical and human centered disciplines such as control engineering  industrial engineering  software engineering  organizational studies  and project management  systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered  and integrated into a whole     the systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process  a manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time  the systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problem that needs to be solved  the biggest failure that can be made in systems engineering is finding an elegant solution to the wrong problem             the term systems engineering can be traced back to bell telephone laboratories in the     s   the need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole  which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts  properties  motivated various industries to apply the discipline      when it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands  new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly   the continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques  these methods aid in better comprehension of engineering systems as they grow more complex  popular tools that are often used in the systems engineering context were developed during these times  including usl  uml  qfd  and idef      in       a professional society for systems engineering  the national council on systems engineering  ncose   was founded by representatives from a number of u s  corporations and organizations  ncose was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education  as a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the u s   the name of the organization was changed to the international council on systems engineering  incose  in        schools in several countries offer graduate programs in systems engineering  and continuing education options are also available for practicing engineers      systems engineering signifies only an approach and  more recently  a discipline in engineering  the aim of education in systems engineering is to simply formalize the approach and in doing so  identify new methods and research opportunities similar to the way it occurs in other fields of engineering  as an approach  systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour     the traditional scope of engineering embraces the design  development  production and operation of physical systems  and systems engineering  as originally conceived  falls within this scope   systems engineering   in this sense of the term  refers to the distinctive set of concepts  methodologies  organizational structures  and so on  that have been developed to meet the challenges of engineering functional physical systems of unprecedented complexity  the apollo program is a leading example of a systems engineering project     the use of the term  systems engineer  has evolved over time to embrace a wider  more holistic concept of  systems  and of engineering processes  this evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy    and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope     traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense  that is  as applied only to physical system  such as space craft and aircraft  more recently  systems engineering has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system  checkland  for example  captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that  engineering   can be read in its general sense  you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement         consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering  the systems engineering body of knowledge  sebok     has defined three types of systems engineering      product systems engineering  pse  is the traditional systems engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware and software      enterprise systems engineering  ese  pertains to the view of enterprises  that is  organizations or combinations of organizations  as systems      service systems engineering  sse  has to do with the engineering of service systems  checkland    defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system  most civil infrastructure systems are service systems     systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle  documenting requirements  then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem  the system lifecycle  this includes fully understanding all of the stakeholders involved  oliver et al  claim that the systems engineering process can be decomposed into    within oliver s model  the goal of the management process is to organize the technical effort in the lifecycle  while the technical process includes assessing available information  defining effectiveness measures  to create a behavior model  create a structure model  perform trade off analysis  and create sequential build   test plan       depending on their application  although there are several models that are used in the industry  all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback  examples of such models include the waterfall model and the vee model       system development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines    by providing a systems  holistic  view of the development effort  systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort  forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and  in some cases  to termination and disposal     this perspective is often replicated in educational programs  in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments  which helps create an interdisciplinary environment         the need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects      in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction  and therefore the unreliability of the design  when speaking in this context  complexity incorporates not only engineering systems  but also the logical human organization of data  at the same time  a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data  variables  or the number of fields that are involved in the design  the international space station is an example of such a system     the development of smarter control algorithms  microprocessor design  and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems engineering  systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems  some examples of these tools can be seen here       taking an interdisciplinary approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since the behavior of and interaction among system components is not always immediately well defined or understood  defining and characterizing such systems and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of systems engineering  in doing so  the gap that exists between informal requirements from users  operators  marketing organizations  and technical specifications is successfully bridged     one way to understand the motivation behind systems engineering is to see it as a method  or practice  to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems citation needed keeping this in mind  the principles of systems engineeringxa   holism  emergent behavior  boundary  et al xa   can be applied to any system  complex or otherwise  provided systems thinking is employed at all levels    besides defense and aerospace  many information and technology based companies  software development firms  and industries in the field of electronics   communications require systems engineers as part of their team       an analysis by the incose systems engineering center of excellence  secoe  indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about        of the total project effort    at the same time  studies have shown that systems engineering essentially leads to reduction in costs among other benefits    however  no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety of industries has been conducted until recently  such studies are underway to determine the effectiveness and quantify the benefits of systems engineering         systems engineering encourages the use of modeling and simulation to validate assumptions or theories on systems and the interactions within them         use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures  in safety engineering  are integrated into the design process  at the same time  decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system  and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions  no method guarantees today s decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived  however  there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering  examples include soft systems methodology  jay wright forrester s system dynamics method  and the unified modeling language  uml  all currently being explored  evaluated  and developed to support the engineering decision process     education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular engineering courses    reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines  e g   aerospace engineering  automotive engineering  electrical engineering  mechanical engineering  industrial engineering  plus practical  real world experience to be effective as systems engineers  undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare  typically  systems engineering is offered at the graduate level in combination with interdisciplinary study     incose maintains a continuously updated directory of systems engineering academic programs worldwide   as of       there are about    institutions in united states that offer     undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering  education in systems engineering can be taken as systems centric or domain centric     both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core engineer       systems engineering tools are strategies  procedures  and techniques that aid in performing systems engineering on a project or product  the purpose of these tools vary from database management  graphical browsing  simulation  and reasoning  to document production  neutral import export and more       there are many definitions of what a system is in the field of systems engineering  below are a few authoritative definitions     depending on their application  tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process       models play important and diverse roles in systems engineering  a model can be defined in several ways  including       together  these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering models used in the verification of a system design  as well as schematic models like a functional flow block diagram and mathematical  i e   quantitative  models used in the trade study process  this section focuses on the last       the main reason for using mathematical models and diagrams in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness  performance or technical attributes  and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities  typically  a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables  the heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs  these relationships can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total  or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field  ideally  the relationships express causality  not just correlation    furthermore  key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems  however  diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering  and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities  under the title of  modeling   simulation based systems engineering        initially  when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a complex problem  graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a system s functional and data requirements    common graphical representations include     a graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system through functions  data  or interfaces  any or each of the above methods are used in an industry based on its requirements  for instance  the n  chart may be used where interfaces between systems is important  part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system     once the requirements are understood  it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them  and to determine  along with other engineers  the best technology for a job  at this point starting with a trade study  systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option  a decision matrix  or pugh method  is one way  qfd is another  to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important  the trade study in turn informs the design  which again affects graphic representations of the system  without changing the requirements   in an se process  this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found  a decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis  reliability analysis  system dynamics  feedback control   and optimization methods     systems modeling language  sysml   a modeling language used for systems engineering applications  supports the specification  analysis  design  verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems       lifecycle modeling language  lml   is an open standard modeling language designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle  conceptual  utilization  support and retirement stages       many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering  these areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering as a distinct entity
