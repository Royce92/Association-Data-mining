 coal  from the old english term col  which has meant  mineral of fossilized carbon  since the   th century   is a combustible black or brownish black sedimentary rock usually occurring in rock strata in layers or veins called coal beds or coal seams  the harder forms  such as anthracite coal  can be regarded as metamorphic rock because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure  coal is composed primarily of carbon along with variable quantities of other elements  chiefly hydrogen  sulfur  oxygen  and nitrogen      throughout history  coal has been used as an energy resource  primarily burned for the production of electricity and or heat  and is also used for industrial purposes  such as refining metals  a fossil fuel  coal forms when dead plant matter is converted into peat  which in turn is converted into lignite  then sub bituminous coal  after that bituminous coal  and lastly anthracite  this involves biological and geological processes that take place over a long period  the energy information administration estimates coal reserves at         short tons      gt    one estimate for resources is        gt      coal is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide  as well as one of the largest worldwide anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide releases  in       world gross carbon dioxide emissions from coal usage were       million tonnes of carbon dioxide   in       world gross emissions from coal usage were        million tonnes   coal fired electric power generation emits around       pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated  which is almost double the approximately      pounds of carbon dioxide released by a natural gas fired electric plant per megawatt hour generated  because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation  as the market in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions have fallen  those measured in the first quarter of      were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since        in       the head of the un climate agency advised that most of the world s coal reserves should be left in the ground to avoid catastrophic global warming      coal is extracted from the ground by coal mining  either underground by shaft mining  or at ground level by open pit mining extraction  since      the world top coal producer has been china   in      china produced       million tonnes of coal         of       million tonnes world coal production  in      other large producers were united states      million tonnes   india        european union       and australia         in      the largest exporters were australia with     million tonnes        of world coal export  and indonesia with     million tonnes            while the largest importers were japan with     million tonnes        of world coal import   china with     million tonnes         and south korea with     million tonnes                       at various times in the geologic past  the earth had dense forests in low lying wetland areas  due to natural processes such as flooding  these forests were buried underneath soil  as more and more soil deposited over them  they were compressed  the temperature also rose as they sank deeper and deeper  as the process continued the plant matter was protected from biodegradation and oxidation  usually by mud or acidic water  this trapped the carbon in immense peat bogs that were eventually covered and deeply buried by sediments  under high pressure and high temperature  dead vegetation was slowly converted to coal  as coal contains mainly carbon  the conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonization       the wide  shallow seas of the carboniferous period provided ideal conditions for coal formation  although coal is known from most geological periods  the exception is the coal gap in the permian triassic extinction event  where coal is rare  coal is known from precambrian strata  which predate land plants   this coal is presumed to have originated from residues of algae         as geological processes apply pressure to dead biotic material over time  under suitable conditions  its metamorphic grade increases successively into     the classification of coal is generally based on the content of volatiles  however  the exact classification varies between countries  according to the german classification  coal is classified as follows       the middle six grades in the table represent a progressive transition from the english language sub bituminous to bituminous coal  while the last class is an approximate equivalent to anthracite  but more inclusive  us anthracite has      volatiles      cannel coal  sometimes called  candle coal   is a variety of fine grained  high rank coal with significant hydrogen content  it consists primarily of  exinite  macerals  now termed  liptinite      hilt s law is a geological term that states that  in a small area  the deeper the coal  the higher its rank  grade   the law holds true if the thermal gradient is entirely vertical  but metamorphism may cause lateral changes of rank  irrespective of depth     coal from the fushun mine in northeastern china was used to smelt copper as early as      bce    marco polo  the italian who traveled to china in the   th century  described coal as  black stonesxa     which burn like logs   and said coal was so plentiful  people could take three hot baths a week    in europe  the earliest reference to the use of coal as fuel is from the geological treatise on stones  lap      by the greek scientist theophrastus  circa         bc          among the materials that are dug because they are useful  those known as anthrakes coals are made of earth  and  once set on fire  they burn like charcoal  they are found in liguriaxa     and in elis as one approaches olympia by the mountain road  and they are used by those who work in metals     outcrop coal was used in britain during the bronze age            bc   where it has been detected as forming part of the composition of funeral pyres      in roman britain  with the exception of two modern fields   the romans were exploiting coals in all the major coalfields in england and wales by the end of the second century ad     evidence of trade in coal  dated to about ad      has been found at the roman settlement at heronbridge  near chester  and in the fenlands of east anglia  where coal from the midlands was transported via the car dyke for use in drying grain    coal cinders have been found in the hearths of villas and roman forts  particularly in northumberland  dated to around ad      in the west of england  contemporary writers described the wonder of a permanent brazier of coal on the altar of minerva at aquae sulis  modern day bath   although in fact easily accessible surface coal from what became the somerset coalfield was in common use in quite lowly dwellings locally    evidence of coal s use for iron working in the city during the roman period has been found    in eschweiler  rhineland  deposits of bituminous coal were used by the romans for the smelting of iron ore       no evidence exists of the product being of great importance in britain before the high middle ages  after about ad         mineral coal came to be referred to as  seacoal  in the   th century  the wharf where the material arrived in london was known as seacoal lane  so identified in a charter of king henry iii granted in         initially  the name was given because much coal was found on the shore  having fallen from the exposed coal seams on cliffs above or washed out of underwater coal outcrops    but by the time of henry viii  it was understood to derive from the way it was carried to london by sea    in          coal from newcastle upon tyne was shipped to london for the smiths and lime burners building westminster abbey    seacoal lane and newcastle lane  where coal was unloaded at wharves along the river fleet  are still in existence     see industrial processes below for modern uses of the term      these easily accessible sources had largely become exhausted  or could not meet the growing demand  by the   th century  when underground extraction by shaft mining or adits was developed    the alternative name was  pitcoal   because it came from mines  it was  however  the development of the industrial revolution that led to the large scale use of coal  as the steam engine took over from the water wheel  in       five sixths of the world s coal was mined in britain  britain would have run out of suitable sites for watermills by the     s if coal had not been available as a source of energy    in       there were some         miners in britain    but by       this had shrunk to some       miners working in around    collieries       coal is primarily used as a solid fuel to produce electricity and heat through combustion  world coal consumption was about      billion tonnes in              billion short tons  and is expected to increase     to      billion tonnes       billion short tons  by         china produced      billion tonnes       billion short tons  in       india produced about     million tonnes        million short tons  in             of china s electricity comes from coal  the usa consumed about     of the world total in       i e      million tonnes       billion short tons   using     of it for generation of electricity        of total power generated in the usa was done using coal       when coal is used for electricity generation  it is usually pulverized and then combusted  burned  in a furnace with a boiler    the furnace heat converts boiler water to steam  which is then used to spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity    the thermodynamic efficiency of this process has been improved over time  some older coal fired power stations have thermal efficiencies in the vicinity of       whereas the newest supercritical and  ultra supercritical  steam cycle turbines  operating at temperatures over    xa  c and pressures over    mpa  over      psi   can practically achieve thermal efficiencies in excess of      lhv basis  using anthracite fuel      or around      lhv basis  even when using lower grade lignite fuel    further thermal efficiency improvements are also achievable by improved pre drying  especially relevant with high moisture fuel such as lignite or biomass  and cooling technologies       an alternative approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle  igcc  power plant  instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam generating boiler  the coal can be first gasified  see coal gasification  to create syngas  which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity  just like natural gas is burned in a turbine   hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a heat recovery steam generator which powers a supplemental steam turbine  thermal efficiencies of current igcc power plants range from           hhv basis  or          lhv basis  for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies  shell  ge gasifier  cb i   igcc power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions  and allow for relatively easy carbon capture     at least     of the world s electricity comes from coal      and in       about one third of the united states  electricity came from coal  down from approximately     in           as of      in the united states  use of coal to generate electricity was declining  as plentiful supplies of natural gas obtained by hydraulic fracturing of tight shale formations became available at low prices       in denmark  a net electric efficiency of       has been obtained at the coal fired nordjyllandsv rket chp plant and an overall plant efficiency of up to     with cogeneration of electricity and district heating    the multifuel fired aved rev rket chp plant just outside copenhagen can achieve a net electric efficiency as high as      the overall plant efficiency with cogeneration of electricity and district heating can reach as much as           an alternative form of coal combustion is as coal water slurry fuel  cws   which was developed in the soviet union  cws significantly reduces emissions  improving the heating value of coal citation needed other ways to use coal are combined heat and power cogeneration and an mhd topping cycle     the total known deposits recoverable by current technologies  including highly polluting  low energy content types of coal  i e   lignite  bituminous   is sufficient for many years quantify however  consumption is increasing and maximal production could be reached within decades  see world coal reserves  below   on the other hand much may have to be left in the ground to avoid climate change         coke is a solid carbonaceous residue derived from low ash  low sulfur bituminous coal from which the volatile constituents are driven off by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as      xa  c       xa  f   so the fixed carbon and residual ash are fused together  metallurgical coke is used as a fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace    the result is pig iron  and is too rich in dissolved carbon  so it must be treated further to make steel  the coking coal should be low in sulfur and phosphorus  so they do not migrate to the metal     the coke must be strong enough to resist the weight of overburden in the blast furnace  which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route  however  the alternative route is direct reduced iron  where any carbonaceous fuel can be used to make sponge or pelletised iron  coke from coal is grey  hard  and porous and has a heating value of      million btu ton       mj kg   some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts  including coal tar  ammonia  light oils  and coal gas     petroleum coke is the solid residue obtained in oil refining  which resembles coke  but contains too many impurities to be useful in metallurgical applications     coal gasification can be used to produce syngas  a mixture of carbon monoxide  co  and hydrogen  h   gas  often syngas is used to fire gas turbines to produce electricity  but the versatility of syngas also allows it to be converted into transportation fuels  such as gasoline and diesel  through the fischer tropsch process  alternatively  syngas can be converted into methanol  which can be blended into fuel directly or converted to gasoline via the methanol to gasoline process    gasification combined with fischer tropsch technology is currently used by the sasol chemical company of south africa to make motor vehicle fuels from coal and natural gas  alternatively  the hydrogen obtained from gasification can be used for various purposes  such as powering a hydrogen economy  making ammonia  or upgrading fossil fuels     during gasification  the coal is mixed with oxygen and steam while also being heated and pressurized  during the reaction  oxygen and water molecules oxidize the coal into carbon monoxide  co   while also releasing hydrogen gas  h    this process has been conducted in both underground coal mines and in the production of town gas     if the refiner wants to produce gasoline  the syngas is collected at this state and routed into a fischer tropsch reaction  if hydrogen is the desired end product  however  the syngas is fed into the water gas shift reaction  where more hydrogen is liberated     in the past  coal was converted to make coal gas  town gas   which was piped to customers to burn for illumination  heating  and cooking     coal can also be converted into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by several different direct processes  which do not intrinsically require gasification or indirect conversion     in the direct liquefaction processes  the coal is either hydrogenated or carbonized  hydrogenation processes are the bergius process    the src i and src ii  solvent refined coal  processes  the nus corporation hydrogenation process     and several other single stage and two stage processes    in the process of low temperature carbonization  coal is coked at temperatures between     and    xa  c      and      xa  f   these temperatures optimize the production of coal tars richer in lighter hydrocarbons than normal coal tar  the coal tar is then further processed into fuels  an overview of coal liquefaction and its future potential is available       coal liquefaction methods involve carbon dioxide  co   emissions in the conversion process  if coal liquefaction is done without employing either carbon capture and storage  ccs  technologies or biomass blending  the result is lifecycle greenhouse gas footprints that are generally greater than those released in the extraction and refinement of liquid fuel production from crude oil  if ccs technologies are employed  reductions of       can be achieved in coal to liquid  ctl  plants and up to a     reduction is achievable when co gasifying coal with commercially demonstrated levels of biomass      biomass by weight  in coal biomass to liquids plants    for future synthetic fuel projects  carbon dioxide sequestration is proposed to avoid releasing co  into the atmosphere  sequestration adds to the cost of production     refined coal is the product of a coal upgrading technology that removes moisture and certain pollutants from lower rank coals such as sub bituminous and lignite  brown  coals  it is one form of several precombustion treatments and processes for coal that alter coal s characteristics before it is burned  the goals of precombustion coal technologies are to increase efficiency and reduce emissions when the coal is burned  depending on the situation  precombustion technology can be used in place of or as a supplement to postcombustion technologies to control emissions from coal fueled boilers     finely ground bituminous coal  known in this application as sea coal  is a constituent of foundry sand  while the molten metal is in the mould  the coal burns slowly  releasing reducing gases at pressure  and so preventing the metal from penetrating the pores of the sand  it is also contained in  mould wash   a paste or liquid with the same function applied to the mould before casting    sea coal can be mixed with the clay lining  the  bod   used for the bottom of a cupola furnace  when heated  the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable  easing the process of breaking open holes for tapping the molten metal       coal is an important feedstock in production of a wide range of chemical fertilizers and other chemical products  the main route to these products is coal gasification to produce syngas  primary chemicals that are produced directly from the syngas include methanol  hydrogen and carbon monoxide  which are the chemical building blocks from which a whole spectrum of derivative chemicals are manufactured  including olefins  acetic acid  formaldehyde  ammonia  urea and others  the versatility of syngas as a precursor to primary chemicals and high value derivative products provides the option of using relatively inexpensive coal to produce a wide range of valuable commodities     historically  production of chemicals from coal has been used since the     s and has become established in the market  according to the      worldwide gasification database    a survey of current and planned gasifiers  from      to      chemical production increased its gasification product share from     to      from      to           of new gasifier additions were to be for chemical production     because the slate of chemical products that can be made via coal gasification can in general also use feedstocks derived from natural gas and petroleum  the chemical industry tends to use whatever feedstocks are most cost effective  therefore  interest in using coal tends to increase for higher oil and natural gas prices and during periods of high global economic growth that may strain oil and gas production  also  production of chemicals from coal is of much higher interest in countries like south africa  china  india and the united states where there are abundant coal resources  the abundance of coal combined with lack of natural gas resources in china is strong inducement for the coal to chemicals industry pursued there  in the united states  the best example of the industry is eastman chemical company which has been successfully operating a coal to chemicals plant at its kingsport  tennessee  site since       similarly  sasol has built and operated coal to chemicals facilities in south africa     coal to chemical processes do require substantial quantities of water  as of      much of the coal to chemical production was in the people s republic of china     where environmental regulation and water management   was weak       coal is the official state mineral of kentucky    and the official state rock of utah    both u s  states have a historic link to coal mining     some cultures hold that children who misbehave will receive only a lump of coal from santa claus for christmas in their christmas stockings instead of presents     it is also customary and considered lucky in scotland and the north of england to give coal as a gift on new year s day  this occurs as part of first footing and represents warmth for the year to come     in north america  central appalachian coal futures contracts are currently traded on the new york mercantile exchange  trading symbol ql   the trading unit

especially in power stations  and of coal mining  including     the white rot fungus c  versicolor can grow on and metabolize naturally occurring coal    the bacteria diplococcus has been found to degrade coal  raising its temperature       coal  by liquefaction technology  is one of the backstop resources that could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil  this is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum  estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic u s  production of fuel from coal becomes cost competitive with oil priced at around     per barrel    with the     being the break even cost  with oil prices as low as around     per barrel in the u s  as of december       liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the u s   but will probably be re vitalized  similar to oil sand projects  with an oil price around     per barrel     in china  due to an increasing need for liquid energy in the transportation sector  coal liquefaction projects were given high priority even during periods of oil prices below     per barrel    this is probably because china prefers not to be dependent on foreign oil  instead utilizing its enormous domestic coal reserves  as oil prices were increasing during the first half of       the coal liquefaction projects in china were again boosted  and these projects are profitable with an oil barrel price of           china is the largest producer of coal in the world  it is the world s largest energy consumer  and relies on coal to supply     of its energy needs    an estimated   million people worked in china s coal mining industry

those burning underground can be difficult to locate and many cannot be extinguished  fires can cause the ground above to subside  their combustion gases are dangerous to life  and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires  coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire  lightning strikes are an important source of ignition  the coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen  air  can no longer reach the flame front  a grass fire in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire        coal fires in china
