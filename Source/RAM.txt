 in development    random access memory  ram  r m   is a form of computer data storage  a random access memory device allows data items to be read and written in roughly the same amount of time regardless of the order in which data items are accessed   in contrast  with other direct access data storage media such as hard disks  cd rws  dvd rws and the older drum memory  the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium  due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement delays     today  random access memory takes the form of integrated circuits  ram is normally associated with volatile types of memory  such as dram memory modules   where stored information is lost if power is removed  although many efforts have been made to develop non volatile ram chips   other types of non volatile memory exist that allow random access for read operations  but either do not allow write operations or have limitations on them  these include most types of rom and a type of flash memory called nor flash     integrated circuit ram chips came into the market in the late     s  with the first commercially available dram chip  the intel       introduced in october                   early computers used relays  mechanical counters  or delay lines for main memory functions  ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data in the order it was written  drum memory could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed  latches built out of vacuum tube triodes  and later  out of discrete transistors  were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers  such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data  generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided     the first practical form of random access memory was the williams tube starting in       it stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a cathode ray tube  since the electron beam of the crt could read and write the spots on the tube in any order  memory was random access  the capacity of the williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits  but it was much smaller  faster  and more power efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches  developed at the university of manchester in england  the williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored memory program was implemented in the manchester small scale experimental machine  ssem  computer  which first successfully ran a program on    june        in fact  rather than the williams tube memory being designed for the ssem  the ssem was a testbed to demonstrate the reliability of the memory       magnetic core memory was invented in      and developed up until the mid     s  it became a widespread form of random access memory  relying on an array of magnetized rings  by changing the sense of each ring s magnetization  data could be stored with one bit stored per ring  since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it  access to any memory location in any sequence was possible     magnetic core memory was the standard form of memory system until displaced by solid state memory in integrated circuits  starting in the early     s  robert h  dennard invented dynamic random access memory  dram  in       this allowed replacement of a   or   transistor latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit  greatly increasing memory density at the cost of volatility  data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor  and had to be periodically refreshed every few milliseconds before the charge could leak away     prior to the development of integrated read only memory  rom  circuits  permanent  or read only  random access memory was often constructed using diode matrices driven by address decoders  or specially wound core rope memory planes     the two main forms of modern ram are static ram  sram  and dynamic ram  dram   in sram  a bit of data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell  this form of ram is more expensive to produce  but is generally faster and requires less power than dram and  in modern computers  is often used as cache memory for the cpu  dram stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair  which together comprise a dram memory cell  the capacitor holds a high or low charge    or    respectively   and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor s state of charge or change it  as this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static ram  it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers     both static and dynamic ram are considered volatile  as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system  by contrast  read only memory  rom  stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors  such that the memory cannot be altered  writeable variants of rom  such as eeprom and flash memory  share properties of both rom and ram  enabling data to persist without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment  these persistent forms of semiconductor rom include usb flash drives  memory cards for cameras and portable devices  etc  ecc memory  which can be either sram or dram  includes special circuitry to detect and or correct random faults  memory errors  in the stored data  using parity bits or error correction code     in general  the term ram refers solely to solid state memory devices  either dram or sram   and more specifically the main memory in most computers  in optical storage  the term dvd ram is somewhat of a misnomer since  unlike cd rw or dvd rw it does not need to be erased before reuse  nevertheless a dvd ram behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower     one can read and over write data in ram  many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting of cpu registers  on die sram caches  external caches  dram  paging systems and virtual memory or swap space on a hard drive  this entire pool of memory may be referred to as  ram  by many developers  even though the various subsystems can have very different access times  violating the original concept behind the random access term in ram  even within a hierarchy level such as dram  the specific row  column  bank  rank  channel  or interleave organization of the components make the access time variable  although not to the extent that rotating storage media or a tape is variable  the overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the higher possible average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system  generally  the memory hierarchy follows the access time with the fast cpu registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the bottom      in many modern personal computers  the ram comes in an easily upgraded form of modules called memory modules or dram modules about the size of a few sticks of chewing gum  these can quickly be replaced should they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity  as suggested above  smaller amounts of ram  mostly sram  are also integrated in the cpu and other ics on the motherboard  as well as in hard drives  cd roms  and several other parts of the computer system     in addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications  ram is used in numerous other ways     most modern operating systems employ a method of extending ram capacity  known as  virtual memory   a portion of the computer s hard drive is set aside for a paging file or a scratch partition  and the combination of physical ram and the paging file form the system s total memory   for example  if a computer has   gb of ram and a   gb page file  the operating system has   gb total memory available to it   when the system runs low on physical memory  it can  swap  portions of ram to the paging file to make room for new data  as well as to read previously swapped information back into ram  excessive use of this mechanism results in thrashing and generally hampers overall system performance  mainly because hard drives are far slower than ram     software can  partition  a portion of a computer s ram  allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a ram disk  a ram disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down  unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source     sometimes  the contents of a relatively slow rom chip are copied to read write memory to allow for shorter access times  the rom chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses  often write protected   this process  sometimes called shadowing  is fairly common in both computers and embedded systems     as a common example  the bios in typical personal computers often has an option called  use shadow bios  or similar  when enabled  functions relying on data from the bios s rom will instead use dram locations  most can also toggle shadowing of video card rom or other rom sections   depending on the system  this may not result in increased performance  and may cause incompatibilities  for example  some hardware may be inaccessible to the operating system if shadow ram is used  on some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the bios is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access  free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed roms      several new types of non volatile ram  which will preserve data while powered down  are under development  the technologies used include carbon nanotubes and approaches utilizing the magnetic tunnel effect  amongst the  st generation mram  a     kib     xa  xa     bytes  magnetic ram  mram  chip was manufactured with     xa  m technology in the summer of       in june       infineon technologies unveiled a   xa mib    xa  xa     bytes  prototype again based on     xa  m technology  there are two  nd generation techniques currently in development  thermal assisted switching  tas   which is being developed by crocus technology  and spin torque transfer  stt  on which crocus  hynix  ibm  and several other companies are working    nantero built a functioning carbon nanotube memory prototype   xa gib    xa  xa     bytes  array in       whether some of these technologies will be able to eventually take a significant market share from either dram  sram  or flash memory technology  however  remains to be seen     since        solid state drives   based on flash memory  with capacities exceeding     gigabytes and performance far exceeding traditional disks have become available  this development has started to blur the definition between traditional random access memory and  disks   dramatically reducing the difference in performance     some kinds of random access memory  such as  ecoram   are specifically designed for server farms  where low power consumption is more important than speed       the  memory wall  is the growing disparity of speed between cpu and memory outside the cpu chip  an important reason for this disparity is the limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries  from      to       cpu speed improved at an annual rate of     while memory speed only improved at      given these trends  it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelming bottleneck in computer performance       cpu speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because current cpu designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense  intel summarized these causes in a      document        first of all  as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise  the transistor leakage current increases  leading to excess power consumption and heat    secondly  the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency  since memory access times have not been able to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies  third  for certain applications  traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster  due to the so called von neumann bottleneck   further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy  in addition  partly due to limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices  resistance capacitance  rc  delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink  imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don t address      the rc delays in signal transmission were also noted in clock rate versus ipc  the end of the road for conventional microarchitectures which projects a maximum of       average annual cpu performance improvement between      and          a different concept is the processor memory performance gap  which can be addressed by  d computer chips that reduce the distance between the logic and memory aspects that are further apart in a  d chip    memory subsystem design requires a focus on the gap  which is widening over time    the main method of bridging the gap is the use of caches  small amounts of high speed memory that houses recent operations and instructions nearby the processor  speeding up the execution of those operations or instructions in cases where they are called upon frequently  multiple levels of caching have been developed in order to deal with the widening of the gap  and the performance of high speed modern computers are reliant on evolving caching techniques    these can prevent the loss of performance that the processor has  as it takes less time to perform the computation it has been initiated to complete    there can be up to a     difference between the growth in speed of processor speeds and the lagging speed of main memory access
