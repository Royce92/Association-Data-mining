vaduz  and has been identified as a tax haven  it is a member of the european free trade association and part of the european economic area and the schengen area  but not of the european union             the oldest traces of hominid existence in liechtenstein date back to the middle paleolithic era   neolithic farming settlements were founded in the valleys around      bc     hallstatt and la t ne cultures flourished during the late iron age from around     bc possibly under some influence from the greek and etruscan civilisations  one of the most important tribal groups in the alpine region were the helvetii  in    bc  at the battle of bibracte  julius caesar defeated the alpine tribes  bringing the region under closer control of the roman empire  by    bc tiberius  who was destined to be the second roman emperor  and his brother drusus conquered the entire alpine area  liechtenstein was integrated into the roman province of raetia  the area was maintained by the roman military  which maintained a large legionary camp called brigantium  austria  near lake constance and at magia  swiss   a roman road ran through the territory  in        brigantium was destroyed by the alemanni  a germanic people who settled in the area in around         in the early middle ages  the alemanni had settled the eastern swiss plateau by the  th century and the valleys of the alps by the end of the  th century  liechtenstein formed part of eastern edge of alemannia  the entire region became part of frankish empire in the  th century following clovis i s victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in             liechtenstein remained under frankish hegemony  merovingian and carolingian dynasties  until the empire was divided by the treaty of verdun in    xa ad following the death of charlemagne   the territory of present day liechtenstein belonged to east francia until it was reunified with middle francia under the holy roman empire around     xa ad      by       dominions across the alpine plateau were controlled by the houses of savoy  z hringer  habsburg  and kyburg  other regions were accorded the imperial immediacy that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes  when the kyburg dynasty fell in       the habsburgs under king rudolph i  holy roman emperor in       extended their territory to the eastern alpine plateau that included the territory of liechtenstein    this region was enfeoffed to the counts of hohenems prior to the creation of the liechtenstein dynasty     the family  from which the principality takes its name  originally came from castle liechtenstein in lower austria which they had possessed from at least      until the   th century  and again from      onwards   the liechtensteins acquired land  predominantly in moravia  lower austria  silesia  and styria  as these territories were all held in feudal tenure from more senior feudal lords  particularly various branches of the habsburgs  the liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the imperial diet  parliament   the reichstag  even though several liechtenstein princes served several habsburg rulers as close advisers  without any territory held directly from the imperial throne  they held little power in the holy roman empire     for this reason  the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as unmittelbar   unintermediated    or held without any intermediate feudal tenure  directly from the holy roman emperor  during the early   th century karl i of liechtenstein was made a f rst  prince  by the holy roman emperor matthias after siding with him in a political battle  hans adam i was allowed to purchase the minuscule herrschaft   lordship   of schellenberg and county of vaduz  in      and      respectively  from the hohenems  tiny schellenberg and vaduz had exactly the political status required  no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain emperor     on    january       after the lands had been purchased  charles vi  holy roman emperor  decreed that vaduz and schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of f rstentum  principality  with the name  liechtenstein  in honour of  his true servant  anton florian of liechtenstein   it was on this date that liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the holy roman empire  it is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchase that the princes of liechtenstein never visited their new principality for almost     years     by the early   th century  as a result of the napoleonic wars in europe  the holy roman empire came under the effective control of france  following the crushing defeat at austerlitz by napoleon in       emperor francis ii abdicated  ending more than     years of feudal government  napoleon reorganized much of the empire into the confederation of the rhine  this political restructuring had broad consequences for liechtenstein  the historical imperial  legal and political institutions had been dissolved  the state ceased to owe obligations to any feudal lord beyond its borders     modern publications generally attribute liechtenstein s sovereignty to these events  its prince ceased to owe obligations to any suzerain  from    july      when the confederation of the rhine was founded  the prince of liechtenstein was a member  in fact a vassal of its hegemon  styled protector  the french emperor napoleon i  until the dissolution of the confederation on    october          soon afterward  liechtenstein joined the german confederation     june     xa      august       which was presided over by the emperor of austria     in       prince johann i granted the territory a limited constitution  it was in the same year that prince aloys became the first member of the house of liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name  the next visit would not occur until          developments during the   th century included     until the end of world war i  liechtenstein was closely tied first to the austrian empire and later to austria hungary  the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the habsburg territories  and they spent much of their time at their two palaces in vienna  the economic devastation caused by this war forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour  switzerland     at the time of the dissolution of the austro hungarian empire  it was argued that liechtenstein  as a fief of the holy roman empire  was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of austria  since the latter did not consider itself as the legal successor to the empire  this is partly contradicted by the liechtenstein perception that the dethroned austro hungarian emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the holy roman empire     in          year old prince franz i succeeded to the throne  franz had just married elisabeth von gutmann  a wealthy woman from vienna  although liechtenstein had no official nazi party  a nazi sympathy movement arose within its national union party  local liechtenstein nazis identified elisabeth as their jewish  problem        in march       just after the annexation of austria by nazi germany  prince franz named as regent his    year old first cousin twice removed and heir presumptive  prince franz joseph  franz died in july that year  and franz joseph succeeded to the throne     during world war ii  liechtenstein remained officially neutral  looking to neighboring switzerland for assistance and guidance  while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in bohemia  moravia  and silesia were taken to liechtenstein for safekeeping  at the close of the conflict  czechoslovakia and poland  acting to seize what they considered to be german possessions  expropriated the entirety of the liechtenstein dynasty s properties in those three regions  the expropriations  subject to modern legal dispute at the international court of justice  included over      xa km      xa sqxa mi  of agricultural and forest land  most notably unesco listed lednice valtice cultural landscape   and several family castles and palaces     liechtenstein gave asylum to about     soldiers of the first russian national army  a collaborationist russian force allied to the german wehrmacht  at the close of world war ii  about     of the group somewhat voluntarily agreed to return to the ussr  they departed in a train to vienna and nothing was ever heard of them again  the remainder stayed in liechtenstein for another year  resisting  with support from liechtenstein  further pressure by the soviet government to participate in the repatriation programme   in contrast  due to agreements made during the yalta conference  the western allies repatriated soviet citizens   eventually the government of argentina offered asylum and about a hundred people left  this is commemorated by a monument at the border town of hinterschellenberg  it is also the theme of the french television documentary le dernier secret de yalta  yalta s last secret  by nicolas jallot     citizens of liechtenstein were forbidden to enter czechoslovakia during the cold war  more recently the diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial post war bene  decrees resulted in liechtenstein not sharing international relations with the czech republic or slovakia  diplomatic relations were established between liechtenstein and the czech republic on    july             and with slovakia on   december            liechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of the war in europe  the liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures  including the portrait  ginevra de  benci  by leonardo da vinci  which was purchased by the national gallery of art of the united states in      for    million      million in      dollars   then a record price for a painting     however  by the late     s it used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies to the country  becoming one of the

established liechtenstein as a constitutional monarchy headed by the reigning prince of the princely house of liechtenstein  a parliamentary system had been established  although the reigning prince

parliament may be subject to a referendum       executive authority is vested in a collegiate government comprising the head of government  prime minister  and four government councilors  ministers

on women s suffrage  in which only men were allowed to participate  passed with       in favor       in a national referendum in march       nearly two thirds of the electorate voted in support of hans adam ii s proposed new constitution to replace the      one  the proposed constitution was criticised by many  including the council of europe  as expanding the powers of the monarchy  continuing the power to veto any law  and allowing the prince to dismiss the government or any minister   the prince threatened that if the constitution failed  he would  among other things  convert some of the royal property for commercial use and move to austria    the princely family and the prince enjoy tremendous public support inside the nation  and the resolution passed with about     in favour    a proposal to revoke the prince s veto powers was rejected by     of voters in a      referendum       few national constitutions provide a right of secession  but municipalities in liechtenstein are
