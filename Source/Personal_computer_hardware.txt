 computer hardware  usually simply called hardware when a computing context is implicit  is the collection of physical elements that constitutes a computer system  computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer  such as the monitor  mouse  keyboard  computer data storage  hard disk drive  hdd   system unit  graphic cards  sound cards  memory  motherboard and chips   and so on  all of which are physical objects that can be touched  that is  they are tangible    in contrast  software is instructions that can be stored and run by hardware     software is any set of machine readable instructions that directs a computer s processor to perform specific operations  a combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system              the template for all modern computers is the von neumann architecture  detailed in a      paper by hungarian mathematician john von neumann  this describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with subdivisions of a processing unit consisting of an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers  a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter  a memory to store both data and instructions  external mass storage  and input and output mechanisms   the meaning of the term has evolved to mean a stored program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus  this is referred to as the von neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system      for the third consecutive year  u s  business to business channel sales  sales through distributors and commercial resellers  increased  ending      up nearly   percent at       billion  the impressive growth was the fastest sales increase since the end of the recession  sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year peaking in fourth quarter with a     percent increase over the fourth quarter of           there are a number of different types of computer system in use today     the personal computer  also known as the pc  is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price  laptops are generally very similar  although may use lower power or reduced size components     the computer case is a plastic or metal enclosure that houses most of the components  those found on desktop computers are usually small enough to fit under a desk  however in recent years more compact designs have become more common place  such as the all in one style designs from apple  namely the imac  laptops are computers that usually come in a clamshell form factor  again however in more recent years deviations from this form factor have started to emerge such as laptops that have a detachable screen that become tablet computers in their own right     a power supply unit  psu  converts alternating current  ac  electric power to low voltage dc power for the internal components of the computer  laptops are capable of running from a built in battery  normally for a period of hours      the motherboard is the main component of computer  it is a large rectangular board with integrated circuitry that connects the other parts of the computer including the cpu  the ram  the disk drives cd  dvd  hard disk  or any others  as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the expansion slots     components directly attached to or part of the motherboard include     an expansion card in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus     computer data storage  often called storage or memory  refers to computer components and recording media that retain digital data  data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers     fixed media    data is stored by a computer using a variety of media  hard disk drives are found in virtually all older computers  due to their high capacity and low cost  but solid state drives are faster and more power efficient  although currently more expensive than hard drives  so are often found in more expensive computers  some systems may use a disk array controller for greater performance or reliability     removable media    to transfer data between computers  a usb flash drive or optical disc may be used  their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems  the majority of machines have an optical disk drive  and virtually all have a usb port     input and output devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis  the following are either standard or very common to many computer systems     input    input devices allow the user to enter information into the system  or control its operation  most personal computers have a mouse and keyboard  but laptop systems typically use a touchpad instead of a mouse  other input devices include webcams  microphones  joysticks  and image scanners     output device    output devices display information in a human readable form  such devices could include printers  speakers  monitors or a braille embosser     a mainframe computer is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer  they are designed to perform large numbers of calculations for governments and large enterprises     in the     s and     s more and more departments started to use cheaper and dedicated systems for specific purposes like process control and laboratory automation     a supercomputer is superficially similar to a mainframe  but is instead intended for extremely demanding computational tasks  as of november     update  the fastest supercomputer in the world is the tianhe    in guangzhou  china      the term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology  rather it indicates the fastest computers available at any given time  in mid       the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop  or      trillion floating point operations per second  super computers are fast but extremely costly so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets  super computers typically run military and scientific applications  although they cost millions of dollars  they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed  for example  large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies  and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to our country
