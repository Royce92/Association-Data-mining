     as an  association not for profit  under the companies acts      to       in which the liability of its members was limited by guarantee  it was later incorporated by six separate acts of parliament  the national trust acts             as varied by a parliamentary scheme implemented by the charities  national trust  order         it is also a charitable organisation registered under

eliot and the kyrle society     in the early days the trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings  its first property was alfriston clergy house  a cornice carving which may have given the trust its sprig of oak symbol citation needed the trust s first nature reserve was wicken fen  while its first archaeological monument was white barrow     the trust has been the beneficiary of numerous donations of both property and money  from      to      the trust s chairman was john bailey  of whom the times said in        the strong position which the national trust now occupies is largely due to him  and it will perhaps never be known how many generous gifts of rural beauty and historic interest the nation owes  directly or indirectly  to his persuasive enthusiasm    at the same a group of anonymous philanthropists set up ferguson s gang  their masked appearances with sacks of money and use of unusual pseudonyms such as bill stickers and red biddy caught the public s attention around the increasing danger of urbanisation      the focus on country houses and gardens which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties came about in the mid   th century when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them  many were donated to the trust in lieu of death duties  the diarist james lees milne is usually credited with playing a central role in the main phase of the trust s country house acquisition programme  though he was in fact simply an employee of the trust  and was carrying through policies which had already been decided by its governing body      one of the biggest crises in the trust s history erupted at the      annual general meeting  when the leadership of the trust was accused of being out of touch and placing too much emphasis on conserving country houses  in response  the council asked sir henry benson to chair an advisory committee to review the structure of the trust  following the publication of the benson report in      much of the administration of the trust was devolved to the regions citation needed    in the     s a dispute over whether stag  or deer hunting should be permitted on national trust land caused bitter disputes within the organisation and was the subject of much debate at annual general meetings  but it did little to slow down the growth in member numbers     in      the trust moved to a new head office in swindon  wiltshire  the building was constructed on an abandoned railway yard  and is intended as a model of brownfield renewal  it is named heelis  taken from the married name of children s author beatrix potter  a huge supporter and donor to the trust  which now owns the land she formerly owned in cumbria      the trust is an independent charity rather than a government institution  english heritage and its equivalents in other parts of the united kingdom are government bodies which perform some functions which overlap with the work of the national trust      it was founded as a not for profit company in      but was later re incorporated by a private act of parliament  the national trust act       subsequent acts of parliament between      and      amended and extended the trust s powers and remit  in      the governance of the trust was substantially changed under a scheme made by the charity commission      the trust is governed by a twelve strong board of trustees  appointed and overseen by a council of    people elected by the members of the trust  and    people appointed by other organisations whose work is related to that of the trust  such as the soil association  the royal horticultural society  and the council for british archaeology      at an operational level the trust is organised into regions which are aligned with the official local government regions  its headquarters are in swindon     for the year ended    february       the trust s total income was      million  up from      million in       the largest sources of income were still membership subscriptions         million   direct property income         million  and legacies

half of the council of the national trust  and periodically  most recently in       vote on the organisations which may appoint the other half of the council    members may also propose and vote on motions at the annual general meeting  although these are advisory and do not decide the policy of the trust     the trust is heavily supported by volunteers  who  as of       numbered approximately         contributing      million hours of work with an estimated value of       million   volunteering experiences are wide and varied  ranging from helping in its historic houses and gardens  to fundraising and providing specialist skills    the trust is a member of ncvys in recognition of its work for the personal and social development of young people       the trust owns two hundred historic houses that are open to the public  the majority of them are country houses and most of the others are associated with famous individuals  the majority of these country houses contain collections of pictures  furniture  books  metalwork  ceramics and textiles that have remained in their historic context  most of the houses also have important gardens attached to them  and the trust also owns some important gardens not attached to a house  the properties include some of the most famous stately homes in the country and some of the key gardens in the history of british gardening     the trust acquired the majority of its country houses in the mid   th century  when death duties were at their most punitive  james lees milne was secretary of the trust s country house committee in the key period either side of world war ii  the arrangements made with families bequeathing their homes to the trust often allowed them to continue to live in part of the property   since the     s the trust has been reluctant to take over large houses without substantial accompanying endowment funds  and its acquisitions in this category have been less frequent      in recent years the trust has sought to broaden its activities and appeal by acquiring historic properties such as former mills  early factories   workhouses and paul mccartney and john lennon s childhood homes      since its founding in       the trust has gradually expanded its collection of art  mostly through whole property acquisitions  since      there has been a curator of pictures and sculpture    the first was st john  bobby  gore  who was appointed  adviser on paintings  in       he published catalogues of the pictures at upton  polesden lacey  buscot  saltram and ascott    his successor in      was alastair laing  who cared for the works of art at     properties and created the exhibition in trust for the nation  held at the national gallery in            since      the curator has been david taylor  who has approved photos of the trust s        oil paintings to be included in the public catalogue foundation s searchable online archive of oil paintings  available since         use of the publicly available website was probably instrumental in the discovery of rembrandt s self portrait wearing a white feathered bonnet   which is now displayed at buckland abbey near yelverton in devon     this discovery is the second rembrandt to have found its way into the collection  the first was the portrait of catrina hooghsaet at penrhyn castle  which was added to the collection after the rijksmuseum

xa km    mostly of countryside  and covering nearly      of the total land mass of england  wales and northern ireland    a large proportion of this consists of the parks and agricultural estates attached to country houses  but there are also many countryside properties which were acquired specifically for their scenic or scientific value  the trust owns or has covenant over about a quarter of the lake district    it has similar control over about     of the peak district national park  see for example south peak estate  high peak estate     it owns or protects roughly one fifth of the coast in england  wales and northern ireland     xa miles      xa km   and has a long term campaign  project neptune  which seeks to acquire more       the national trust acts grant the trust the unique statutory power to declare land inalienable  this prevents the land from being sold or mortgaged against the trust s wishes without special parliamentary procedure  the inalienability of trust land was over ridden by parliament in the case of proposals to construct a section of the plympton by pass through the park at saltram  on the grounds that the road proposal had been known about before the park at saltram was declared inalienable       the acts also give the trust the power to make bylaws to regulate the activities of people when on its land  all photography at national trust properties  other than that for private and personal use or for entry into approved competitions  is strictly prohibited      except for social networking sites such as flickr    visitors are instead
