 mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics  by convention  the applied methods refer to those beyond simple geometry  such as differential and integral calculus  difference and differential equations  matrix algebra  mathematical programming  and other computational methods    an advantage claimed for the approach is its allowing formulation of theoretical relationships with rigor  generality  and simplicity      it is argued that mathematics allows economists to form meaningful  testable propositions about wide ranging and complex subjects which could less easily be expressed informally  further  the language of mathematics allows economists to make specific  positive claims about controversial or contentious subjects that would be impossible without mathematics   much of economic theory is currently presented in terms of mathematical economic models  a set of stylized and simplified mathematical relationships asserted to clarify assumptions and implications      broad applications include     formal economic modeling began in the   th century with the use of differential calculus to represent and explain economic behavior  such as utility maximization  an early economic application of mathematical optimization  economics became more mathematical as a discipline throughout the first half of the   th century  but introduction of new and generalized techniques in the period around the second world war  as in game theory  would greatly broaden the use of mathematical formulations in economics       this rapid systematizing of economics alarmed critics of the discipline as well as some noted economists  john maynard keynes  robert heilbroner  friedrich hayek and others have criticized the broad use of mathematical models for human behavior  arguing that some human choices are irreducible to mathematics             the use of mathematics in the service of social and economic analysis dates back to the   th century  then  mainly in german universities  a style of instruction emerged which dealt specifically with detailed presentation of data as it related to public administration  gottfried achenwall lectured in this fashion  coining the term statistics  at the same time  a small group of professors in england established a method of  reasoning by figures upon things relating to government  and referred to this practice as political arithmetick   sir william petty wrote at length on issues that would later concern economists  such as taxation  velocity of money and national income  but while his analysis was numerical  he rejected abstract mathematical methodology  petty s use of detailed numerical data  along with john graunt  would influence statisticians and economists for some time  even though petty s works were largely ignored by english scholars       the mathematization of economics began in earnest in the   th century  most of the economic analysis of the time was what would later be called classical economics  subjects were discussed and dispensed with through algebraic means  but calculus was not used  more importantly  until johann heinrich von th nen s the isolated state in       economists did not develop explicit and abstract models for behavior in order to apply the tools of mathematics  th nen s model of farmland use represents the first example of marginal analysis    th nen s work was largely theoretical  but he also mined empirical data in order to attempt to support his generalizations  in comparison to his contemporaries  th nen built economic models and tools  rather than applying previous tools to new problems       meanwhile a new cohort of scholars trained in the mathematical methods of the physical sciences gravitated to economics  advocating and applying those methods to their subject    and described today as moving from geometry to mechanics    these included w s  jevons who presented paper on a  general mathematical theory of political economy  in       providing an outline for use of the theory of marginal utility in political economy    in       he published the principles of political economy  declaring that the subject as science  must be mathematical simply because it deals with quantities   jevons expected the only collection of statistics for price and quantities would permit the subject as presented to become an exact science    others preceded and followed in expanding mathematical representations of economic problems     augustin cournot and l on walras built the tools of the discipline axiomatically around utility  arguing that individuals sought to maximize their utility across choices in a way that could be described mathematically    at the time  it was thought that utility was quantifiable  in units known as utils    cournot  walras and francis ysidro edgeworth are considered the precursors to modern mathematical economics       cournot  a professor of mathematics  developed a mathematical treatment in      for duopoly a market condition defined by competition between two sellers    this treatment of competition  first published in researches into the mathematical principles of wealth    is referred to as cournot duopoly  it is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost  further  it assumed that both goods were homogeneous  each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied  the profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit market price  differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations  the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity  price and profits    cournot s contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades  but eventually influenced many of the marginalists      cournot s models of duopoly and oligopoly also represent one of the first formulations of non cooperative games  today the solution can be given as a nash equilibrium but cournot s work preceded modern game theory by over     years       while cournot provided a solution for what would later be called partial equilibrium  l on walras attempted to formalize discussion of the economy as a whole through a theory of general competitive equilibrium  the behavior of every economic actor would be considered on both the production and consumption side  walras originally presented four separate models of exchange  each recursively included in the next  the solution of the resulting system of equations  both linear and non linear  is the general equilibrium    at the time  no general solution could be expressed for a system of arbitrarily many equations  but walras s attempts produced two famous results in economics  the first is walras  law and the second is the principle of t tonnement  walras  method was considered highly mathematical for the time and edgeworth commented at length about this fact in his review of  l ments d  conomie politique pure  elements of pure economics        walras  law was introduced as a theoretical answer to the problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium  his notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation  walras assumed that in equilibrium  all money would be spent on all goods  every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods  starting from this assumption  walras could then show that if there were n markets and n   markets cleared  reached equilibrium conditions  that the nth market would clear as well  this is easiest to visualize with two markets  considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money   if one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state  no additional goods  or conversely  money  can enter or exit the second market  so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well  walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level       t tonnement  roughly  french for groping toward  was meant to serve as the practical expression of walrasian general equilibrium  walras abstracted the marketplace as an auction of goods where the auctioneer would call out prices and market participants would wait until they could each satisfy their personal reservation prices for the quantity desired  remembering here that this is an auction on all goods  so everyone has a reservation price for their desired basket of goods        only when all buyers are satisfied with the given market price would transactions occur  the market would  clear  at that price no surplus or shortage would exist  the word t tonnement is used to describe the directions the market takes in groping toward equilibrium  settling high or low prices on different goods until a price is agreed upon for all goods  while the process appears dynamic  walras only presented a static model  as no transactions would occur until all markets were in equilibrium  in practice very few markets operate in this manner       edgeworth introduced mathematical elements to economics explicitly in mathematical psychics  an essay on the application of mathematics to the moral sciences  published in         he adopted jeremy bentham s felicific calculus to economic behavior  allowing the outcome of each decision to be converted into a change in utility    using this assumption  edgeworth built a model of exchange on three assumptions  individuals are self interested  individuals act to maximize utility  and individuals are  free to recontract with another independently of   any third party        given two individuals  the set of solutions where the both individuals can maximize utility is described by the contract curve on what is now known as an edgeworth box  technically  the construction of the two person solution to edgeworth s problem was not developed graphically until      by arthur lyon bowley    the contract curve of the edgeworth box  or more generally on any set of solutions to edgeworth s problem for more actors  is referred to as the core of an economy       edgeworth devoted considerable effort to insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all schools of thought in economics  while at the helm of the economic journal  he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers  including edwin robert anderson seligman  a noted skeptic of mathematical economics    the articles focused on a back and forth over tax incidence and responses by producers  edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand  such as first class and economy on an airplane  if the plane flies  both sets of seats fly with it  might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied  common sense and more traditional  numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous  seligman insisted that the results edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation  he suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions  harold hotelling later showed that edgeworth was correct and that the same result  a  diminution of price as a result of the tax   could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate       from the later     s  an array of new mathematical tools from the differential calculus and differential equations  convex sets  and graph theory were deployed to advance economic theory in a way similar to new mathematical methods earlier applied to physics     the process was later described as moving from mechanics to axiomatics       vilfredo pareto analyzed microeconomics by treating decisions by economic actors as attempts to change a given allotment of goods to another  more preferred allotment  sets of allocations could then be treated as pareto efficient  pareto optimal is an equivalent term  when no exchanges could occur between actors that could make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off    pareto s proof is commonly conflated with walrassian equilibrium or informally ascribed to adam smith s invisible hand hypothesis    rather  pareto s statement was the first formal assertion of what would be known as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics    these models lacked the inequalities of the next generation of mathematical economics     in the landmark treatise foundations of economic analysis         paul samuelson identified a common paradigm and mathematical structure across multiple fields in the subject  building on previous work by alfred marshall  foundations took mathematical concepts from physics and applied them to economic problems  this broad view  for example  comparing le chatelier s principle to t tonnement  drives the fundamental premise of mathematical economics  systems of economic actors may be modeled and their behavior described much like any other system  this extension followed on the work of the marginalists in the previous century and extended it significantly  samuelson approached the problems of applying individual utility maximization over aggregate groups with comparative statics  which compares two different equilibrium states after an exogenous change in a variable  this and other methods in the book provided the foundation for mathematical economics in the   th century        restricted models of general equilibrium were formulated by john von neumann in         unlike earlier versions  the models of von neumann had inequality constraints  for his model of an expanding economy  von neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of brouwer s fixed point theorem  von neumann s model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencilxa  a     b with nonnegative matricesxa a and b  von neumann sought probability vectorsxa p andxa q and a positive numberxa   that would solve the complementarity equation    along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency  in this model  the  transposed  probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the  intensity  at which the production process would run  the unique solution   represents the rate of growth of the economy  which equals the interest rate  proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements  even for von neumann        von neumann s results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming  where von neumann s model uses only nonnegative matrices    the study of von neumann s model of an expanding economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics           in       the russian born economist wassily leontief built his model of input output analysis from the  material balance  tables constructed by soviet economists  which themselves followed earlier work by the physiocrats  with his model  which described a system of production and demand processes  leontief described how changes in demand in one economic sector would influence production in another    in practice  leontief estimated the coefficients of his simple models  to address economically interesting questions  in production economics   leontief technologies  produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs  regardless of the price of inputs  reducing the value of leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily  in contrast  the von neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques  but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology         in mathematics  mathematical optimization  or optimization or mathematical programming  refers to the selection of a best element from some set of available alternatives    in the simplest case  an optimization problem involves maximizing or minimizing a real function by selecting input values of the function and computing the corresponding values of the function  the solution process includes satisfying general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality  for optimization problems  specialized notation may be used as to the function and its input s   more generally  optimization includes finding the best available element of some function given a defined domain and may use a variety of different computational optimization techniques       economics is closely enough linked to optimization by agents in an economy that an influential definition relatedly describes economics qua science as the  study of human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means  with alternative uses    optimization problems run through modern economics  many with explicit economic or technical constraints  in microeconomics  the utility maximization problem and its dual problem  the expenditure minimization problem for a given level of utility  are economic optimization problems    theory posits that consumers maximize their utility  subject to their budget constraints and that firms maximize their profits  subject to their production functions  input costs  and market demand       economic equilibrium is studied in optimization theory as a key ingredient of economic theorems that in principle could be tested against empirical data     newer developments have occurred in dynamic programming and modeling optimization with risk and uncertainty  including applications to portfolio theory  the economics of information  and search theory       optimality properties for an entire market system may be stated in mathematical terms  as in formulation of the two fundamental theorems of welfare economics   and in the arrow debreu model of general equilibrium  also discussed below     more concretely  many problems are amenable to analytical  formulaic  solution  many others may be sufficiently complex to require numerical methods of solution  aided by software    still others are complex but tractable enough to allow computable methods of solution  in particular computable general equilibrium models for the entire economy       linear and nonlinear programming have profoundly affected microeconomics  which had earlier considered only equality constraints    many of the mathematical economists who received nobel prizes in economics had conducted notable research using linear programming  leonid kantorovich  leonid hurwicz  tjalling koopmans  kenneth j  arrow  and robert dorfman  paul samuelson  and robert solow    both kantorovich and koopmans acknowledged that george b  dantzig deserved to share their nobel prize for linear programming  economists who conducted research in nonlinear programming also have won the nobel prize  notably ragnar frisch in addition to kantorovich  hurwicz  koopmans  arrow  and samuelson     linear programming was developed to aid the allocation of resources in firms and in industries during the     s in russia and during the     s in the united states  during the berlin airlift         linear programming was used to plan the shipment of supplies to prevent berlin from starving after the soviet blockade         extensions to nonlinear optimization with inequality constraints were achieved in      by albert w  tucker and harold kuhn  who considered the nonlinear optimization problem     in allowing inequality constraints  the kuhn tucker approach generalized the classic method of lagrange multipliers  which  until then  had allowed only equality constraints    the kuhn tucker approach inspired further research on lagrangian duality  including the treatment of inequality constraints      the duality theory of nonlinear programming is particularly satisfactory when applied to convex minimization problems  which enjoy the convex analytic duality theory of fenchel and rockafellar  this convex duality is particularly strong for polyhedral convex functions  such as those arising in linear programming  lagrangian duality and convex analysis are used daily in operations research  in the scheduling of power plants  the planning of production schedules for factories  and the routing of airlines  routes  flights  planes  crews        economic dynamics allows for changes in economic variables over time  including in dynamic systems  the problem of finding optimal functions for such changes is studied in variational calculus and in optimal control theory  before the second world war  frank ramsey and harold hotelling used the calculus of variations to that end     following richard bellman s work on dynamic programming and the      english translation of l  pontryagin et al  s earlier work    optimal control theory was used more extensively in economics in addressing dynamic problems  especially as to economic growth equilibrium and stability of economic systems    of which a textbook example is optimal consumption and saving    a crucial distinction is between deterministic and stochastic control models    other applications of optimal control theory include those in finance  inventories  and production for example       it was in the course of proving of the existence of an optimal equilibrium in his      model of economic growth that john von neumann introduced functional analytic methods to include topology in economic theory  in particular  fixed point theory through his generalization of brouwer s fixed point theorem       following von neumann s program  kenneth arrow and g rard debreu formulated abstract models of economic equilibria using convex sets and fixed point theory  in introducing the arrow debreu model in       they proved the existence  but not the uniqueness  of an equilibrium and also proved that every walras equilibrium is pareto efficient  in general  equilibria need not be unique    in their models  the   primal   vector space represented quantitites while the  dual  vector space represented prices       in russia  the mathematician leonid kantorovich developed economic models in partially ordered vector spaces  that emphasized the duality between quantities and prices    kantorovich renamed prices as  objectively determined valuations  which were abbreviated in russian as  o xa o xa o    alluding to the difficulty of discussing prices in the soviet union           even in finite dimensions  the concepts of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory  particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set  representing production or consumption possibilities  however  problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty require the use of infinite dimensional function spaces  because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes             john von neumann s work on functional analysis and topology in broke new ground in mathematics and economic theory      it also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus  in particular  general equilibrium theorists used general topology  convex geometry  and optimization theory more than differential calculus  because the approach of differential calculus had failed to establish the existence of an equilibrium     however  the decline of differential calculus should not be exaggerated  because differential calculus has always been used in graduate training and in applications  moreover  differential calculus has returned to the highest levels of mathematical economics  general equilibrium theory  get   as practiced by the  get set   the humorous designation due to jacques h  dr ze   in the     s and     s  however  g rard debreu and stephen smale led a revival of the use of differential calculus in mathematical economics  in particular  they were able to prove the existence of a general equilibrium  where earlier writers had failed  because of their novel mathematics  baire category from general topology and sard s lemma from differential topology  other economists associated with the use of differential analysis include egbert dierker  andreu mas colell  and yves balasko      these advances have changed the traditional narrative of the history of mathematical economics  following von neumann  which celebrated the abandonment of differential calculus     john von neumann  working with oskar morgenstern on the theory of games  broke new mathematical ground in      by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed point theory to economic analysis     their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus  for which the maximum operator did not apply to non differentiable functions  continuing von neumann s work in cooperative game theory  game theorists lloyd s  shapley  martin shubik  herv  moulin  nimrod megiddo  bezalel peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics  for example  research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public works projects  for example  cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of southern sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the usa     earlier neoclassical theory had bounded only the range of bargaining outcomes and in special cases  for example bilateral monopoly or along the contract curve of the edgeworth box    von neumann and morgenstern s results were similarly weak  following von neumann s program  however  john nash used fixed point theory to prove conditions under which the bargaining problem and noncooperative games can generate a unique equilibrium solution    noncooperative game theory has been adopted as a fundamental aspect of experimental economics    behavioral economics    information economics    industrial organization    and political economy    it has also given rise to the subject of mechanism design  sometimes called reverse game theory   which has private and public policy applications as to ways of improving economic efficiency through incentives for information sharing       in       nash  john harsanyi  and reinhard selten received the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences their work on non cooperative games  harsanyi and selten were awarded for their work on repeated games  later work extended their results to computational methods of modeling       agent based computational economics  ace  as a named field is relatively recent  dating from about the     s as to published work  it studies economic processes  including whole economies  as dynamic systems of interacting agents over time  as such  it falls in the paradigm of complex adaptive systems    in corresponding agent based models  agents are not real people but  computational objects modeled as interacting according to rules       whose micro level interactions create emergent patterns  in space and time    the rules are formulated to predict behavior and social interactions based on incentives and information  the theoretical assumption of mathematical optimization by agents markets is replaced by the less restrictive postulate of agents with bounded rationality adapting to market forces       ace models apply numerical methods of analysis to computer based simulations of complex dynamic problems for which more conventional methods  such as theorem formulation  may not find ready use    starting from specified initial conditions  the computational economic system is modeled as evolving over time as its constituent agents repeatedly interact with each other  in these respects  ace has been characterized as a bottom up culture dish approach to the study of the economy     in contrast to other standard modeling methods  ace events are driven solely by initial conditions  whether or not equilibria exist or are computationally tractable  ace modeling  however  includes agent adaptation  autonomy  and learning     it has a similarity to  and overlap with  game theory as an agent based method for modeling social interactions    other dimensions of the approach include such standard economic subjects as competition and collaboration     market structure and industrial organization     transaction costs     welfare economics    and mechanism design     information and uncertainty     and macroeconomics           the method is said to benefit from continuing improvements in modeling techniques of computer science and increased computer capabilities  issues include those common to experimental economics in general    and by comparison    and to development of a common framework for empirical validation and resolving open questions in agent based modeling     the ultimate scientific objective of the method has been described as  testing theoretical findings against real world data in ways that permit empirically supported theories to cumulate over time  with each researcher s work building appropriately on the work that has gone before         over the course of the   th century  articles in  core journals     in economics have been almost exclusively written by economists in academia  as a result  much of the material transmitted in those journals relates to economic theory  and  economic theory itself has been continuously more abstract and mathematical      a subjective assessment of mathematical techniques    employed in these core journals showed a decrease in articles that use neither geometric representations nor mathematical notation from     in      to      in          a      survey of ten of the top economic journals finds that onlyxa      of the articles published in      and      both lacked statistical analysis of data and lacked displayed mathematical expressions that were indexed with numbers at the margin of the page        between the world wars  advances in mathematical statistics and a cadre of mathematically trained economists led to econometrics  which was the name proposed for the discipline of advancing economics by using mathematics and statistics  within economics   econometrics  has often been used for statistical methods in economics  rather than mathematical economics  statistical econometrics features the application of linear regression and time series analysis to economic data     ragnar frisch coined the word  econometrics  and helped to found both the econometric society in      and the journal econometrica in             a student of frisch s  trygve haavelmo published the probability approach in econometrics in       where he asserted that precise statistical analysis could be used as a tool to validate mathematical theories about economic actors with data from complex sources     this linking of statistical analysis of systems to economic theory was also promulgated by the cowles commission  now the cowles foundation  throughout the     s and     s        the roots of modern econometrics can be traced to the american economist henry l  moore  moore studied agricultural productivity and attempted to fit changing values of productivity for plots of corn and other crops to a curve using different values of elasticity  moore made several errors in his work  some from his choice of models and some from limitations in his use of mathematics  the accuracy of moore s models also was limited by the poor data for national accounts in the united states at the time  while his first models of production were static  in      he published a dynamic  moving equilibrium  model designed to explain business cycles this periodic variation from overcorrection in supply and demand curves is now known as the cobweb model  a more formal derivation of this model was made later by nicholas kaldor  who is largely credited for its exposition        much of classical economics can be presented in simple geometric terms or elementary mathematical notation  mathematical economics  however  conventionally makes use of calculus and matrix algebra in economic analysis in order to make powerful claims that would be more difficult without such mathematical tools  these tools are prerequisites for formal study  not only in mathematical economics but in contemporary economic theory in general  economic problems often involve so many variables that mathematics is the only practical way of attacking and solving them  alfred marshall argued that every economic problem which can be quantified  analytically expressed and solved  should be treated by means of mathematical work        economics has become increasingly dependent upon mathematical methods and the mathematical tools it employs have become more sophisticated  as a result  mathematics has become considerably more important to professionals in economics and finance  graduate programs in both economics and finance require strong undergraduate preparation in mathematics for admission and  for this reason  attract an increasingly high number of mathematicians  applied mathematicians apply mathematical principles to practical problems  such as economic analysis and other economics related issues  and many economic problems are often defined as integrated into the scope of applied mathematics       this integration results from the formulation of economic problems as stylized models with clear assumptions and falsifiable predictions  this modeling may be informal or prosaic  as it was in adam smith s the wealth of nations  or it may be formal  rigorous and mathematical     broadly speaking  formal economic models may be classified as stochastic or deterministic and as discrete or continuous  at a practical level  quantitative modeling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other        according to the mathematics subject classification  msc   mathematical economics falls into the applied mathematics other classification of category        with msc     classifications for  game theory  at codes   axx and for  mathematical economics  at codes   bxx     the handbook of mathematical economics series  elsevier   currently   volumes  distinguishes between mathematical methods in economics  v     part i  and areas of economics in other volumes where mathematics is employed        another source with a similar distinction is the new palgrave  a dictionary of economics          vols         subject entries   in it  a  subject index  includes mathematical entries under   headings  vol  iv  pp xa            a widely used system in economics that includes mathematical methods on the subject is the jel classification codes  it originated in the journal of economic literature for classifying new books and articles  the relevant categories are listed below  simplified below to omit  miscellaneous  and  other  jel codes   as reproduced from jel classification codes mathematical and quantitative methods jel  c subcategories  the new palgrave dictionary of economics         nd ed   also uses the jel codes to classify its entries  the corresponding footnotes below have links to abstracts of the new palgrave online for each jel category     or fewer per page  similar to google searches      friedrich hayek contended that the use of formal techniques projects a scientific exactness that does not appropriately account for informational limitations faced by real economic agents         in an interview  the economic historian robert heilbroner stated        i guess the scientific approach began to penetrate and soon dominate the profession in the past twenty to thirty years  this came about in part because of the  invention  of mathematical analysis of various kinds and  indeed  considerable improvements in it  this is the age in which we have not only more data but more sophisticated use of data  so there is a strong feeling that this is a data laden science and a data laden undertaking  which  by virtue of the sheer numerics  the sheer equations  and the sheer look of a journal page  bears a certain resemblance to science       that one central activity looks scientific  i understand that  i think that is genuine  it approaches being a universal law  but resembling a science is different from being a science     heilbroner stated that  some much of economics is not naturally quantitative and therefore does not lend itself to mathematical exposition         philosopher karl popper discussed the scientific standing of economics in the     s and     s  he argued that mathematical economics suffered from being tautological  in other words  insofar that economics became a mathematical theory  mathematical economics ceased to rely on empirical refutation but rather relied on mathematical proofs and disproof     according to popper  falsifiable assumptions can be tested by experiment and observation while unfalsifiable assumptions can be explored mathematically for their consequences and for their consistency with other assumptions        sharing popper s concerns about assumptions in economics generally  and not just mathematical economics  milton friedman declared that  all assumptions are unrealistic   friedman proposed judging economic models by their predictive performance rather than by the match between their assumptions and reality        considering mathematical economics  j m  keynes wrote in the general theory        it is a great fault of symbolic pseudo mathematical methods of formalising a system of economic analysis     that they expressly assume strict independence between the factors involved and lose their cogency and authority if this hypothesis is disallowed  whereas  in ordinary discourse  where we are not blindly manipulating and know all the time what we are doing and what the words mean  we can keep  at the back of our heads  the necessary reserves and qualifications and the adjustments which we shall have to make later on  in a way in which we cannot keep complicated partial differentials  at the back  of several pages of algebra which assume they all vanish  too large a proportion of recent  mathematical  economics are merely concoctions  as imprecise as the initial assumptions they rest on  which allow the author to lose sight of the complexities and interdependencies of the real world in a maze of pretentious and unhelpful symbols     in response to these criticisms  paul samuelson argued that mathematics is a language  repeating a thesis of josiah willard gibbs  in economics  the language of mathematics is sometimes necessary for representing substantive problems  moreover  mathematical economics has led to conceptual advances in economics     in particular  samuelson gave the example of microeconomics  writing that  few people are ingenious enough to grasp its more complex parts    without resorting to the language of mathematics  while most ordinary individuals can do so fairly easily with the aid of mathematics         some economists state that mathematical economics deserves support just like other forms of mathematics  particularly its neighbors in mathematical optimization and mathematical statistics and increasingly in theoretical computer science  mathematical economics and other mathematical sciences have a history in which theoretical advances have regularly contributed to the reform of the more applied branches of economics  in particular  following the program of john von neumann  game theory now provides the foundations for
