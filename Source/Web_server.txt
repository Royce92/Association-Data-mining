 a web server is an information technology that processes requests via http  the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the world wide web  the term can refer either to the entire computer system  an appliance  or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the http requests              the primary function of a web server is to store  process and deliver web pages to clients  the communication between client and server takes place using the hypertext transfer protocol  http   pages delivered are most frequently html documents  which may include images  style sheets and scripts in addition to text content     a user agent  commonly a web browser or web crawler  initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using http and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message if unable to do so  the resource is typically a real file on the server s secondary storage  but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is implemented     while the primary function is to serve content  a full implementation of http also includes ways of receiving content from clients  this feature is used for submitting web forms  including uploading of files     many generic web servers also support server side scripting using active server pages  asp   php  or other scripting languages  this means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files  while the actual server software remains unchanged  usually  this function is used to generate html documents dynamically   on the fly   as opposed to returning static documents  the former is primarily used for retrieving and or modifying information from databases  the latter is typically much faster and more easily cached but cannot deliver dynamic content     web servers are not always used for serving the world wide web  they can also be found embedded in devices such as printers  routers  webcams and serving only a local network  the web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring and or administering the device in question  this usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer  since only a web browser is required  which now is included with most operating systems      in      tim berners lee proposed a new project to his employer cern  with the goal of easing the exchange of information between scientists by using a hypertext system  the project resulted in berners lee writing two programs in          between      and       the simplicity and effectiveness of early technologies used to surf and exchange data through the world wide web helped to port them to many different operating systems and spread their use among scientific organizations and universities  and then to industry     in      tim berners lee decided to constitute the world wide web consortium  w c  to regulate the further development of the many technologies involved  http  html  etc   through a standardization process     web servers are able to map the path component of a uniform resource locator  url  into     for a static request the url path specified by the client is relative to the web server s root directory     consider the following url as it would be requested by a client     the client s user agent will translate it into a connection to www example com with the following http     request     the web server on www example com will append the given path to the path of its root directory  on an apache server  this is commonly  home www  on unix machines  usually  var www   the result is the local file system resource     the web server then reads the file  if it exists and sends a response to the client s web browser  the response will describe the content of the file and contain the file itself or an error message will return saying that the file does not exist or is unavailable     a web server can be either implemented into the os kernel  or in user space  like other regular applications      an in kernel web server  like microsoft iis on windows or tux on gnu linux  will usually work faster  because  as part of the system  it can directly use all the hardware resources it needs  such as non paged memory  cpu time slices  network adapters  or buffers     web servers that run in user mode have to ask the system for permission to use more memory or more cpu resources  not only do these requests to the kernel take time  but they are not always satisfied because the system reserves resources for its own usage and has the responsibility to share hardware resources with all the other running applications  executing in user mode can also mean useless buffer copies which are another handicap for user mode web servers     a web server  program  has defined load limits  because it can handle only a limited number of concurrent client connections  usually between   and         by default between     and        per ip address  and tcp port  and it can serve only a certain maximum number of requests per second depending on     when a web server is near to or over its limit  it becomes unresponsive     at any time web servers can be overloaded because of     the symptoms of an overloaded web server are     to partially overcome above average load limits and to prevent overload  most popular web sites use common techniques like     below are the latest statistics of the market share of the top web servers on the internet by netcraft survey april  may          apache  iis and nginx are the most used web servers on the internet
