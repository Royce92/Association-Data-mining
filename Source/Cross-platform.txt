 in computing  cross platform  or multi platform  is an attribute conferred to computer software or computing methods and concepts that are implemented and inter operate on multiple computer platforms   the software and methods are also said to be platform independent  cross platform software may be divided into two types  one requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports  and the other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation  e g   software written in an interpreted language or pre compiled portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run time packages are common or standard components of all platforms      for example  a cross platform application may run on microsoft windows on the x   architecture  linux on the x   architecture and mac os x on either the powerpc or x   based apple macintosh systems  cross platform programs may run on as many as all existing platforms  or on as few as two platforms             the term platform can refer to the type of processor and or other hardware on which a given operating system or application runs  the type of operating system on a computer or the combination of the type of hardware and the type of operating system running on it   an example of a common platform is microsoft windows running on the x   architecture  other well known desktop computer platforms include linux unix and mac os x   both of which are themselves cross platform   there are  however  many devices such as smartphones that are also effectively computer platforms but less commonly thought about in that way  application software can be written to depend on the features of a particular platform either the hardware  operating system  or virtual machine it runs on  the java platform is a virtual machine platform which runs on many operating systems and hardware types  and is a common platform for software to be written for     a hardware platform can refer to a computer s architecture or processor architecture  for example  x   architecture and its variants such as ia    and x       these machines often run one version of microsoft windows   though they can run other operating systems as well  including linux  openbsd  netbsd  mac os x and freebsd     an arm architecture is common on smartphones and tablet computers  which run android  ios and other mobile operating systems     software platforms can either be an operating system or programming environment  though more commonly it is a combination of both  a notable exception to this is java  which uses an operating system independent virtual machine for its compiled code  known in the world of java as bytecode  examples of software platforms include     as previously noted  the java platform is an exception to the general rule that an operating system is a software platform  the java language typically compiles to a virtual machine  a virtual cpu which runs all of the code that is written for the language  this enables the same executable binary to run on all systems that implement a java virtual machine  jvm   java programs can be executed natively using a java processor  this isn t common and is mostly used for embedded systems     java code running in the jvm has access to os related services  like disk i o and network access  if the appropriate privileges are granted  the jvm makes the system calls on behalf of the java application  this setup allows users to decide the appropriate protection level  depending on an acl  for example  disk and network access is usually enabled for desktop applications  but not for browser based applets  jni can also be used to enable access to operating system specific functions     currently  java standard edition programs can run on microsoft windows  mac os x  several unix like operating systems  and several more non unix like operating systems  esp embedded   for mobile applications  browser plugins are used for windows and mac based devices  and android has built in support for java  there are also subsets of java  such as java card or java platform  micro edition  designed for resource constrained devices     for a piece of software to be considered cross platform  it must be able to function on more than one computer architecture or operating system  developing such program can be a time consuming task because different operating systems have different application programming interfaces  api   for example  linux uses a different api for application software than windows does     just because a particular operating system may run on different computer architectures  that does not mean that the software written for that operating system will automatically work on all architectures that the operating system supports  one example as of august       was openoffice org  which did not natively run on the amd   or intel    lines of processors implementing the x      standards for computers  this has since been changed  and the openoffice org suite of software is  mostly  ported to these    bit systems   this also means that just because a program is written in a popular programming language such as c or c    it does not mean it will run on all operating systems that support that programming language or even on the same operating system on a different architecture     web applications are typically described as cross platform because  ideally  they are accessible from any of various web browsers within different operating systems  such applications generally employ a client server system architecture  and vary widely in complexity and functionality  this wide variability significantly complicates the goal of cross platform capability  which is routinely at odds with the goal of advanced functionality     basic web applications perform all or most processing from a stateless server  and pass the result to the client web browser  all user interaction with the application consists of simple exchanges of data requests and server responses  these types of applications were the norm in the early phases of world wide web application development  such applications follow a simple transaction model  identical to that of serving static web pages  today  they are still relatively common  especially where cross platform compatibility and simplicity are deemed more critical than advanced functionalities     prominent examples of advanced web applications include the web interface to gmail  a  com  and the maps live com website  part of the live search service from microsoft  such advanced applications routinely depend on additional features found only in the more recent versions of popular web browsers  these dependencies include ajax  javascript  dynamic html  svg  and other components of rich internet applications  older versions of popular web browsers tend to lack support for certain features     because of the competing interests of cross platform compatibility and advanced functionality  numerous alternative web application design strategies have emerged  such strategies include     graceful degradation attempts to provide the same or similar functionality to all users and platforms  while diminishing that functionality to a least common denominator for more limited client browsers  for example  a user attempting to use a limited feature browser to access gmail may notice that gmail switches to basic mode  with reduced functionality  this differs from other cross platform techniques  which attempt to provide equivalent functionality  not just adequate functionality  across platforms     multiple codebase applications maintain distinct codebases for different  hardware and os  platforms  with equivalent functionality  this obviously requires a duplication of effort in maintaining the code  but can be worthwhile where the amount of platform specific code is high     this strategy relies on having one codebase that may be compiled to multiple platform specific formats  one technique is conditional compilation  with this technique  code that is common to all platforms is not repeated  blocks of code that are only relevant to certain platforms are made conditional  so that they are only interpreted or compiled when needed  another technique is separation of functionality  which disables functionality not supported by client browsers or operating systems  while still delivering a complete application to the user   see also  separation of concerns   this technique is used in web development where interpreted code  as in scripting languages  can query the platform it is running on to execute different blocks conditionally      third party libraries attempt to simplify cross platform capability by hiding the complexities of client differentiation behind a single  unified api     responsive web design  rwd  is a web design approach aimed at crafting the visual layout of sites to provide an optimal viewing experience easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing  panning  and scrolling across a wide range of devices  from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors  little or no platform specific code is used with this technique     one complicated aspect of cross platform web application design is the need for software testing  in addition to the complications mentioned previously  there is the additional restriction that some web browsers prohibit installation of different versions of the same browser on the same operating system  techniques such as full virtualization are sometimes used as a workaround for this problem     although web applications are becoming increasingly popular  many computer users still use traditional application software which does not rely on a client web server architecture  the distinction between traditional and web applications is not always unambiguous  however  because applications have many different features  installation methods and architectures  and some of these can overlap and occur in ways that blur the distinction  nevertheless  this simplifying distinction is a common and useful generalization     traditionally in modern computing  application software has been distributed to end users as binary file  especially executable files  executables only support the operating system and computer architecture that they were built for which means that making a single cross platform executable would be something of a massive task  and is generally replaced by offering a selection of executables for the platforms supported     for software that is distributed as a binary executable  such as software written in c or c    the programmer must build the software for each different operating system and computer architecture  i e  must use toolset that translates transcompiles a single codebase into multiple binary executables  for example  firefox  an open source web browser  is available on windows  os x  both powerpc and x   through what apple inc  calls a universal binary   linux  and  bsd on multiple computer architectures  the four platforms  in this case  windows  os x  linux  and  bsd  are separate executable distributions  although they come from the same source code     the use of different toolsets to perform different builds may not be sufficient to achieve a variety of working executables for different platforms  in this case  the software engineer must port it  i e  amend the code to be suitable to a new computer architecture or operating system  for example  a program such as firefox  which already runs on windows on the x   family  can be modified and re built to run on linux on the x    and potentially other architectures  as well  the multiple versions of the code may be stored as separate codebases  or merged into one codebase by conditional compilation  see above   note that  while porting must be accompanied by cross platform building  the reverse is not the case     as an alternative to porting  cross platform virtualization allows applications compiled for one cpu and operating system to run on a system with a different cpu and or operating system  without modification to the source code or binaries  as an example  apple s rosetta  which is built into intel based macintosh computers  runs applications compiled for the previous generation of macs that used powerpc cpus  another example is ibm powervm lx    which allows linux x   applications to run unmodified on the linux power operating system     a script can be considered to be cross platform if its interpreter is available on multiple platforms and the script only uses the facilities provided by the language  that is  a script written in python for a unix like system will likely run with little or no modification on windows  because python also runs on windows  there is also more than one implementation of python that will run the same scripts  e g   ironpython for  net framework   the same goes for many of the open source programming languages that are available and are scripting languages     unlike binary executable files  the same script can be used on all computers that have software to interpret the script  this is because the script is generally stored in plain text in a text file  there may be some issues  however  such as the type of new line character that sits between the lines  generally  however  little or no work has to be done to make a script written for one system  run on another     some quite popular cross platform scripting or interpreted languages are     cross platform is a term that can also apply to video games released on a range of video game consoles  specialized computers dedicated to the task of playing games  examples of cross platform video games include     each has been released across a variety of gaming platforms  such as the wii  playstation    xbox      personal computers  pcs   and mobile devices     the characteristics of a particular system may lengthen the time taken to implement a video game across multiple platforms  so  a video game may initially be released on a few platforms and then later released on remaining platforms  typically  this situation occurs when a new gaming system is released  because video game developers need to acquaint themselves with the hardware and software associated with the new console     some games may not become cross platform because of licensing agreements between developers and video game console manufacturers that limit development of a game to one particular console  as an example  disney could create a game with the intention of release on the latest nintendo and sony game consoles  should disney license the game with sony first  disney may in exchange be required to release the game solely on sony s console for a short time or indefinitely effectively prohibiting a cross platform release for the duration     several developers have implemented means to play games online while using different platforms  epic games  microsoft  and valve software all possess technology that allows xbox     and playstation   gamers to play with pc gamers  leaving the decision of which platform to use to consumers  the first game to allow this level of interactivity between pc and console games was quake   citation needed    games that feature cross platform online play include     cross platform programming is the practice of actively writing software that will work on more than one platform     there are different ways of approaching the problem of writing a cross platform application program  one such approach is simply to create multiple versions of the same program in different source trees in other words  the windows version of a program might have one set of source code files and the macintosh version might have another  while a foss  nix system might have another citation needed while this is a straightforward approach to the problem  it has the potential to be considerably more expensive in development cost  development time  or both  especially for the corporate entities  the idea behind this is to create more than two different programs that have the ability to behave similarly to each other  it is also possible that this means of developing a cross platform application will result in more problems with bug tracking and fixing  because the two different source trees would have different programmers  and thus different defects in each version  the smaller the programming team  the quicker the bug fixes tend to be citation needed    another approach that is used is to depend on pre existing software that hides the differences between the platforms called abstraction of the platform such that the program itself is unaware of the platform it is running on  it could be said that such programs are platform agnostic  programs that run on the java virtual machine  jvm  are built in this fashion  the programming in wlanguage  used by windev  webdev and windev mobile  is used to target a wide range of platforms  windows  linux   net  java  mac  internet  intranet  tablet  smartphone  windows   rt  windows mobile  windows phone  android  ios iphone ipad     some applications mix various methods of cross platform programming to create the final application  an example of this is the firefox web browser  which uses abstraction to build some of the lower level components  separate source subtrees for implementing platform specific features  like the gui   and the implementation of more than one scripting language to help facilitate ease of portability  firefox implements xul  css and javascript for extending the browser  in addition to classic netscape style browser plugins  much of the browser itself is written in xul  css  and javascript  as well     there are a number of tools    which are available to help facilitate the process of cross platform programming     there are certain issues associated with cross platform development  some of these include
