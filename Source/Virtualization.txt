 in computing  virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual  rather than actual  version of something  including  but not limited to  a virtual computer hardware platform  operating system  os   storage device  or computer network resources     virtualization began in the     s  as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications  since then  the meaning of the term has broadened              hardware virtualization or platform virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system  software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources  for example  a computer that is running microsoft windows may host a virtual machine that looks like a computer with the ubuntu linux operating system  ubuntu based software can be run on the virtual machine       in hardware virtualization  the host machine is the actual machine on which the virtualization takes place  and the guest machine is the virtual machine  the words host and guest are used to distinguish the software that runs on the physical machine from the software that runs on the virtual machine  the software or firmware that creates a virtual machine on the host hardware is called a hypervisor or virtual machine manager     different types of hardware virtualization include     hardware assisted virtualization is a way of improving overall efficiency of virtualization  it involves cpus that provide support for virtualization in hardware  and other hardware components that help improve the performance of a guest environment     hardware virtualization can be viewed as part of an overall trend in enterprise it that includes autonomic computing  a scenario in which the it environment will be able to manage itself based on perceived activity  and utility computing  in which computer processing power is seen as a utility that clients can pay for only as needed  the usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and overall hardware resource utilization  with virtualization  several operating systems can be run in parallel on a single central processing unit  cpu   this parallelism tends to reduce overhead costs and differs from multitasking  which involves running several programs on the same os  using virtualization  an enterprise can better manage updates and rapid changes to the operating system and applications without disrupting the user   ultimately  virtualization dramatically improves the efficiency and availability of resources and applications in an organization  instead of relying on the old model of  one server  one application  that leads to underutilized resources  virtual resources are dynamically applied to meet business needs without any excess fat   consonustech      hardware virtualization is not the same as hardware emulation  in hardware emulation  a piece of hardware imitates another  while in hardware virtualization  a hypervisor  a piece of software  imitates a particular piece of computer hardware or the entire computer  furthermore  a hypervisor is not the same as an emulator  both are computer programs that imitate hardware  but their domain of use in language differs     a snapshot is the state of a virtual machine  and generally its storage devices  at an exact point in time  a snapshot enables the virtual machine s state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later  effectively undoing any changes that occurred afterwards  this capability is useful as a backup technique  for example  prior to performing a risky operation     virtual machines frequently use virtual disks for their storage  in a very simple example  a    gigabyte hard disk drive is simulated with a    gigabyte flat file  any requests by the vm for a location on its physical disk are transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file  once such a translation layer is present  however  it is possible to intercept the operations and send them to different files  depending on various criteria  every time a snapshot is taken  a new file is created  and used as an overlay for its predecessors  new data are written to the topmost overlay  reading existing data  however  needs the overlay hierarchy to be scanned  resulting in accessing the most recent version  thus  the entire stack of snapshots is virtually a single coherent disk  in that sense  creating snapshots works similarly to the incremental backup technique     other components of a virtual machine can also be included in a snapshot  such as the contents of its random access memory  ram   bios settings  or its configuration settings   save state  feature in video game console emulators is an example of such snapshots     restoring a snapshot consists of discarding or disregarding all overlay layers that are added after that snapshot  and directing all new changes to a new overlay     the snapshots described above can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor  when the vm is temporarily stopped  snapshotted  moved  and then resumed on the new host  this is known as migration  if the older snapshots are kept in sync regularly  this operation can be quite fast  and allow the vm to provide uninterrupted service while its prior physical host is  for example  taken down for physical maintenance     similarly to the migration mechanism described above  failover allows the vm to continue operations if the host fails  however  in this case  the vm continues operation from the last known coherent state  rather than the current state  based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with     a video game console emulator is a program that allows a personal computer or video game console to emulate a different video game console s behavior  video game console emulators and hypervisors both perform hardware virtualization  words like  virtualization    virtual machine    host  and  guest  are not used in conjunction with console emulators     virtual machines running proprietary operating systems require licensing  regardless of the host machine s operating system  for example  installing microsoft windows into a vm guest requires its licensing requirements to be satisfied     desktop virtualization is the concept of separating the logical desktop from the physical machine     one form of desktop virtualization  virtual desktop infrastructure  vdi   can be thought of as a more advanced form of hardware virtualization  rather than interacting with a host computer directly via a keyboard  mouse  and monitor  the user interacts with the host computer using another desktop computer or a mobile device by means of a network connection  such as a lan  wireless lan or even the internet  in addition  the host computer in this scenario becomes a server computer capable of hosting multiple virtual machines at the same time for multiple users      as organizations continue to virtualize and converge their data center environment  client architectures also continue to evolve in order to take advantage of the predictability  continuity  and quality of service delivered by their converged infrastructure  for example  companies like hp and ibm provide a hybrid vdi model with a range of virtualization software and delivery models to improve upon the limitations of distributed client computing   selected client environments move workloads from pcs and other devices to data center servers  creating well managed virtual clients  with applications and client operating environments hosted on servers and storage in the data center  for users  this means they can access their desktop from any location  without being tied to a single client device  since the resources are centralized  users moving between work locations can still access the same client environment with their applications and data   for it administrators  this means a more centralized  efficient client environment that is easier to maintain and able to more quickly respond to the changing needs of the user and business       another form  session virtualization  allows multiple users to connect and log into a shared but powerful computer over the network and use it simultaneously  each is given a desktop and a personal folder in which they store their files   with multiseat configuration  session virtualization can be accomplished using a single pc with multiple monitors keyboards and mice connected     thin clients  which are seen in desktop virtualization  are simple and or cheap computers that are primarily designed to connect to the network  they may lack significant hard disk storage space  ram or even processing power  but many organizations are beginning to look at the cost benefits of eliminating  thick client  desktops that are packed with software  and require software licensing fees  and making more strategic investments   desktop virtualization simplifies software versioning and patch management  where the new image is simply updated on the server  and the desktop gets the updated version when it reboots  it also enables centralized control over what applications the user is allowed to have access to on the workstation     moving virtualised desktops into the cloud creates hosted virtual desktops  hvd   where the desktop images are centrally managed and maintained by a specialist hosting firm  benefits include scalability and the reduction of capital expenditure  which is replaced by a monthly operational cost      nested virtualization refers to the ability of running a virtual machine within another  having this general concept extendable to an arbitrary depth  in other words  nested virtualization refers to running one or more hypervisors inside another hypervisor  nature of a nested guest virtual machine does not need not be homogenous with its host virtual machine  for example  application virtualization can be deployed within a virtual machine created by using hardware virtualization       nested virtualization becomes more necessary as widespread operating systems gain built in hypervisor functionality  which in a virtualized environment can be used only if the surrounding hypervisor supports nested virtualization  for example  windows   is capable of running windows xp applications inside a built in virtual machine  furthermore  moving already existing virtualized environments into a cloud  following the infrastructure as a service  iaas  approach  is much more complicated if the destination iaas platform does not support nested virtualization         the way nested virtualization can be implemented on a particular computer architecture depends on supported hardware assisted virtualization capabilities  in case a particular architecture does not provide hardware support required for nested virtualization  various software techniques are employed to enable it    over time  more architectures gain required hardware support  for example  since the haswell microarchitecture  announced in        intel started to include vmcs shadowing as a technology that accelerates nested virtualization
