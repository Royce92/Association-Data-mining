 os   is a series of computer operating systems  initially created by microsoft and ibm  then later developed by ibm exclusively  the name stands for  operating system     because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as ibm s  personal system    ps     line of second generation personal computers  the first version of os   was released in december      and newer versions were released until december          os   was intended as a protected mode successor of pcxa dos  notably  basic system calls were modeled after ms dos calls  their names even started with  dos  and it was possible to create  family mode  applications  text mode applications that could work on both systems   because of this heritage  os   shares similarities with unix  xenix  and windows nt in many ways     os   is no longer marketed by ibm  and ibm standard support for os   was discontinued on    december        it has been since maintained with relatively few new features under the name of ecomstation             the development of os   began when ibm and microsoft signed the  joint development agreement  in august         it was code named  cp dos  and it took two years for the first product to be delivered     os       was announced in april      and released in december  the original release is textmode only  and a gui was introduced with os       about a year later  os   features an api for controlling the video display  vio  and handling keyboard and mouse events so that programmers writing for protected mode need not call the bios or access hardware directly  in addition  development tools include a subset of the video and keyboard apis as linkable libraries so that family mode programs are able to run under ms dos  a task switcher named program selector is available through the ctrl esc hotkey combination  allowing the user to select among multitasked text mode sessions  or screen groups  each can run multiple programs       communications and database oriented extensions were delivered in       as part of os       extended edition  sna  x    appc lu      lan manager  query manager  sql     the promised graphical user interface  gui   presentation manager  was introduced with os       in october         it had a similar user interface to windows      which was released in may of that year   the interface was replaced in versions     and     by a tweaked gui closer in appearance to windows          the extended edition of      sold only through ibm sales channels  introduced distributed database support to ibm database systems and sna communications support to ibm mainframe networks     in       version     introduced installable filesystems and notably the hpfs filesystem  hpfs provided a number of improvements over the older fat filesystem  including long filenames and a form of alternate data streams called extended attributes   in addition  extended attributes were also added to the fat file system      the extended edition of     introduced tcp ip and ethernet support     os   and windows related books of the late     s acknowledged the existence of both systems and promoted os   as the system for the future       the collaboration between ibm and microsoft unravelled in       between the releases of windows     and os        during this time  windows     became a tremendous success  selling millions of copies in its first year    much of its success was because windows      along with ms dos  was bundled with most new computers    os    on the other hand  was only available as an expensive stand alone software package  in addition  os   lacked device drivers for many common devices such as printers  particularly non ibm hardware    windows  on the other hand  supported a much larger variety of hardware  the increasing popularity of windows prompted microsoft to shift its development focus from cooperating on os   with ibm to building its own business based on windows       several technical and practical reasons contributed to this breakup     the two companies had significant differences in culture and vision  microsoft favored the open hardware system approach that contributed to its success on the pc  ibm sought to use os   to drive sales of its own hardware  including systems that could not support the features microsoft wanted  microsoft programmers also became frustrated with ibm s bureaucracy and its use of lines of code to measure programmer productivity    ibm developers complained about the terseness and lack of comments in microsoft s code  while microsoft developers complained that ibm s code was bloated       the two products have significant differences in api  os   was announced when windows     was near completion  and the windows api already defined  however  ibm requested that this api be significantly changed for os      therefore  issues surrounding application compatibility appeared immediately  os   designers hoped for source code conversion tools  allowing complete migration of windows application source code to os   at some point  however  os     x did not gain enough momentum to allow vendors to avoid developing for both os   and windows in parallel  ibm s involvement was much more successful in redefining windows  visual appearance after the     release  giving it what is today perceived as the  windows     look  citation needed    os     x targets the       processor and dos fundamentally doesn t  ibm insisted on supporting the intel       processor  with its    bit segmented memory mode  due to commitments made to customers who had purchased many       based ps   s because of ibm s promises surrounding os      until release     in april       os   ran in    bit protected mode and therefore could not benefit from the intel       s much simpler    bit flat memory model and virtual      mode features  this was especially painful in providing support for dos applications  while  in       windows         could run several cooperatively multitasked dos applications  including expanded memory  ems  emulation  os        released in       was still limited to one     kb  dos box      given these issues  microsoft started to work in parallel on a version of windows which was more future oriented and more portable  the hiring of dave cutler  former vms architect  in      created an immediate competition with the os   team  as cutler did not think much of the os   technology and wanted to build on his work at digital rather than creating a  dos plus   his  nt os     was a completely new architecture       ibm grew concerned about the delays in development of os       and the diversion of ibm funds earmarked for os   development towards windows citation needed initially  the companies agreed that ibm would take over maintenance of os       and development of os        while microsoft would continue development of os        in the end  microsoft decided to recast nt os       as windows nt  leaving all future os   development to ibm  from a business perspective  it was logical to concentrate on a consumer line of operating systems based on dos and windows  and to prepare a new high end system in such a way as to keep good compatibility with existing windows applications  while waiting for this new high end system to develop  microsoft would still receive licensing money from xenix and os   sales  windows nt s os   heritage can be seen in its initial support for the hpfs filesystem  text mode os     x applications  and os   lan manager network support  some early nt materials even included os   copyright notices embedded in the software citation needed one example of nt os     x support is in the win k resource kit  windows nt could also support os     x presentation manager and avio applications with the addition of the windows nt add on subsystem for presentation manager       os       was released in april       it provided a    bit api for native programs  though the os itself still contained some    bit code and drivers  it also included a new ooui  object oriented user interface  called the workplace shell  this was a fully object oriented interface that was a significant departure from the previous gui  rather than merely providing an environment for program windows  such as the program manager   the workplace shell provided an environment in which a user could manage programs  files and devices by manipulating objects on the screen  with the workplace shell  everything in the system is an  object  to be manipulated     os       was touted by ibm as  a better dos than dos and a better windows than windows     for the first time  os   was able to run more than one dos application at a time  this was so effective that it allowed os   to actually run a modified copy of windows      itself a dos extender  including windows     applications     because of the limitations of the intel       processor  os     x could run only one dos program at a time  and did this in a way that allowed the dos program to have total control over the computer  a problem in dos mode could crash the entire computer  in contrast  os       could benefit from the virtual      mode of the intel       processor to create a much safer virtual machine in which to run dos programs  this included an extensive set of configuration options to optimize the performance and capabilities given to each dos program  any real mode operating system  such as      xenix  could also be made to run using os   s virtual machine capabilities  subject to certain direct hardware access limitations     like most    bit environments  os   could not run protected mode dos programs using the older vcpi interface  unlike the standard mode of windows      it only supported programs written according to dpmi   microsoft discouraged the use of vcpi under windows      however  due to performance degradation        unlike windows nt  os   also always gave dos programs the possibility of masking real hardware interrupts  so any dos program could deadlock the machine this way  os   could however use a hardware watchdog on selected machines  notably ibm machines  to break out of such a deadlock  later  release     leveraged the enhancements of newer intel     and intel pentium processors the virtual interrupt flag  vif   which was part of the virtual mode extensions  vme  to solve this problem     compatibility with windows      and later windows      was achieved by adapting windows user mode code components to run inside a virtual dos machine  vdm   originally  a nearly complete version of windows code was included with os   itself  windows     in os        and windows     in os        later  ibm developed versions of os   that would use whatever windows version the user had installed previously  patching it on the fly  and sparing the cost of an additional windows license    it could either run full screen  using its own set of video drivers  or  seamlessly   where windows programs would appear directly on the os   desktop  the process containing windows was given fairly extensive access to hardware  especially video  and the result was that switching between a full screen winos   session and the workplace shell could occasionally cause issues       because os   only runs the user mode system components of windows  it is not compatible with windows device drivers  vxds  and applications needing them     multiple windows applications run by default in a single windows session   multitasking cooperatively and without memory protection   just as they would under native windows  however  to achieve true isolation between windows   x programs  os   also can run multiple copies of windows in parallel  with each copy residing in a separate vdm  the user can then optionally place each program either in its own windows session   with preemptive multitasking and full memory protection between sessions  though not within them   or allow some applications to run together cooperatively in a shared windows session while isolating other applications in one or more separate windows sessions  at the cost of additional hardware resources  this approach can protect each program in any given windows session  and each instance of windows itself  from every other program running in any separate windows session  though not from other programs running in the same windows session      whether windows applications are running in full screen or windowed mode  and in one windows session or several  it is possible to use dde between os   and windows applications  and ole between windows applications only       released in       os   version     was labelled as os   warp to highlight the new performance benefits  and generally to freshen the product image   warp  had originally been the internal ibm name for the release  ibm claimed that it had used star trek terms as internal names for past os   releases  and that this one seemed appropriate for external use as well  at the launch of os   warp in       patrick stewart was to be the master of ceremonies  however kate mulgrew   of the then upcoming series star trek  voyager was substituted at the last minute      p         os   warp offers a host of benefits over os        notably broader hardware support  greater multimedia capabilities  internet compatible networking  and it includes a basic office application suite known as ibm works  it was released in two versions  the less expensive  red spine  and the more expensive  blue spine   named for the color of their boxes    red spine  was designed to support microsoft windows applications by utilizing any existing installation of windows on the computer s hard drive   blue spine  includes windows support in its own installation  and so can support windows applications without a windows installation  as most computers were sold with microsoft windows pre installed and the price was less   red spine  was the more popular product citation needed os   warp connect which has full lan client support built in followed in mid       warp connect was nicknamed  grape       in os        most performance sensitive subsystems  including the graphics  gre  and multimedia  mmpm    systems  were updated to    bit code in a fixpack  and included as part of os        warp   brought about a fully    bit windowing system  while warp   introduced the object oriented    bit gradd display driver model     in       warp   added java and speech recognition software  ibm also released server editions of warp   and warp   which bundled ibm s lan server product directly into the operating system installation  a personal version of lotus notes was also included  with a number of template databases for contact management  brainstorming  and so forth  the uk distributed free demo cd rom of os   warp essentially contained the entire os and was easily  even accidentally  crackedclarification needed  meaning that even people who liked it did not have to buy it  this was seen as a backdoor tactic to increase the number of os   users  in the belief that this would increase sales and demand for third party applications  and thus strengthen os   s desktop numbers citation needed this suggestion was bolstered by the fact that this demo version had replaced another which was not so easily cracked  but which had been released with trial versions of various applications citation needed in       the july edition of australian personal computer magazine bundled software cd roms  included a full version of warp   that required no activation and was essentially a free release  special versions of os        and warp   also included symmetric multiprocessing  smp  support     os   sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals  however by the early     s it was overtaken by microsoft windows nt  while os   was arguably technically superior to microsoft windows     os   failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and stand alone desktop pc segments  there were reports that it could not be installed properly on ibm s own aptiva series of home pcs    microsoft made an offer in      where ibm would receive the same terms as compaq  the number one pc manufacturer at the time  for a license of windows     if ibm ended development of os   completely  ibm however refused and instead went with an  ibm first  strategy of promoting os   warp and disparaging windows  as ibm aimed to drive sales of its own software as well as hardware  by       windows    negotiations between ibm and microsoft  which were already difficult  stalled when ibm purchased lotus smartsuite  which would have directly competed with microsoft office  as a result of the dispute  ibm signed the license agreement    minutes before microsoft s windows    launch event  which was later than their competitors and this badly hurt sales of ibm pcs  ibm officials later conceded that os   would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the pc business             in      ibm started development on an intended replacement for os   called workplace os  this was an entirely new product  brand new code  that borrowed only a few sections of code from both the existing os   and aix products  it used an entirely new microkernel code base  intended  eventually  to host several of ibm s operating systems  including os    as microkernel  personalities   it also included major new architectural features including a system registry  jfs  support for unix graphics libraries  and a new driver model       workplace os was developed solely for power platforms  and ibm intended to market a full line of powerpcs in an effort to take over the market from intel  a mission was formed to create prototypes of these machines and they were disclosed to several corporate customers  all of whom raised issues with the idea of dropping intel     advanced plans for the new code base would eventually include replacement of the os     operating system by workplace os  as well as a microkernel product that would have been used in industries such as telecommunications and set top television receivers     a partial pre alpha version of workplace os was demonstrated at comdex where a bemused bill gates stopped by the booth  the second and last time it was shown in public was at an os   user group in phoenix az  where the pre alpha code refused to boot     it was released in       but with     m usd being spent per year on development of this as well as workplace os  and no possible profit or widespread adoption  the end of the entire workplace os and os   product line was near     a project was launched internally by ibm to evaluate the looming competitive situation with microsoft windows     primary concerns included the major code quality issues in the existing os   product  resulting in over    service packs  each requiring more diskettes than the original installation   and the ineffective and heavily matrixed development organization in boca raton  where the consultants reported that  basically  everybody reports to everybody   and austin     that study  tightly classified as  registered confidential  and printed only in numbered copies  identified untenable weaknesses and failures across the board in the personal systems division as well as across ibm as a whole  this resulted in a decision being made at a level above the division to cut over     of the overall budget for the entire product line  end all new development  including workplace os   eliminate the boca raton development lab  end all sales and marketing efforts of the product  and lay off over      development individuals  as well as sales and support personnel       m usd had been spent in the last full year  warp   became the last distributed version of os       a small and dedicated community remained for os   for many years after its final mainstream release    but overall  os   failed to catch on in the mass market and is little used outside certain niches where ibm traditionally had a stronghold  for example  many bank installations  especially automated teller machines  run os   with a customized user interface  french sncf national railways used os     x in thousands of ticket selling machines citation needed telecom companies such as nortel use os   in some voicemail systems  also  os   was used for the host pc used to control the satellite operations support system equipment installed at npr member stations from      to       and used to receive the network s programming via satellite citation needed    although ibm began indicating shortly after the release of warp   that os   would eventually be withdrawn  the company did not end support until december             sales of os   stopped on december           the latest ibm version is       which was released for both desktop and server systems in december       serenity systems has been reselling os   since       calling it ecomstation  version     was released in       after a series of preliminary  release candidates   version     ga  general availability  was released on    may         ecomstation version     ga was released on may                ibm is still delivering defect support for a fee      ibm urges customers to migrate their often highly complex applications to e business technologies such as java in a platform neutral manner  once application migration is completed  ibm recommends migration to a different operating system  suggesting linux as an alternative           as of     update  support for running os   under virtualization appears to be improving in several third party products  os   has historically been more difficult to run in a virtual machine than most other legacy x   operating systems because of its extensive reliance on the full set of features of the x   cpu  in particular  os   s use of ring   prevented it from running in vmware    emulators such as qemu and bochs don t suffer from this problem and can run os   citation needed a beta of vmware workstation     released in january      was the first hypervisor that could run os   at all  later  the company decided to drop official os   support     virtualpc from microsoft  originally connectix  has been able to run os   without hardware virtualization support for many years  it also provided  additions  code which greatly improves host guest os interactions in os    the additions are not provided with the current version of virtualpc  but the version last included with a release may still be used with current releases  at one point  os   was a supported host for virtualpc in addition to a guest  note that os   runs only as a guest on those versions of virtualpc that use virtualization  x   based hosts  and not those doing full emulation  virtualpc for mac      virtualbox from oracle corporation  originally innotek  later sun  supports os   warp      and     as well as ecomstation as guests  however  attempting to run os   and ecomstation can still be difficult  if not impossible to run  because of the strict requirements of vt x amd v hardware enabled virtualization and only acp  mcp  is reported to work in a reliable manner       the difficulties in efficiently running os   have  at least once  created an opportunity for a new virtualization company  a large bank in moscow needed a way to use os   on newer hardware that os   did not support  as virtualization software is an easy way around this  the company desired to run os   under a hypervisor  once it was determined that vmware was not a possibility  it hired a group of russian software developers to write a host based hypervisor that would officially support os    thus  the parallels  inc  company and their parallels workstation was born       atm vendors ncr corporation and diebold incorporated have both adopted microsoft windows xp as their migration path from os   citation needed    diebold incorporated initially shipped xp embedded edition exclusively  but following extensive pressure from customer banks to support a common os  switched to xp professional to match their primary competitor ncr corporation citation needed    os   has few native computer viruses    while it is not invulnerable by design  its reduced market share appears to have discouraged virus writers  there are  however  os   based antivirus programs  dealing with dos viruses and windows viruses that could pass through an os   server     many people hoped that ibm will release os   or a significant part of it as open source  petitions were held in      and       but ibm refused them  citing legal and technical reasons    it is unlikely that the entire os will be open at any point in the future because it contains third party code to which ibm does not have copyright  much of this code is from microsoft  also ibm once engaged in a technology transfer with commodore  licensing amiga technology for os       and above in exchange for the rexx scripting language    this means os   may have code not written by ibm  which can prevent the os from being open sourced in the future      on the other hand ibm donated object rexx for windows and os   to the open object rexx project maintained by the rexx language association on sourceforge       there was a petition to open parts of the os arranged by os world com  open source operating systems such as linux have already profited from os   indirectly through ibm s release of the improved jfs file system which was ported from the os   code base  as ibm didn t release the source of the os   jfs driver  developers ported the linux driver back to ecomstation and added the functionality to boot from a jfs partition  this new jfs driver has been integrated into ecomstation v     the successor of os       the graphic system has a layer named presentation manager that manages windows  fonts  and icons  this is similar in functionality to a non networked version of x   or the windows gdi  on top of this lies the workplace shell  wps  introduced in os        wps is an object oriented shell allowing the user to perform traditional computing tasks such as accessing files  printers  launching legacy programs  and advanced object oriented tasks using built in and third party application objects that extended the shell in an integrated fashion not available on any other mainstream operating system  wps follows ibm s common user access user interface standards     hardware vendors were reluctant to support device drivers for alternative operating systems including os   and linux  leaving users with few choices from a select few vendors  to relieve this issue for video cards  ibm licensed a reduced version of the scitech display drivers  allowing users to choose from a wide selection of cards supported through scitech s modular driver design       wps represents objects such as disks  folders  files  program objects  and printers using the system object model  som   which allows code to be shared among applications  possibly written in different programming languages  a distributed version called dsom allowed objects on different computers to communicate  dsom is based on corba  the object oriented aspect of som is similar to  and a direct competitor to  microsoft s component object model  though it is implemented in a radically different manner  for instance  one of the most notable differences between som and com is som s support for inheritance  one of the most fundamental concepts of oo programming  com does not have such support  som and dsom are no longer being developed     os   also includes a radical advancement in application development with compound document technology called opendoc  which was developed with apple  opendoc proved interesting as a technology  but was not widely used or accepted by users or developers  opendoc is also no longer being developed     the multimedia capabilities of os   are accessible through media control interface commands  the last update  bundled with the ibm version of netscape navigator plugins  added support for mpeg files  support for newer formats like png  progressive jpeg  divx  ogg  mp  comes from third parties  sometimes it is integrated with the multimedia system  but in other offers it comes as standalone applications     the tcp ip stack is based on the open source bsd stack as visible with sccs what compatible tools     some problems were classic subjects of comparison with other operating systems     os   has been widely used in iran export bank  bank saderat iran  in their teller machines  atms and local servers  over        working stations   as of       the bank moved to virtualize and renew their infrastructure by moving os   to virtual machines running over windows     os   was widely used in brazilian banks  banco do brasil had a peak        machines running os   warp in the     s  os   was used in automated teller machines until       the workstations and automated teller machines and attendment computers have been migrated to linux       os   has been used in the banking industry  suncorp bank in australia still ran its atm network on os   as late as       atms in perisher blue used os   as late as       and even the turn of the decade       os   was widely adopted by accounting professionals and auditing companies  in mid     s native    bit accounting software were well developed and serving corporate markets     os   ran the faulty baggage handling system at denver international airport  the os was eventually scrapped  but the software written for the system led to massive delays in the opening of the new airport  the os itself was not at fault  but the software written to run on the os  the baggage handling system was eventually removed     os   was used by radio personality howard stern  he once had a    minute on air rant about os   versus windows    and recommended os    he also used os   on his ibm    cd laptop     os   was used as part of the satellite operations support system  soss  for npr s public radio satellite system  soss was a computer controlled system using os   that npr member stations used to receive programming feeds via satellite  soss was introduced in      using os        and was retired in       when npr switched over to its successor  the contentdepot     os   was used to control the skytrain automated light rail system in vancouver  canada until the late     s when it was replaced by windows xp     os   was used in the london underground jubilee line extension signals control system  jlescs  in london  uk  this control system delivered by alcatel was in use from      to      i e  between abandonment before opening of the line s unimplemented original automatic train control system and the present seltrac system  jlescs did not provide automatic train operation only manual train supervision  six os   local site computers were distributed along the railway between stratford and westminster  the shunting tower at stratford

used in new york city s subway system for metrocards    p       os   was used in checkout systems at safeway supermarkets       os   was used by trenitalia  both for the desktops at ticket counters and for the automatic ticket counters up to       incidentally  the automatic ticket counters with os   were more reliable than the current ones running a flavor of windows citation needed    ibm has used os   in a wide variety of hardware products  effectively as a form of embedded operating system
