 a carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for or to offset an emission made elsewhere         carbon offsets are measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent  co e  and may represent six primary categories of greenhouse gases   carbon dioxide  co    methane  ch    nitrous oxide  n o   perfluorocarbons  pfcs   hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs   and sulfur hexafluoride  sf     one carbon offset represents the reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases     there are two markets for carbon offsets  in the larger  compliance market  companies  governments  or other entities buy carbon offsets in order to comply with caps on the total amount of carbon dioxide they are allowed to emit  this market exists in order to achieve compliance with obligations of annex   parties under the kyoto protocol  and of liable entities under the eu emission trading scheme  in       about      billion of carbon offsets were purchased in the compliance market  representing about     billion metric tons of co e reductions      in the much smaller  voluntary market  individuals  companies  or governments purchase carbon offsets to mitigate their own greenhouse gas emissions from transportation  electricity use  and other sources  for example  an individual might purchase carbon offsets to compensate for the greenhouse gas emissions caused by personal air travel  many companies  see list   offer carbon offsets as an up sell during the sales process so that customers can mitigate the emissions related with their product or service purchase  such as offsetting emissions related to a vacation flight  car rental  hotel stay  consumer good  etc    in       about      million of carbon offsets were purchased in the voluntary market  representing about       million metric tons of co e reductions      offsets are typically achieved through financial support of projects that reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the short  or long term  the most common project type is renewable energy    such as wind farms  biomass energy  or hydroelectric dams  others include energy efficiency projects  the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts  destruction of landfill methane  and forestry projects    some of the most popular carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind turbine projects       carbon offsetting has gained some appeal and momentum mainly among consumers in western countries who have become aware and concerned about the potentially negative environmental effects of energy intensive lifestyles and economies  the kyoto protocol has sanctioned offsets as a way for governments and private companies to earn carbon credits that can be traded on a marketplace  the protocol established the clean development mechanism  cdm   which validates and measures projects to ensure they produce authentic benefits and are genuinely  additional  activities that would not otherwise have been undertaken  organizations that are unable to meet their emissions quota can offset their emissions by buying cdm approved certified emissions reductions     offsets may be cheaper or more convenient alternatives to reducing one s own fossil fuel consumption  however  some critics object to carbon offsets  and question the benefits of certain types of offsets    due diligence is recommended to help businesses in the assessment and identification of  good quality  offsets to ensure offsetting provides the desired additional environmental benefits  and to avoid reputational risk associated with poor quality offsets       offsets are viewed as an important policy tool to maintain stable economies  one of the hidden dangers of climate change policy is unequal prices of carbon in the economy  which can cause economic collateral damage if production flows to regions or industries that have a lower price of carbon unless carbon can be purchased from that area  which offsets effectively permit  equalizing the price               the world resources institute defines a carbon offset as  a unit of carbon dioxide equivalent  co e  that is reduced  avoided  or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere       the collins english dictionary defines a carbon offset as  a compensatory measure made by an individual or company for carbon emissions  usually through sponsoring activities or projects which increase carbon dioxide absorption  such as tree planting       the environment protection authority of victoria  australia  defines a carbon offset as   a monetary investment in a project or activity elsewhere that abates greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions or sequesters carbon from the atmosphere that is used to compensate for ghg emissions from your own activities  offsets can be bought by a business or individual in the voluntary market  or within a trading scheme   a carbon offset usually represents one tonne of co  e       the stockholm environment institute defines a carbon offset as  a credit for negating or diminishing the impact of emitting a ton of carbon dioxide by paying someone else to absorb or avoid the release of a ton of co  elsewhere        the university of oxford environmental change institute defines a carbon offset as  mechanism whereby individuals and corporations pay for reductions elsewhere in order to offset their own emissions       the encyclop dia britannica defines a carbon offset as  any activity that compensates for the emission of carbon dioxide  co   or other greenhouse gases  measured in carbon dioxide equivalents co e  by providing for an emission reduction elsewhere        na carbon offset is a greenhouse gas  ghg  reduction that is used to counterbalance  or offset  a ghg emission  they are sometimes also referred to as carbon credits  vers  or cers       a carbon offset occurs when an individual or organization emits a given amount of ghg emissions but invests in measures that remove the equivalent volume of ghg emissions from the atmosphere or prevent the emissions from taking place at all  carbon offsets are a financial instrument that represents this reduction in ghg emissions       carbon offsets have several common features     in           billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent changed hands worldwide  up    per cent from       according to the study by carbon market research firm point carbon  of washington and oslo  but at eur   billion  or about      billion  the market s value was nearly unchanged compared with       with world carbon prices averaging eur      a ton  down about    per cent from the previous year  according to the study    the world bank s  state and trends of the carbon market         put the overall value of the market at      billion  but found that a significant part of this figure resulted from manipulation of a vat loophole       n      of offset volumes were contracted by the private sector   where corporate social responsibility and industry leadership were primary motivations for offset purchases         offset buyers  desire to positively impact the climate resilience of their supply chain or sphere of influence was evident in our data which identifies a strong relationship between buyers  business sectors and the project categories from which they contract offsets       the global carbon market is dominated by the european union  where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut their emissions or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market  under the european union emission trading scheme  eu ets   europe  which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand  will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years  as the u s  and china the world s top polluters have yet to establish mandatory emission reduction policies     on the whole  the u s  market remains primarily a voluntary market  but multiple cap and trade regimes are either fully implemented or near imminent at the regional level  the first mandatory  market based cap and trade program to cut co  in the u s   called the regional greenhouse gas initiative  rggi   kicked into gear in northeastern states in       growing nearly tenfold to      billion  according to point carbon  western climate initiative  wci  a regional cap and trade program including seven western states  california notably among them  and four canadian provinces has established a regional target for reducing heat trapping emissions of    percent below      levels by       a component of california s own global warming solutions act of       kicked off in early       requires high emissions industries to purchase carbon credits to cover emissions in excess of        co  metric tons     the cdm identifies over     types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets  which are grouped into broad categories  these project types include renewable energy  methane abatement  energy efficiency  reforestation and fuel switching       renewable energy offsets commonly include wind power  solar power  hydroelectric power and biofuel  some of these offsets are used to reduce the cost differential between renewable and conventional energy production  increasing the commercial viability of a choice to use renewable energy sources     renewable energy credits  recs  are also sometimes treated as carbon offsets  although the concepts are distinct  whereas a carbon offset represents a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  a rec represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources  to convert recs into offsets  the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions  typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid  this is known as an indirect offset  because the reduction doesn t take place at the project site itself  but rather at an external site   and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to  additional  emission reductions and who should get credit for any reductions that may occur      intel corporation is the largest purchaser of renewable power in the us       some offset projects consist of the combustion or containment of methane generated by farm animals  by use of an anaerobic digester     landfills   or other industrial waste  methane has a global warming potential  gwp     times that of co   when combusted  each molecule of methane is converted to one molecule of co   thus reducing the global warming effect by         an example of a project using an anaerobic digester can be found in chile where in december       the largest pork production company in chile  initiated a voluntary process to implement advanced waste management systems  anaerobic and aerobic digestion of hog manure   in order to reduce greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions       while carbon offsets that fund renewable energy projects help lower the carbon intensity of energy supply  energy conservation projects seek to reduce the overall demand for energy  carbon offsets in this category fund projects of several types     industrial pollutants such as hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs  and perfluorocarbons  pfcs  have a gwp many thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide by volume    because these pollutants are easily captured and destroyed at their source  they present a large and low cost source of carbon offsets  as a category  hfcs  pfcs  and n o reductions represent    per cent of offsets issued under the cdm       land use  land use change and forestry  lulucf  projects focus on natural carbon sinks such as forests and soil  deforestation  particularly in brazil  indonesia and parts of africa  account for about    per cent of greenhouse gas emissions    deforestation can be avoided either by paying directly for forest preservation  or by using offset funds to provide substitutes for forest based products  there is a class of mechanisms referred to as redd schemes  reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation   which may be included in a post kyoto agreement  redd credits provide carbon offsets for the protection of forests  and provide a possible mechanism to allow funding from developed nations to assist in the protection of native forests in developing nations     almost half of the world s people burn wood  or fiber or dung  for their cooking and heating needs citation needed fuel efficient cook stoves can reduce fuel wood consumption by    to      though the warming of the earth due to decreases in particulate matter  i e  smoke  from such fuel efficient stoves has not been addressed  there are a number of different types of lulucf projects     voluntary purchasers can offset their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon allowances from legally mandated cap and trade programs such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative or the european emissions trading scheme  by purchasing the allowances that power plants  oil refineries  and industrial facilities need to hold to comply with a cap  voluntary purchases tighten the cap and force additional emissions reductions     voluntary purchases can also be made through small scale and sometimes uncertified schemes such as those offered at south african based promoting access to carbon equity centre  pace     which nevertheless offer clear services such as poverty alleviation in the form of renewable energy development  also  as  easy carbon credits are coming to an end     these projects have the potential to develop projects that are either too small or too complicated to benefit from legally mandated cap and trade programs     once it has been accredited by the unfccc a carbon offset project can be used as carbon credit and linked with official emission trading schemes  such as the european union emission trading scheme   or kyoto protocol  as certified emission reductions  european emission allowances for the           second phase were selling for between    and    euros per metric ton of co  as of july          the voluntary chicago climate exchange also includes a carbon offset scheme that allows offset project developers to sell emissions reductions to ccx members who have voluntarily agreed to meet emissions reduction targets     the western climate initiative  a regional greenhouse gas reduction initiative by states and provinces along the western rim of north america  includes an offset scheme  likewise  the regional greenhouse gas initiative  a similar program in the northeastern u s   includes an offset program  a credit mechanism that uses offsets may be incorporated in proposed schemes such as the australian carbon exchange     a uk offset provider set up a carbon offsetting scheme that set up a secondary market for treadle pumps in developing countries  these pumps are used by farmers  using human power  in place of diesel pumps    however  given that treadle pumps are best suited to pumping shallow water  while diesel pumps are usually used to pump water from deep boreholes  it is not clear that the treadle pumps are actually achieving real emissions reductions  other companies have explored and rejected treadle pumps as a viable carbon offsetting approach due to these concerns     carbon retirement involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as a method for offsetting carbon emissions  under schemes such as the european union emission trading scheme  eu emission allowances  euas   which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  are issued to all the largest polluters  the theory is that by buying these allowances and permanently removing them  the price of euas increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce their emissions       due to their indirect nature  many types of offset are difficult to verify  some providers obtain independent certification that their offsets are accurately measured  to distance themselves from potentially fraudulent competitors  the credibility of the various certification providers is often questioned  certified offsets may be purchased from commercial or non profit organizations for us         per tonne of co     due to fluctuations of market price  annual carbon dioxide emissions in developed countries range from   to    tons per capita     accounting systems differ on precisely what constitutes a valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems  however formal standards for quantification exist based on collaboration between emitters  regulators  environmentalists and project developers  these standards include the voluntary carbon standard  green e climate  chicago climate exchange and the cdm gold standard  the latter of which expands upon the requirements for the clean development mechanism of the kyoto protocol     accounting of offsets may address the following basic areas     overall  carbon offsets improve the environment by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere  offset projects often also lead to a number of co benefits such as better air and water quality  and healthier communities       while the primary goal of carbon offsets is to reduce global carbon emissions  many offset projects also claim to lead to improvements in the quality of life for a local population  these additional improvements are termed co benefits  and may be considered when evaluating and comparing carbon offset projects  some possible co benefits from a project that replaces wood burning stoves with ovens using a less carbon intensive fuel include     in a recent survey conducted by ecosecurities  conservation international  ccba and climatebiz  of the     corporates surveyed more than    per cent rated community and environmental benefits as the prime motivator for purchasing carbon offsets       carbon offset projects can also negatively affect quality of life  for example  people who earn their livelihoods from collecting firewood and selling it to households could become unemployed if firewood is no longer used  a paper from the overseas development institute offers some indicators to be used in assessing the potential developmental impacts of voluntary carbon offset schemes       nputting a price on carbon encourages innovation by providing funding for new ways to reduce greenhouse gases in many sectors  carbon reduction goals drive the demand for offsets and carbon trading  encouraging the development of this new industry and offering opportunities for different sectors to develop and use innovative new technologies       carbon offset projects also provide savings   energy efficiency measures may reduce fuel or electricity consumption  leading to a potential reduction in maintenance and operating costs       in an effort to inform and safeguard business and household consumers purchasing carbon offsets  in         the uk government has launched a scheme for regulating carbon offset products    defra have created the  approved carbon offsetting  brand to use as an endorsement on offsets   approved by the uk government  the scheme sets standards for best practice in offsetting  approved offsets have to demonstrate the following criteria     the first company to qualify for the scheme was clear  followed by carbon footprint  carbon passport  pure  british airways and carbon retirement ltd     on    may      the department of energy and climate change announced that the quality assurance scheme would close on    june         the stated purpose of the quality assurance scheme was  to provide a straightforward route for those wishing to offset their emissions to identify quality offsets     critics of the closure therefore argued that without the scheme  businesses and individuals would struggle to identify quality carbon offsets       in      the scheme was relaunched as the quality assurance standard  qas     the qas is now run independently by quality assurance standard ltd which is a company limited by guarantee based in the united kingdom  the quality assurance standard is a comprehensive independent audit system for carbon offsets  approved offsets are checked against a    point checklist   to ensure they meet the very highest standards in the world     on    july       the first organisations were approved as meeting the new qas     the australian government is currently in a consultation period on the regulation of carbon offsets    on    december       the australian government released the emissions reduction fund green paper outlining its preferred design options for the emissions reduction fund  a carbon buy back model  the government invites public comment and written submissions on the green paper by  pm on friday    february            less than    pence in every pound spent on some carbon offset schemes goes directly to projects designed to reduce emissions    the figures reported by the bbc   and based on un data reported that typically   p goes to the set up and maintenance costs of an environmental project    p goes to the company that takes on the risk that the project may fail  the project s investors take   p  with smaller amounts of money being distributed between organisations involved in brokering and auditing the carbon credits  in that respect carbon offsets are similar to most consumer products  with only a fraction of sale prices going to the off shore producers  the rest being shared between investors and distributors who bring it to the markets  who themselves need to pay their employees and service providers such as advertising agencies most of the time located in expensive areas     some activists disagree with the principle of carbon offsets  likening them to roman catholic indulgences  a way for the guilty to pay for absolution rather than changing their behavior  george monbiot  an english environmentalist and writer  says that carbon offsets are an excuse for business as usual with regard to pollution      proponents hold that the indulgence analogy is flawed because they claim carbon offsets actually reduce carbon emissions  changing the business as usual  and therefore address the root cause of climate change    proponents of offsets claim that third party certified carbon offsets are leading to increased investment in renewable energy  energy efficiency  methane biodigesters and reforestation and avoided deforestation projectscitation needed  and claim that these alleged effects are the intended goal of carbon offsets  on october          responsibletravel com  once a strong voice in favour of carbon offsetting  announced that it would stop offering carbon offsetting to its clients  stating that  too often offsets are being used by the tourism industry in developed countries to justify growth plans on the basis that money will be donated to projects in developing countries  global reduction targets will not be met this way        on   february       travel networking site vida loca travel announced that they would donate   per cent of profits to international medical corps  as they feel that international aid can be more effective at cutting global warming in the long term than carbon offsetting  citing the work of economist jeffrey sachs       some environmentalists have questioned the effectiveness of tree planting projects for carbon offset purposes    critics point to the following issues with tree planting projects     tree planting projects can cause conflicts with indigenous people who are displaced or otherwise find their use of forest resources curtailed  for example  a world rainforest movement report   documents land disputes and human rights abuses at mount elgon  in march       a few days before receiving forest stewardship council certification for a project near mount elgon  the uganda wildlife authority evicted more than     families from the area and destroyed their homes and crops  that the project was taking place in an area of on going land conflict and alleged human rights abuses did not make it into project report citation needed a      report by oxfam international describes a case where over        farmers in uganda were displaced for a fsc certified plantation to offset carbon by london based new forests company      several certification standards exist  offering variations for measuring emissions baseline  reductions  additionality  and other key criteria  however  no single standard governs the industry  and some offset providers have been criticized on the grounds that carbon reduction claims are exaggerated or misleading  problems include           because offsets provide a revenue stream for the reduction of some types of emissions  they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more  so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline  this is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin  for example  one chinese company generated      million in carbon offsets by installing a   xa million incinerator to burn the hfcs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants  the huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely for the purpose of increasing production of hfcs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets  not only is this outcome environmentally undesirable  it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse      the practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy hfc          in nigeria oil companies flare off    per cent of the natural gas found  the agip oil company plans to build plants to generate electricity from this gas and thus claim     million offset credits a year  united states company pan ocean oil corporation has also applied for credits in exchange for processing its own waste gas in nigeria  oilwatch org s michael karikpo calls this  outrageous   as flaring is illegal in nigeria  adding that  it s like a criminal demanding money to stop committing crimes        although many carbon offset projects tout their environmental co benefits  some are accused of having negative secondary effects  point carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro electric projects as carbon offsets  some countries in the eu are not allowing large projects into the eu ets  because of their environmental impacts  even though they have been individually approved by the unfccc and world commission on dams    it is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given the fact that they are a relatively new form of carbon reduction  and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions       offset projects may also have negative social impacts  for example when local residents are evicted to enable a national park to be marketed as a carbon offset
