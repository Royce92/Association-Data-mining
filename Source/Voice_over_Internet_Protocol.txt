 voice over ip  voip  is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over internet protocol  ip  networks  such as the internet  other terms commonly associated with voip are ip telephony  internet telephony  broadband telephony  and broadband phone service     the term internet telephony specifically refers to the provisioning of communications services  voice  fax  sms  voice messaging  over the public internet  rather than via the public switched telephone network  pstn   the steps and principles involved in originating voip telephone calls are similar to traditional digital telephony and involve signaling  channel setup  digitization of the analog voice signals  and encoding  instead of being transmitted over a circuit switched network  however  the digital information is packetized  and transmission occurs as ip packets over a packet switched network  such transmission entails careful considerations about resource management different from time division multiplexing  tdm  networks     early providers of voice over ip services offered business models and technical solutions that mirrored the architecture of the legacy telephone network  second generation providers  such as skype  have built closed networks for private user bases  offering the benefit of free calls and convenience while potentially charging for access to other communication networks  such as the pstn  this has limited the freedom of users to mix and match third party hardware and software  third generation providers  such as google talk  have adopted  the concept of federated voip which is a departure from the architecture of the legacy networks  these solutions typically allow dynamic interconnection between users on any two domains on the internet when a user wishes to place a call     voip systems employ session control and signaling protocols to control the signaling  set up  and tear down of calls  they transport audio streams over ip networks using special media delivery protocols that encode voice  audio  video with audio codecs  and video codecs as digital audio by streaming media  various codecs exist that optimize the media stream based on application requirements and network bandwidth  some implementations rely on narrowband and compressed speech  while others support high fidelity stereo codecs  some popular codecs include   law and a law versions of g      g      which is a high fidelity codec marketed as hd voice by polycom  a popular open source voice codec known as ilbc  a codec that only uses  xa kbit s each way called g      and many others     voip is available on many smartphones  personal computers  and on internet access devices  calls and sms text messages may be sent over  g or wi fi              the acronym  voip  has been pronounced variably since the inception of the term  apart from spelling out the abbreviation letter by letter   vi o a  pi    vee oh eye pee   there are three likely possible pronunciations   vo a  pi    vo eye pee  and  vo  ip   vo ipp   have been used  but generally  the single syllable   v jp   voyp  as in voice  may be the most common within the industry      voice over ip has been implemented in various ways using both proprietary protocols and protocols based on open standards  examples of the voip protocols are     the h     protocol was one of the first voip protocols that found widespread implementation for long distance traffic  as well as local area network services  however  since the development of newer  less complex protocols such as mgcp and sip  h     deployments are increasingly limited to carrying existing long haul network traffic  in particular  the session initiation protocol  sip  has gained widespread voip market penetration     these protocols can be used by special purpose software  such as jitsi  or integrated into a web page  web based voip   like google talk     a major development that started in      was the introduction of mass market voip services that utilize existing broadband internet access  by which subscribers place and receive telephone calls in much the same manner as they would via the public switched telephone network  pstn   full service voip phone companies provide inbound and outbound service with direct inbound dialing  many offer unlimited domestic calling for a flat monthly subscription fee  this sometimes includes international calls to certain countries  phone calls between subscribers of the same provider are usually free when flat fee service is not available  a voip phone is necessary to connect to a voip service provider  this can be implemented in several ways     it is becoming increasingly common for telecommunications providers to use voip telephony over dedicated and public ip networks to connect switching centers and to interconnect with other telephony network providers  this is often referred to as  ip backhaul        smartphones and wi fi enabled mobile phones may have sip clients built into the firmware or available as an application download     because of the bandwidth efficiency and low costs that voip technology can provide  businesses are migrating from traditional copper wire telephone systems to voip systems to reduce their monthly phone costs  in           of all new private branch exchange  pbx  lines installed internationally were voip      voip solutions aimed at businesses have evolved into unified communications services that treat all communications phone calls  faxes  voice mail  e mail  web conferences  and more as discrete units that can all be delivered via any means and to any handset  including cellphones  two kinds of competitors are competing in this space  one set is focused on voip for medium to large enterprises  while another is targeting the small to medium business  smb  market      voip allows both voice and data communications to be run over a single network  which can significantly reduce infrastructure costs      the prices of extensions on voip are lower than for pbx and key systems  voip switches may run on commodity hardware  such as personal computers  rather than closed architectures  these devices rely on standard interfaces      voip devices have simple  intuitive user interfaces  so users can often make simple system configuration changes  dual mode phones enable users to continue their conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal wi fi network  so that it is no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cellphone  maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee      skype  which originally marketed itself as a service among friends  has begun to cater to businesses  providing free of charge connections between any users on the skype network and connecting to and from ordinary pstn telephones for a charge      in the united states the social security administration  ssa  is converting its field offices of        workers from traditional phone installations to a voip infrastructure carried over its existing data network         communication on the ip network is perceived as less reliable in contrast to the circuit switched public telephone network because it does not provide a network based mechanism to ensure that data packets are not lost  and are delivered in sequential order citation needed it is a best effort network without fundamental quality of service  qos  guarantees  therefore  voip implementations may face problems with latency  packet loss  and jitter         by default  network routers handle traffic on a first come  first served basis  network routers on high volume traffic links may introduce latency that exceeds permissible thresholds for voip  fixed delays cannot be controlled  as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel  however  latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay sensitive with methods such as diffserv       voip endpoints usually have to wait for completion of transmission of previous packets before new data may be sent  although it is possible to preempt  abort  a less important packet in mid transmission  this is not commonly done  especially on high speed links where transmission times are short even for maximum sized packets    an alternative to preemption on slower links  such as dialup and digital subscriber line  dsl   is to reduce the maximum transmission time by reducing the maximum transmission unit  but every packet must contain protocol headers  so this increases relative header overhead on every link traversed  not just the bottleneck  usually internet access  link       dsl modems provide ethernet  or ethernet over usb  connections to local equipment  but inside they are actually asynchronous transfer mode  atm  modems  they use atm adaptation layer    aal   to segment each ethernet packet into a series of    byte atm cells for transmission  reassembling them back into ethernet frames at the receiving end  a virtual circuit identifier  vci  is part of the   byte header on every atm cell  so the transmitter can multiplex the active virtual circuits  vcs  in any arbitrary order  cells from the same vc are always sent sequentially     however  a majority of dsl providers use only one vc for each customer  even those with bundled voip service  every ethernet frame must be completely transmitted before another can begin  if a second vc were established  given high priority and reserved for voip  then a low priority data packet could be suspended in mid transmission and a voip packet sent right away on the high priority vc  then the link would pick up the low priority vc where it left off  because atm links are multiplexed on a cell by cell basis  a high priority packet would have to wait at most    byte times to begin transmission  there would be no need to reduce the interface mtu and accept the resulting increase in higher layer protocol overhead  and no need to abort a low priority packet and resend it later     atm has substantial header overhead               roughly twice the total header overhead of a      byte ethernet frame  this  atm tax  is incurred by every dsl user whether or not they take advantage of multiple virtual circuitsxa  xa and few can       atm s potential for latency reduction is greatest on slow links  because worst case latency decreases with increasing link speed  a full size       byte  ethernet frame takes   xa ms to transmit at    xa kbit s but only  xa ms at    xa mbit s  if this is the bottleneck link  this latency is probably small enough to ensure good voip performance without mtu reductions or multiple atm vcs  the latest generations of dsl  vdsl and vdsl   carry ethernet without intermediate atm aal  layers  and they generally support ieee      p priority tagging so that voip can be queued ahead of less time critical traffic       voice  and all other data  travels in packets over ip networks with fixed maximum capacity  this system may be more prone to congestioncitation needed and dos attacks   than traditional circuit switched systems  a circuit switched system of insufficient capacity will refuse new connections while carrying the remainder without impairment  while the quality of real time data such as telephone conversations on packet switched networks degrades dramatically       fixed delays cannot be controlled as they are caused by the physical distance the packets travel  they are especially problematic when satellite circuits are involved because of the long distance to a geostationary satellite and back  delays of        xa ms are typical     when the load on a link grows so quickly that its switches experience queue overflows  congestion results and data packets are lost  this signals a transport protocol like tcp to reduce its transmission rate to alleviate the congestion  but voip usually uses udp not tcp because recovering from congestion through retransmission usually entails too much latency    so qos mechanisms can avoid the undesirable loss of voip packets by immediately transmitting them ahead of any queued bulk traffic on the same link  even when that bulk traffic queue is overflowing     the receiver must resequence ip packets that arrive out of order and recover gracefully when packets arrive too late or not at all  jitter results from the rapid and random  i e  unpredictable  changes in queue lengths along a given internet path due to competition from other users for the same transmission links  voip receivers counter jitter by storing incoming packets briefly in a  de jitter  or  playout  buffer  deliberately increasing latency to improve the chance that each packet will be on hand when it is time for the voice engine to play it  the added delay is thus a compromise between excessive latency and excessive dropout  i e  momentary audio interruptions     although jitter is a random variable  it is the sum of several other random variables that are at least somewhat independent  the individual queuing delays of the routers along the internet path in question  thus according to the central limit theorem  we can model jitter as a gaussian random variable  this suggests continually estimating the mean delay and its standard deviation and setting the playout delay so that only packets delayed more than several standard deviations above the mean will arrive too late to be useful  in practice  however  the variance in latency of many internet paths is dominated by a small number  often one  of relatively slow and congested  bottleneck  links  most internet backbone links are now so fast  e g    xa gbit s  that their delays are dominated by the transmission medium  e g  optical fiber  and the routers driving them do not have enough buffering for queuing delays to be significant     it has been suggested to rely on the packetized nature of media in voip communications and transmit the stream of packets from the source phone to the destination phone simultaneously across different routes  multi path routing     in such a way  temporary failures have less impact on the communication quality  in capillary routing it has been suggested to use at the packet level fountain codes or particularly raptor codes for transmitting extra redundant packets making the communication more reliable citation needed    a number of protocols have been defined to support the reporting of quality of service  qos  and quality of experience  qoe  for voip calls  these include rtcp extended report  rfc        sip rtcp summary reports  h       annex b  for h       h        and mgcp extensions  the rfc      voip metrics block is generated by an ip phone or gateway during a live call and contains information on packet loss rate  packet discard rate  because of jitter   packet loss discard burst metrics  burst length density  gap length density   network delay  end system delay  signal   noise   echo level  mean opinion scores  mos  and r factors and configuration information related to the jitter buffer     rfc      voip metrics reports are exchanged between ip endpoints on an occasional basis during a call  and an end of call message sent via sip rtcp summary report or one of the other signaling protocol extensions  rfc      voip metrics reports are intended to support real time feedback related to qos problems  the exchange of information between the endpoints for improved call quality calculation and a variety of other applications     rural areas in particular are greatly hindered in their ability to choose a voip system over pbx  this is generally down to the poor access to superfast broadband in rural country areas  with the release of  g data  there is a potential for corporate users based outside of populated areas to switch their internet connection to  g data  which is comparatively as fast as a regular superfast broadband connection  this greatly enhances the overall quality and user experience of a voip system in these areas  this method was already trialled in rural germany  surpassing all expectations       a number of protocols that deal with the data link layer and physical layer include quality of service mechanisms that can be used to ensure that applications like voip work well even in congested scenarios  some examples include     the media voip gateway connects the digital media stream  so as to complete creating the path for voice as well as data media  it includes the interface for connecting the standard pstn networks with the atm and inter protocol networks  the ethernet interfaces are also included in the modern systems  which are specially designed to link calls that are passed via the voip       e     is a global fgfnumbering standard for both the pstn and plmn  most voip implementations support e     to allow calls to be routed to and from voip subscribers and the pstn plmn    voip implementations can also allow other identification techniques to be used  for example  skype allows subscribers to choose  skype names     usernames  whereas sip implementations can use uris   similar to email addresses  often voip implementations employ methods of translating non e     identifiers to e     numbers and vice versa  such as the skype in service provided by skype   and the enum service in ims and sip       echo can also be an issue for pstn integration    common causes of echo include impedance mismatches in analog circuitry and acoustic coupling of the transmit and receive signal at the receiving end     local number portability  lnp  and mobile number portability  mnp  also impact voip business  in november       the federal communications commission in the united states released an order extending number portability obligations to interconnected voip providers and carriers that support voip providers    number portability is a service that allows a subscriber to select a new telephone carrier without requiring a new number to be issued  typically  it is the responsibility of the former carrier to  map  the old number to the undisclosed number assigned by the new carrier  this is achieved by maintaining a database of numbers  a dialed number is initially received by the original carrier and quickly rerouted to the new carrier  multiple porting references must be maintained even if the subscriber returns to the original carrier  the fcc mandates carrier compliance with these consumer protection stipulations     a voice call originating in the voip environment also faces challenges to reach its destination if the number is routed to a mobile phone number on a traditional mobile carrier  voip has been identified in the past as a least cost routing  lcr  system  which is based on checking the destination of each telephone call as it is made  and then sending the call via the network that will cost the customer the least  this rating is subject to some debate given the complexity of call routing created by number portability  with gsm number portability now in place  lcr providers can no longer rely on using the network root prefix to determine how to route a call  instead  they must now determine the actual network of every number before routing the call     therefore  voip solutions also need to handle mnp when routing a voice call  in countries without a central database  like the uk  it might be necessary to query the gsm network about which home network a mobile phone number belongs to  as the popularity of voip increases in the enterprise markets because of least cost routing options  it needs to provide a certain level of reliability when handling calls     mnp checks are important to assure that this quality of service is met  handling mnp lookups before routing a call provides some assurance that the voice call will actually work     a telephone connected to a land line has a direct relationship between a telephone number and a physical location  which is maintained by the telephone company and available to emergency responders via the national emergency response service centers in form of emergency subscriber lists  when an emergency call is received by a center the location is automatically determined from its databases and displayed on the operator console     in ip telephony  no such direct link between location and communications end point exists  even a provider having hardware infrastructure  such as a dsl provider  may only know the approximate location of the device  based on the ip address allocated to the network router and the known service address  however  some isps do not track the automatic assignment of ip addresses to customer equipment       ip communication provides for device mobility  for example  a residential broadband connection may be used as a link to a virtual private network of a corporate entity  in which case the ip address being used for customer communications may belong to the enterprise  not being the network address of the residential isp  such off premise extensions may appear as part of an upstream ip pbx  on mobile devices  e g   a  g handset or usb wireless broadband adapter  the ip address has no relationship with any physical location known to the telephony service provider  since a mobile user could be anywhere in a region with network coverage  even roaming via another cellular company     at the voip level  a phone or gateway may identify itself with a session initiation protocol  sip  registrar by its account credentials  in such cases  the internet telephony service provider  itsp  only knows that a particular user s equipment is active  service providers often provide emergency response services by agreement with the user who registers a physical location and agrees that emergency services are only provided to that address if an emergency number is called from the ip device     such emergency services are provided by voip vendors in the united states by a system called enhanced      e      based on the wireless communications and public safety act of       the voip e    emergency calling system associates a physical address with the calling party s telephone number  all voip providers that provide access to the public switched telephone network are required to implement e       a service for which the subscriber may be charged  however  end customer participation in e    is not mandatory and customers may opt out of the service       the voip e    system is based on a static table lookup  unlike in cellular phones  where the location of an e    call can be traced using assisted gps or other methods  the voip e    information is only accurate so long as subscribers  who have the legal responsibility  are diligent in keeping their emergency address information current     support for fax has been problematic in many voip implementations  as most voice digitization and compression codecs are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet based  connection less network  an alternative ip based solution for delivering fax over ip called t    is available  sending faxes using voip is sometimes referred to as foip  or fax over ip     the t    protocol is designed to compensate for the differences between traditional packet less communications over analog lines and packet based transmissions which are the basis for ip communications  the fax machine could be a traditional fax machine connected to the pstn  or an ata box  or similar   it could be a fax machine with an rj    connector plugged straight into an ip network  or it could be a computer pretending to be a fax machine    originally  t    was designed to use udp and tcp transmission methods across an ip network  tcp is better suited for use between two ip devices  however  older fax machines  connected to an analog system  benefit from udp near real time characteristics due to the  no recovery rule  when a udp packet is lost or an error occurs during transmission    udp transmissions are preferred as they do not require testing for dropped packets and as such since each t    packet transmission includes a majority of the data sent in the prior packet  a t    termination point has a higher degree of success in re assembling the fax transmission back into its original form for interpretation by the end device  this in an attempt to overcome the obstacles of simulating real time transmissions using packet based protocol       there have been updated versions of t    to resolve the fax over ip issues  which is the core fax protocol  some newer high end fax machines have t    built in capabilities which allow the user to plug right into the network and transmit receive faxes in native t    like the ricoh     nf fax machine    a unique feature of t    is that each packet contains a portion of the main data sent in the previous packet  with t     two successive lost packets are needed to actually lose any data  the data one will lose will only be a small piece  but with the right settings and error correction mode  there is an increased likelihood that they will receive enough of the transmission to satisfy the requirements of the fax machine for output of the sent document     while many late model analog telephone adapters  atas  support t     uptake has been limited as many voice over ip providers perform least cost routing which selects the least expensive pstn gateway in the called city for an outbound message  there is typically no means to ensure that that gateway is t    capable  providers often place their own equipment  such as an asterisk pbx installation  in the signal path  which creates additional issues as every link in the chain must be t    aware for the protocol to work  similar issues arise if a provider is purchasing local direct inward dial numbers from the lowest bidder in each city  as many of these may not be t    enabled     telephones for traditional residential analog service are usually connected directly to telephone company phone lines which provide direct current to power most basic analog handsets independently of locally available electrical power     ip phones and voip telephone adapters connect to routers or cable modems which typically depend on the availability of mains electricity or locally generated power    some voip service providers use customer premises equipment  e g   cablemodems  with battery backed power supplies to assure uninterrupted service for up to several hours in case of local power failures  such battery backed devices typically are designed for use with analog handsets     some voip service providers implement services to route calls to other telephone services of the subscriber  such a cellular phone  in the event that the customer s network device is inaccessible to terminate the call     the susceptibility of phone service to power failures is a common problem even with traditional analog service in areas where many customers purchase modern telephone units that operate with wireless handsets to a base station  or that have other modern phone features  such as built in voicemail or phone book features     the historical separation of ip networks and the pstn provided redundancy when no portion of a call was routed over ip network  an ip network outage would not necessarily mean that a voice communication outage would occur simultaneously  allowing phone calls to be made during ip network outages  when telephone service relies on ip network infrastructure such as the internet  a network failure can isolate users from all telephony communication  including enhanced     and equivalent services in other locales original research  however  the network design envisioned by darpa in the early     s included a fault tolerant architecture under adverse conditions     the security concerns of voip telephone systems are similar to those of any internet connected device  this means that hackers who know about these vulnerabilities can institute denial of service attacks  harvest customer data  record conversations and compromise voicemail messages  the quality of internet connection determines the quality of the calls  voip phone service also will not work if there is power outage and when the internet connection is down  the       or     service provided by voip phone service is also different from analog phone which is associated with a fixed address  the emergency center may not be able to determine your location based on your virtual phone number        compromised voip user account or session credentials may enable an attacker to incur substantial charges from third party services  such as long distance or international telephone calling     the technical details of many voip protocols create challenges in routing voip traffic through firewalls and network address translators  used to interconnect to transit networks or the internet  private session border controllers are often employed to enable voip calls to and from protected networks  other methods to traverse nat devices involve assistive protocols such as stun and interactive connectivity establishment  ice      many consumer voip solutions do not support encryption of the signaling path or the media  however securing a voip phone is conceptually easier to implement than on traditional telephone circuits  a result of the lack of encryption is a relative easy to eavesdrop on voip calls when access to the data network is possible    free open source solutions  such as wireshark  facilitate capturing voip conversations     standards for securing voip are available in the secure real time transport protocol  srtp  and the zrtp protocol for analog telephony adapters as well as for some softphones  ipsec is available to secure point to point voip at the transport level by using opportunistic encryption     government and military organizations use various security measures to protect voip traffic  such as voice over secure ip  vosip   secure voice over ip  svoip   and secure voice over secure ip  svosip     the distinction lies in whether encryption is applied in the telephone or in the network   or both  secure voice over secure ip is accomplished by encrypting voip with protocols such as srtp or zrtp  secure voice over ip is accomplished by using type   encryption on a classified network  like siprnet            public secure voip is also available with free gnu programs and in many popular commercial voip programs via libraries such as zrtp       caller id support among voip providers varies  but is provided by the majority of voip providers  many voip service providers allow callers to configure arbitrary caller id information  thus permitting spoofing attacks    business grade voip equipment and software often makes it easy to modify caller id information  providing many businesses great flexibility     the united states enacted the truth in caller id act of      on december           this law makes it a crime to  knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to defraud  cause harm  or wrongfully obtain anything of valuexa         rules implementing the law were adopted by the federal communications commission on june                most analog telephone adapters do not decode dial pulses generated by older telephones  supporting only touch tone  pulse to tone converters are commercially available    a user reports that a few specific ata models  such as the grandstream      recognise pulse dial directly      but are poorly documented and provide no assurance that newer models in the same series will retain this compatibility  this however  will only work for one voip conversation at a time       another challenge for voip implementations is the proper handling of outgoing calls from other telephony devices such as digital video recorders  satellite television receivers  alarm systems  conventional modems and other similar devices that depend on access to a pstn telephone line for some or all of their functionality     these types of calls sometimes complete without any problems  but in other cases they fail  if voip and cellular substitution becomes very popular  some ancillary equipment makers may be forced to redesign equipment  because it would no longer be possible to assume a conventional pstn telephone line would be available in consumers  houses     voice over ip services typically take advantage of other internet  or web based facilities for operation and administration  websites provide customer interaction  account configuration  service statistics  and billing  in addition  voip communication sessions may be launched directly from web pages or software that issue requests to web based facilities     web based voip uses this integration to conduct telephone sessions without the need for a telephone set  be it conventional pots  or ip based  an example is the click to call service  in which a software agent running in the web browser permits users to click on a telephone number embedded in any web page to initiate a telephone call  the service only requires a microphone and an audio head set connected to the user s computer     voip can be a benefit for reducing communication and infrastructure costs  examples include     as the popularity of voip grows  governments are becoming more interested in regulating voip in a manner similar to pstn services       throughout the developing world  countries where regulation is weak or captured by the dominant operator  restrictions on the use of voip are imposed  including in panama where voip is taxed  guyana where voip is prohibited and india where its retail commercial sales is allowed but only for long distance service    in ethiopia  where the government is nationalising telecommunication service  it is a criminal offence to offer services using voip  the country has installed firewalls to prevent international calls being made using voip  these measures were taken after the popularity of voip reduced the income generated by the state owned telecommunication company     in the european union  the treatment of voip service providers is a decision for each national telecommunications regulator  which must use competition law to define relevant national markets and then determine whether any service provider on those national markets has  significant market power   and so should be subject to certain obligations   a general distinction is usually made between voip services that function over managed networks  via broadband connections  and voip services that function over unmanaged networks  essentially  the internet  citation needed    the relevant eu directive is not clearly drafted concerning obligations which can exist independently of market power  e g   the obligation to offer access to emergency calls   and it is impossible to say definitively whether voip service providers of either type are bound by them  a review of the eu directive is under way and should be complete by      citation needed    in india  it is legal to use voip  but it is illegal to have voip gateways inside india    this effectively means that people who have pcs can use them to make a voip call to any number  but if the remote side is a normal phone  the gateway that converts the voip call to a pots call is not permitted by law to be inside india  foreign based voip server services are illegal to use in india       in the interest of the access service providers and international long distance operators the internet telephony was permitted to the isp with restrictions  internet telephony is considered to be different service in its scope  nature and kind from real time voice as offered by other access service providers and long distance carriers  hence the following type of internet telephony are permitted in india       in the uae and oman it is illegal to use any form of voip  to the extent that web sites of gizmo  are blocked  providing or using voip services is illegal in oman  those who violate the law stand to be fined        omani rial  about         us dollars  or spend two years in jail or both  in       police in oman have raided     internet cafes throughout the country and arrested     people for using providing voip services citation needed    in south korea  only providers registered with the government are authorized to offer voip services  unlike many voip providers  most of whom offer flat rates  korean voip services are generally metered and charged at rates similar to terrestrial calling  foreign voip providers encounter high barriers to government registration  this issue came to a head in      when internet service providers providing personal internet services by contract to united states forces korea members residing on usfk bases threatened to block off access to voip services used by usfk members as an economical way to keep in contact with their families in the united states  on the grounds that the service members  voip providers were not registered  a compromise was reached between usfk and korean telecommunications officials in january       wherein usfk service members arriving in korea before june          and subscribing to the isp services provided on base may continue to use their us based voip subscription  but later arrivals must use a korean based voip provider  which by contract will offer pricing similar to the flat rates offered by us voip providers       in the united states  the federal communications commission requires all interconnected voip service providers to comply with requirements comparable to those for traditional telecommunications service providers    voip operators in the us are required to support local number portability  make service accessible to people with disabilities  pay regulatory fees  universal service contributions  and other mandated payments  and enable law enforcement authorities to conduct surveillance pursuant to the communications assistance for law enforcement act  calea      operators of  interconnected  voip  fully connected to the pstn  are mandated to provide enhanced     service without special request  provide for customer location updates  clearly disclose any limitations on their e     functionality to their consumers  obtain affirmative acknowledgements of these disclosures from all consumers    and  may not allow their customers to  opt out  of     service     voip operators also receive the
