 uptime is a measure of the time a machine  typically a computer  has been working and available  uptime is the antonym of downtime     it is often used as a measure of computer operating system reliability or stability  in that this time represents the time a computer can be left unattended without crashing  or needing to be rebooted for administrative or maintenance purposes citation needed    conversely  long uptime may indicate negligence  because some critical updates can require reboots on some platforms              in       novell reported a server with a   year uptime    although that might sound unusual  that is actually common when servers are maintained under an industrial context and host critical applications such as banking systems     netcraft maintains the uptime records for many thousands of web hosting computers     a server running novell netware has been reported to have been shut down after    years of uptime due to a failing hard disk       users of windows xp professional  windows server      and windows vista systems can type systeminfo at the command prompt to display all system information  including the system up time      note  windows vista business    bit and windows   do not return a  system up time  but  system boot time  instead  also note that the exact text and date format is dependent of the language and locale windows is running     note  windows   s  system boot time  is not a reliable indicator of boot time  it does not take into account the time spent in sleep or hibernation mode  hence  the boot time drifts forward every time the computer is left in sleep or hibernate mode     the line that start with  statistics since      provides the time that the server was up from  the commands  net stats wksta  and  net stats srv  are shorthand for  net statistics workstation  and  net statistics server    the exact text and date format is dependent of the language and locale windows is running     microsoft has also provided a downloadable utility      note  windows   s uptime exe utility is not a reliable indicator of total uptime either  it gives the same wrong information along with boot time and task manager s uptime  it does not take into account the time spent in sleep or hibernation mode  the only real indicator may be the one given through  net statistics workstation  under  statistics      uptime can also be determined via windows management instrumentation from the command line with wmic     the timestamp is in the format yyyymmddhhmmss nnn  so this is a computer that last booted up on   may      at               wmi can also be used to find the boot time of remote computers as well  windows permissions allowing   for example with wmic     the text  lastbootuptime  and the timestamp format are always the same regardless of the language and locale  windows is running     wmi can also be used via a programming language such as vbscript or powershell       users of windows vista  windows   and windows   can see uptime in windows task manager under the tab performance  the uptime format is dd hh mm ss  that is days hours minutes seconds that the system has been up     users of linux systems can use the uptime utility  uptime   xa  xa linux user commands manual  to get the uptime  together with the current time  the number of users and load averages for the past      and    minute intervals     shows how long the system has been on since it was last restarted     the first number is the total number of seconds the system has been up  the second number is how much of that time the machine has spent idle  in seconds    on multi core systems  and some linux versions  the second number is the sum of the idle time accumulated by each cpu       like linux  bsd based operating systems such as freebsd and mac os x also have the uptime command  see uptime   xa  xa freebsd general commands manual      there is also a method of using sysctl to call the system s last boot time       users of openvms systems can type show system at the command prompt       this shows the uptime as days then hours minutes seconds     there are a many external services which can be used to monitor the uptime and downtime as well as availability of a service or a host  some examples
