 a    inch rack is a standardized frame or enclosure for mounting multiple equipment modules  each module has a front panel that is    inches       xa mm  wide  including edges or ears that protrude on each side which allow the module to be fastened to the rack frame with screws             equipment designed to be placed in a rack is typically described as rack mount  rack mount instrument  a rack mounted system  a rack mount chassis  subrack  rack mountable  or occasionally simply shelf  the height of the electronic modules is also standardized as multiples of       inches       xa mm  or one rack unit or u  less commonly ru    the industry standard rack cabinet is   u tall     the term relay rack appeared first in the world of telephony   by       the term was also being used in railroad signaling   there is little evidence that the dimensions of these early racks were standardized  the    inch rack format with rack units of      inches and holes tapped for       screws with alternating spacings of      inches and     inch was an established standard by        the eia standard was revised again in      to comply with the      public law          setting the standard u as     mm      mm       mm       mm   making each  u  officially       inches      the    inch rack format has remained constant while the technology that is mounted within it has changed considerably and the set of fields to which racks are applied has greatly expanded  the    inch       xa mm  standard rack arrangement is widely used throughout the telecommunication  computing  audio  video  entertainment and other industries  though the western electric    inch standard  with holes on   inch      xa mm  centers  is still used in legacy ilec clec facilities        inch racks in   post or   post form hold most equipment in modern data centers  isp facilities and professionally designed corporate server rooms  they allow for dense hardware configurations without occupying excessive floorspace or requiring shelving        inch racks are also often used to house professional audio and video equipment  including amplifiers  effects units  interfaces  headphone amplifiers  and even small scale audio mixers  a third common use for rack mounted equipment is industrial power  control  and automation hardware     typically  a piece of equipment being installed has a front panel height      inch        inches or       millimetres  less than the allotted number of us  thus  a  u rackmount computer is not      inches      xa mm  tall but is       inches      xa mm  tall   u would be       inches      xa mm  instead of     inches      xa mm   this gap allows a bit of room above and below an installed piece of equipment so it may be removed without binding on the adjacent equipment     in       a durable fiber reinforced plastic    inch rackmount case was patented by ecs composites and became widely used in military and commercial applications for electronic deployment and operation  state of the art rackmount cases are now also constructed of thermo stamped composite  carbon fiber and dupont s kevlar for demanding military and commercial uses     originally  the mounting holes were tapped with a particular screw thread  when rack rails are too thin to tap  rivnuts or other threaded inserts can be used  and when the particular class of equipment to be mounted is known in advance  some of the holes can be omitted from the mounting rails      threaded mounting holes in racks where the equipment is frequently changed are problematic because the threads can be damaged or the mounting screws can break off  both problems render the mounting hole unusable  tapping large numbers of holes that may never be used is expensive  nonetheless tapped hole racks are still in use  generally for hardware that rarely changes  examples include telephone exchanges  network cabling panels  broadcast studios and some government and military applications     the tapped hole rack was first replaced by clearance hole  round hole  round unthreaded holes   and versa rail   racks  the holes are large enough to permit a bolt to be freely inserted through without binding  and bolts are fastened in place using cage nuts  in the event of a nut being stripped out or a bolt breaking  the nut can be easily removed and replaced with a new one  production of clearance hole racks is less expensive because tapping the holes is eliminated and replaced with fewer  less expensive  cage nuts     the next innovation in rack design has been the square hole rack  square hole racks allow boltless mounting  such that the rack mount equipment only needs to insert through and hook down into the lip of the square hole  installation and removal of hardware in a square hole rack is very easy and boltless  where the weight of the equipment and small retention clips are all that is necessary to hold the equipment in place  older equipment meant for round hole or tapped hole racks can still be used  with the use of cage nuts made for square hole racks     rack mountable equipment is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack  within the it industry  it s common for network communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions  including table top and wall mounting  so rack mountable equipment will often feature l brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a    inch rack  with the prevalence of    inch racks in the telecoms industry  the same practice is also common  but with equipment having    inch and    inch brackets available  enabling them to be mounted in existing racks     a key structural weakness of front mounted support is the shear stress placed on the mounting rails and the leading edge of the equipment  as a result    post racks have become common  with such racks featuring a mirrored pair of rear mounting posts  since the spacing between the front and rear mounting posts may differ between rack vendors and or the configuration of the rack  some racks may incorporate front and rear rails that may be moved forwards and backwards  i e  apc sx range racks   it s common for equipment that features   post mounting brackets  to have an adjustable rear bracket     servers and deep pieces of equipment are often mounted using rails that are bolted to the front and rear posts  as above  it s common for such rails to have an adjustable depth   allowing the equipment to be supported by   posts  whilst also enabling it to be easily installed and removed     while there is no standard for the depth of equipment  nor specifying the outer width and depth of the rack enclosure itself  incorporating the structure  doors and panels that contain the mounting rails   there is a tendency for   post racks to be    xa mm or    xa mm wide  and for them to be    xa mm     xa mm or     xa mm deep  this of course varies by manufacturer  the design of the rack and its purpose  but through common constraining factors  such as raised floor tile dimensions   these dimensions have become quite common  the extra width and depth enables cabling to be routed with ease  also helping to maintain bend radius for fibre and copper cables  and deeper equipment to be utilised  a common feature in it racks are mounting positions for  zero u  accessories  such as pdu  power distribution units  and vertical cable managers ducts  that utilise the space between the rear rails and the side of the rack enclosure     the strength required of the mounting posts means they are invariably not merely flat strips but actually a wider folded strip arranged around the corner of the rack  the posts are usually made of steel of around  xa mm thickness  the official standard recommends a minimum of    xa mm   or of slightly thicker aluminum     racks  especially two post racks  are often secured to the floor or adjacent building structure so as not to fall over  this is usually required by local building codes in seismic zones  according to telcordia technologies generic requirements document gr    core  during an earthquake  telecommunications equipment is subjected to motions that can over stress equipment framework  circuit boards  and connectors  the amount of motion and resulting stress depends on the structural characteristics of the building and framework in which the equipment is contained  and the severity of the earthquake  seismic racks rated according to gr     nebs requirements  physical protection  are available   with zone   representing the most demanding environment      gr       generic requirements for network equipment in the outside plant  osp   specifies the usable opening of seismic compliant    inch racks     heavy equipment or equipment which is commonly accessed for servicing  for which attaching or detaching at all four corners simultaneously would pose a problem  is often not mounted directly onto the rack but instead is mounted via rails  or slides   a pair of rails is mounted directly onto the rack  and the equipment then slides into the rack along the rails  which support it  when in place  the equipment may also then be bolted to the rack  the rails may also be able to fully support the equipment in a position where it has been slid clear of the rack  this is useful for inspection or maintenance of equipment which will then be slid back into the rack    some rack slides even include a tilt mechanism allowing easy access to the top or bottom of rack mounted equipment when it is fully extended from the rack       slides or rails for computers and other data processing equipment such as disk arrays or routers often need to be purchased directly from the equipment manufacturer  as there is no standardization on such equipment s thickness  measurement from the side of the rack to the equipment  or means for mounting to the rail     a rails kit may include a cable management arm  or cma   which folds the cables attached to the server and allows them to expand neatly when the server is slid out  without being disconnected     computer servers designed for rack mounting can include a number of extra features to make the server easy to use in the rack     when there is a large number of computers in a single rack  it is impractical for each one to have its own separate keyboard  mouse  and monitor  instead  a kvm switch or lom software is used to share a single keyboard video mouse set amongst many different computers     since the mounting hole arrangement is vertically symmetric  it is possible to mount rack mountable equipment upside down  however  not all equipment is suitable for this type of mounting  for instance  most optical disc players will not work upside down because the driving motor mechanism does not grip the disc     racks are available with either four or two vertical posts  four post racks allow for mounting rails to support the equipment at the front and rear  these racks may be open in construction  similar to the traditional open style two post racks   or may be enclosed by front and or rear doors  side panels  or tops    two post racks provide just two vertical posts  a piece of equipment can be mounted either via its front panel holes  or close to its center of gravity  to minimize load on its front panel   depending on the design of the rack  two post racks are most often used for telecommunication installations     the formal standards for a    inch       xa mm  rack are available from the following     a rack s mounting fixture consists of two parallel metal strips  also referred to as  posts  or  panel mounts   standing vertically  the posts are each       inches       xa mm  wide  and are separated by a gap of       inches        xa mm   giving an overall rack width of    inches        xa mm   the posts have holes in them at regular intervals  with both posts matching  so that each hole is part of a horizontal pair with a center to center distance of        inches        xa mm        the holes in the posts are arranged vertically in repeating sets of three  with center to center separations of     inches       xa mm         inches       xa mm         inches       xa mm   the hole pattern thus repeats every      inches       xa mm      holes so arranged can either be tapped  usually       unf thread  or  less often   mm metric  or have square holes for cage nuts     racks are divided into regions       inches       xa mm  in height  within which there are three complete hole pairs in a vertically symmetric pattern  the holes being centered      inches      xa mm         inches       xa mm   and     inches       xa mm  from the top or bottom of the region  such a region is commonly known as a u  for  unit   or in german  he   for h heneinheit  and heights within racks are measured by this unit  rack mountable equipment is usually designed to occupy some integer number of u  for example  an oscilloscope might be  u high  and rack mountable computers are mostly between  u and  u high  a blade server enclosure might require   u     occasionally  one may see fractional u devices such as a    u server  but these are much less common     u servers have more airflow  less noise and better cooling than  u servers  and are still more space efficient than  u servers       the height of a rack can vary from a few inches  such as in a broadcast console  to a floor mounted rack whose interior is    rack units        inches or     centimetres  high  with   u being a common configuration  many wall mounted industrial equipment enclosures have    inch rack rails to support mounting of equipment     frames for holding rotary dial telephone equipment were generally    feet    inches high  a series of studies led to a switch to frames   feet high  with modular widths in multiples of   foot    inch most often   feet    inches wide       a    inch rack is used for housing telephone  primarily   computer  audio and other equipment though is less common than the    inch rack  the size notes the width of the faceplate for the installed equipment  the rack unit is a measure of vertical spacing and is common to both the    and    inch     xa mm  racks     hole spacing is either on   inch    xa mm  centres  western electric standard   or the same as for    inch     xa mm  racks        inches or      millimetres spacing      another name for this type of racks is etsi rack  relating to the european telecoms standards institute     open rack is a mounting system designed
