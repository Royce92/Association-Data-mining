 autonomic computing refers to the self managing characteristics of distributed computing resources  adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users  started by ibm in       this initiative ultimately aims to develop computer systems capable of self management  to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing systems management  and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth       the system makes decisions on its own  using high level policies  it will constantly check and optimize its status and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions  an autonomic computing framework is composed of autonomic components  ac  interacting with each other  an ac can be modeled in terms of two main control loops  local and global  with sensors  for self monitoring   effectors  for self adjustment   knowledge and planner adapter for exploiting policies based on self  and environment awareness     driven by such vision  a variety of architectural frameworks based on  self regulating  autonomic components has been recently proposed  a very similar trend has recently characterized significant research in the area of multi agent systems  however  most of these approaches are typically conceived with centralized or cluster based server architectures in mind and mostly address the need of reducing management costs rather than the need of enabling complex software systems or providing innovative services  some autonomic systems involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms      autonomy oriented computation is a paradigm proposed by jiming liu in      that uses artificial systems imitating social animals  collective behaviours to solve difficult computational problems  for example  ant colony optimization could be studied in this paradigm              forecasts suggest that the number of computing devices in use will grow at     per year  and the average complexity of each device is increasing   currently  this volume and complexity is managed by highly skilled humans  but the demand for skilled it personnel is already outstripping supply  with labour costs exceeding equipment costs by a ratio of up to        computing systems have brought great benefits of speed and automation but there is now an overwhelming economic need to automate their maintenance     in a      ieee computer magazine article  kephart and chess   warn that the dream of interconnectivity of computing systems and devices could become the  nightmare of pervasive computing  in which architects are unable to anticipate  design and maintain the complexity of interactions  they state the essence of autonomic computing is system self management  freeing administrators from low level task management while delivering better system behavior     a general problem of modern distributed computing systems is that their complexity  and in particular the complexity of their management  is becoming a significant limiting factor in their further development  large companies and institutions are employing large scale computer networks for communication and computation  the distributed applications running on these computer networks are diverse and deal with many tasks  ranging from internal control processes to presenting web content to customer support     additionally  mobile computing is pervading these networks at an increasing speed  employees need to communicate with their companies while they are not in their office  they do so by using laptops  personal digital assistants  or mobile phones with diverse forms of wireless technologies to access their companies  data     this creates an enormous complexity in the overall computer network which is hard to control manually by human operators  manual control is time consuming  expensive  and error prone  the manual effort needed to control a growing networked computer system tends to increase very quickly         of such problems in infrastructure happen at the client specific application and database layer citation needed most  autonomic  service providerswho  guarantee only up to the basic plumbing layer  power  hardware  operating system  network and basic database parameters      a possible solution could be to enable modern  networked computing systems to manage themselves without direct human intervention  the autonomic computing initiative  aci  aims at providing the foundation for autonomic systems  it is inspired by the autonomic nervous system of the human body  this nervous system controls important bodily functions  e g  respiration  heart rate  and blood pressure  without any conscious intervention     in a self managing autonomic system  the human operator takes on a new role  instead of controlling the system directly  he she defines general policies and rules that guide the self management process  for this process  ibm defined the following four types of property referred to as self star  also called self    self x  or auto    properties       others such as poslad   and nami and bertel   have expanded on the set of self star as follows     ibm defined five evolutionary levels  or the autonomic deployment model  for its deployment  level   is the basic level that presents the current situation where systems are essentially managed manually  levels       introduce increasingly automated management functions  while level   represents the ultimate goal of autonomic  self managing systems     the design complexity of autonomic systems can be simplified by utilizing design patterns such as the model view controller  mvc  pattern to improve concern separation by encapsulating functional concerns      a basic concept that will be applied in autonomic systems are closed control loops  this well known concept stems from process control theory  essentially  a closed control loop in a self managing system monitors some resource  software or hardware component  and autonomously tries to keep its parameters within a desired range     according to ibm  hundreds or even thousands of these control loops are expected to work in a large scale self managing computer system     a fundamental building block of an autonomic system is the sensing capability  sensors si   which enables the system to observe its external operational context  inherent to an autonomic system is the knowledge of the purpose  intention  and the know how to operate itself  e g   bootstrapping  configuration knowledge  interpretation of sensory data  etc   without external intervention  the actual operation of the autonomic system is dictated by the logic  which is responsible for making the right decisions to serve its purpose  and influence by the observation of the operational context  based on the sensor input      this model highlights the fact that the operation of an autonomic system is purpose driven  this includes its mission  e g   the service it is supposed to offer   the policies  e g   that define the basic behaviour   and the  survival instinct   if seen as a control system this would be encoded as a feedback error function or in a heuristically assisted system as an algorithm combined with set of heuristics bounding its operational space     even though the purpose and thus the behaviour of autonomic systems vary from system to system  every autonomic system should be able to exhibit a minimum set of properties to achieve its purpose     ibm has set forth eight conditions that define an autonomic system
