 cloud foundry is an open source cloud computing platform as a service  paas  originally developed by vmware and now owned by pivotal software   a joint venture by emc  vmware and general electric  cloud foundry was designed and developed by a small team from google led by derek collison and was originally called project b       cloud foundry was also a java paas for amazon ec  founded by chris richardson in      and acquired by springsource in         the same month vmware acquired springsource   the current product is unrelated to the project under springsource  but the name was adopted when the original springsource project was end of life d  cloud foundry is primarily written in ruby and go     cloud foundry comes in three flavors     other companies also offer platform as a service products using the cloud foundry platform             cloud foundry supports the full lifecycle  from initial development  through all testing stages  to deployment  it is therefore well suited to the continuous delivery strategy  users have access to one or more spaces  which typically correspond to a lifecycle stages  for example  an application ready for qa testing might be pushed  deployed  to its project s qa space  different users can be restricted to different spaces with different access permissions in each     developers require an additional tool  the cloud foundry cf command line interface  it is written in go  installers exist for ms windows  macos  and linux     the cf utility provides many options  but for deployment cf push is all that is required  it accepts arguments to specify the name of the application  where to load it from and the url that should be used to access it  for example     pushes the java web application spring music  two instances are deployed  this is a java web application so by default this is two tomcat instances   each with    m of memory  the url ends with spring music v  and the web archive  application  can be found at build libs spring music war  every cloud foundry instance manages one or more domains  for example all pivotal web services  pws  applications are accessed via the cfapps io domain  so if this spring music application had been deployed to pws  its url would have been http   spring music v  cfapps io     when an application is deployed to cloud foundry  an image is created for it and stored internally  the image is then deployed to a warden container to run in  for multiple instances  multiple images are started on multiple containers  this is where bosh comes in   cloud foundry s internal controller uses bosh to get the underlying infrastructure to spin up virtual machines to run the warden containers on  when an application is terminated  all its vms can be recycled for another application to use  if the application instance crashes  its container is killed and a new warden container is started automatically  a container only ever runs one application ensuring isolation  security and resilience     a load balancing router sits at the front of cloud foundry to route incoming requests to the correct application   essentially to one of the containers where the application is running     applications deployed to cloud foundry access external resources via services  in a paas environment  all external dependencies such as databases  messaging systems  files systems and so on are services  when an application is pushed to cloud foundry  you can specify the services it should use also  depending on the application language  auto configuration of services is possible   for example a java application requiring a mysql database picks up the mysql service on cloud foundry if it is the only one defined in the current space     services have to be deployed to the platform first and then are available to any application using it  another advantage of pivotal cf is that many pre defined services can be deployed into it directly using the administration console  users of the open source cloud foundry must make services available by writing and running bosh scripts     pws provides a large number of services thanks to a partnership arrangement with app direct     the following services are available to pivotal cf and on pws     although cloud foundry is a pivotal product  its direction is controlled by a foundation  similar to rackspace and openstack     by mid          companies had signed up to the foundation       the source code is under an apache     license  and contributions are governed by the cloud foundry contributors  licenses for individuals and corporations  these licenses grant both copyright and patent access and protection to the cloud foundry foundation  which is the same model that vmware followed with the spring framework from springsource     supported runtimes and frameworks include         typically  cloud foundry is installed on premise running over vmware s vsphere virtualization infrastructure  although deployment to openstack is an option using bosh       it is also possible to run cloud foundry instances on vmware fusion or virtualbox using vagrant and on aws       official website
