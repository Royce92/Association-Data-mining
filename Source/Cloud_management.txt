 cloud management is the management of cloud computing products and services     public clouds are managed by public cloud service providers  which include the public cloud environment s servers  storage  networking and data center operations   users of public cloud services can generally select from three basic categories     managing a private cloud requires software tools to help create a virtualized pool of compute resources  provide a self service portal for end users and handle security  resource allocation  tracking and billing   management tools for private clouds tend to be service driven  as opposed to resource driven  because cloud environments are typically highly virtualized and organized in terms of portable workloads      in hybrid cloud environments  compute  network and storage resources must be managed across multiple domains  so a good management strategy should start by defining what needs to be managed  and where and how to do it   policies to help govern these domains should include configuration and installation of images  access control  and budgeting and reporting   access control often includes the use of single sign on  sso   in which a user logs in once and gains access to all systems without being prompted to log in again at each of them             a cloud management system combines software and technologies in a design for managing cloud environments   software developers have responded to the management challenges of cloud computing with cloud management systems   hp  novell  eucalyptus  opennebula and citrix  for example  sell management systems specifically for managing cloud environments      at a minimum  a cloud management system should have the ability to      for composite applications  cloud management systems also encompass frameworks for workflow mapping and  management      enterprises with large scale cloud implementations may require more robust cloud management tools which include specific characteristics  such as the ability to manage multiple platforms from a single point of reference  or intelligent analytics to automate processes like application lifecycle management  high end cloud management tools shouldoriginal research  also have the ability to handle system failures automatically with capabilities such as self monitoring  an explicit notification mechanism  and include failover and self healing capabilities  cisco recentlywhen  launched its intercloud solution to provide flexibility to dynamically manage workloads across public and private cloud environments      the concept of a cloud management platform  cmp  has emerged      legacy management infrastructures  which are based on the concept of dedicated system relationships and architecture constructs  are not well suited to cloud environments where instances are continually launched and decommissioned   instead  the dynamic nature of cloud computing requires monitoring and management tools that are adaptable  extensible and customizable         cloud computing presents a number of management challenges   companies using public clouds do not have ownership of the equipment hosting the cloud environment  and because the environment is not contained within their own networks  public cloud customers do not have full visibility or control    users of public cloud services must also integrate with an architecture defined by the cloud provider  using its specific parameters for working with cloud components  integration includes tying into the cloud apis for configuring ip addresses  subnets  firewalls and data service functions for storage  because control of these functions is based on the cloud provider s infrastructure and services  public cloud users must integrate with the cloud infrastructure management       capacity management is a challenge for both public and private cloud environments because end users have the ability to deploy applications using self service portals  applications of all sizes may appear in the environment  consume an unpredictable amount of resources  then disappear at any time       chargeback or  pricing resource use on a granular basis is a challenge for both public and private cloud environments    chargeback is a challenge for public cloud service providers because they must price their services competitively while still creating profit    users of public cloud services may find chargeback challenging because it is difficult for it groups to assess actual resource costs on a granular basis due to overlapping resources within an organization that may be paid for by an individual business unit  such as electrical power    for private cloud operators  chargeback is fairly straightforward  but the challenge lies in guessing how to allocate resources as closely as possible to actual resource usage to achieve the greatest operational efficiency  exceeding budgets can be a risk       hybrid cloud environments  which combine public and private cloud services  sometimes with traditional infrastructure elements  present their own set of management challenges  these include security concerns if sensitive data lands on public cloud servers  budget concerns around overuse of storage or bandwidth and proliferation of mismanaged images   managing the information flow in a hybrid cloud environment is also a significant challenge  on premises clouds must share information with applications hosted off premises by public cloud providers  and this information may change constantly    hybrid cloud environments also typically include a complex mix of policies  permissions and limits that must be managed consistently across both public and private clouds       like any other brokerage firm  a cloud services brokerage  csb  manages cloud services for clients  gartner explains that csbs play an intermediary role in the cloud computing management process    cloud services brokerages consolidate cloud services from one or more sources and allow customers to access these services through one portal
