 pumped storage hydroelectricity  psh  is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing  the method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water  pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation  low cost off peak electric power is used to run the pumps  during periods of high electrical demand  the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power  although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall  the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand  when electricity prices are highest     pumped storage is the largest capacity form of grid energy storage available  and  as of march       the electric power research institute  epri  reports that psh accounts for more than     of bulk storage capacity worldwide  representing around         mw   psh reported energy efficiency varies in practice between     and          with some claiming up to                  at times of low electrical demand  excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir  when there is higher demand  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine  generating electricity  reversible turbine generator assemblies act as pump and turbine  usually a francis turbine design   nearly all facilities use the height difference between two natural bodies of water or artificial reservoirs  pure pumped storage plants just shift the water between reservoirs  while the  pump back  approach is a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants that use natural stream flow  plants that do not use pumped storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants  conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage  by deferring output until needed     taking into account evaporation losses from the exposed water surface and conversion losses  energy recovery of     or more can be regained   the technique is currently the most cost effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy on an operating basis  but capital costs and the presence of appropriate geography are critical decision factors     the relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either a very large body of water or a large variation in height  for example       kilograms of water    cubic meter  at the top of a     meter tower has a potential energy of about       kw h  capable of raising the temperature of the same amount of water by only      celsius        fahrenheit   the only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located on a hill relatively near  but as high as possible above  a second body of water  in some places this occurs naturally  in others one or both bodies of water have been man made  projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural waterways are involved are commonly referred to as  closed loop      this system may be economical because it flattens out load variations on the power grid  permitting thermal power stations such as coal fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency  base load power plants   while reducing the need for  peaking  power plants that use the same fuels as many baseload thermal plants  gas and oil  but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal thermal efficiency  however  capital costs for purpose built hydrostorage are relatively high     along with energy management  pumped storage systems help control electrical network frequency and provide reserve generation  thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand  potentially causing frequency and voltage instability  pumped storage plants  like other hydroelectric plants  can respond to load changes within seconds     the first use of pumped storage was in the     s in italy and switzerland  in the     s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available  these turbines could operate as both turbine generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps  the latest in large scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency  these machines generate in synchronization with the network frequency  but operate asynchronously  independent of the network frequency  as motor pumps     the first use of pumped storage in the united states was in      by the connecticut electric and power company  using a large reservoir located near new milford  connecticut  pumping water from the housatonic river to the storage reservoir     feet above      the important use for pumped storage is to level the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources  the pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand  enabling additional system peak capacity  in certain jurisdictions  electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative  ontario in early september         on occasions that there is more electrical generation than load available to absorb it  although at present this is rarely due to wind alone  increased wind generation may increase the likelihood of such occurrences  it is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation      in       world pumped storage generating capacity was     gw   while other sources claim     gw  which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage    the eu had      gw net capacity        of world capacity  out of a total of     gw of hydropower and representing    of total net electrical capacity in the eu  japan had      gw net capacity        of world capacity       in      the united states had      gw of pumped storage generating capacity        of world capacity     phs generated  net         gwh of energy in      in the us   because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated     the five largest operational pumped storage plants are listed below  for a detailed list see list of pumped storage hydroelectric power stations      the use of underground reservoirs has been investigated  recent examples include the proposed summit project in norton  ohio  the proposed maysville project in kentucky  underground limestone mine   and the mount hope project in new jersey  which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir  several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed  cost per kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space  there are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space  but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may expanded if abandoned coal mines prove suitable     a new concept is to use wind turbines or solar power to drive water pumps directly  in effect an  energy storing wind or solar dam   this could provide a more efficient process and usefully smooth out the variability of energy captured from the wind or sun            one can use pumped sea water to store the energy  the    mw yanbaru project in okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage  a     mw seawater based project has recently been proposed on lanai  hawaii  and several seawater based projects have recently been proposed in ireland  another potential example of this could be used in a tidal barrage or tidal lagoon  a potential benefit of this arises if seawater is allowed to flow behind the barrage or into the lagoon at high tide when the water level is roughly equal either side of the barrier  when the potential energy difference is close to zero  then water is released at low tide when a head of water has been built up behind the barrier  when there is a far greater potential energy difference between the two bodies of water  the result being that when the energy used to pump the water is recovered  it will have multiplied to a degree depending on the head of water built up  a further enhancement is to pump more water at high tide further increasing the head with for example intermittent renewables    two downsides are that the generator must be below sea level  and that marine organisms would tend to grow on the equipment and disrupt operation  this is not a major problem for the edf la rance tidal power station in france citation needed    small pumped storage hydropower plants can be built on streams and within infrastructures  such as drinking water networks and artificial snow making infrastructures  such plants provide distributed energy storage and distributed flexible electricity production and can contribute to the decentralized integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies  such as wind power and solar power  reservoirs that can be used for small pumped storage hydropower plants could include    natural or artificial lakes  reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation  or unused portions of mines or underground military installations  in switzerland one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped storage hydropower plants in      could be increased by   to   times by providing adequate policy instruments
