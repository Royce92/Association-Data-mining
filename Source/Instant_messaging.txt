 instant messaging  im  is a type of online chat which offers real time text transmission over the internet  a lan messenger operates in a similar way over a local area network  short messages are typically transmitted bi directionally between two parties  when each user chooses to complete a thought and select  send   some im applications can use push technology to provide real time text  which transmits messages character by character  as they are composed  more advanced instant messaging can add file transfer  clickable hyperlinks  voice over ip  or video chat     non im types of chat include multicast transmission  usually referred to as  chat rooms   where participants might be anonymous or might be previously known to each other  for example collaborators on a project that is using chat to facilitate communication   instant messaging systems tend to facilitate connections between specified known users  often using a contact list also known as a  buddy list  or  friend list    depending on the im protocol  the technical architecture can be peer to peer  direct point to point transmission  or client server  a central server retransmits messages from the sender to the communication device              instant messaging is a set of communication technologies used for text based communication between two or more participants over the internet or other types of networks  im chat happens in real time  of importance is that online chat and instant messaging differ from other technologies such as email due to the perceived quasi synchrony of the communications by the users  some systems permit messages to be sent to users not then  logged on   offline messages   thus removing some differences between im and email  often done by sending the message to the associated email account      im allows effective and efficient communication  allowing immediate receipt of acknowledgment or reply  however im is basically not necessarily supported by transaction control  in many cases  instant messaging includes added features which can make it even more popular  for example  users may see each other via webcams  or talk directly for free over the internet using a microphone and headphones or loudspeakers  many applications allow file transfers  although they are usually limited in the permissible file size     it is usually possible to save a text conversation for later reference  instant messages are often logged in a local message history  making it similar to the persistent nature of emails     though the term dates from the     s  instant messaging predates the internet  first appearing on multi user operating systems like compatible time sharing system  ctss  and multiplexed information and computing service  multics   in the mid     s  initially  some of these systems were used as notification systems for services like printing  but quickly were used to facilitate communication with other users logged into the same machine  as networks developed  the protocols spread with the networks  some of these used a peer to peer protocol  e g  talk  ntalk and ytalk   while others required peers to connect to a server  see talker and irc   the zephyr notification service  still in use at some institutions  was invented at mit s project athena in the     s to allow service providers to locate and send messages to users     parallel to instant messaging were early online chat facilities  the earliest of which was talkomatic        on the plato system  during the bulletin board system  bbs  phenomenon that peaked during the     s  some systems incorporated chat features which were similar to instant messaging  freelancin  roundtable was one prime example  the first  such general availability commercial online chat service  as opposed to plato  which was educational  was the compuserve cb simulator in        created by compuserve executive alexander  sandy  trevor in columbus  ohio     early instant messaging programs were primarily real time text  where characters appeared as they were typed  this includes the unix  talk  command line program  which was popular in the     s and early     s  some bbs chat programs  i e  celerity bbs  also used a similar interface  modern implementations of real time text also exist in instant messengers  such as aol s real time im  as an optional feature      in the latter half of the     s and into the early     s  the quantum link online service for commodore    computers offered user to user messages between concurrently connected customers  which they called  on line messages   or olm for short   and later  flashmail    quantum link later became america online and made aol instant messenger  aim   discussed later   while the quantum link client software ran on a commodore     using only the commodore s petscii text graphics  the screen was visually divided into sections and olms would appear as a yellow bar saying  message from   and the name of the sender along with the message across the top of whatever the user was already doing  and presented a list of options for responding   as such  it could be considered a type of graphical user interface  gui   albeit much more primitive than the later unix  windows and macintosh based gui im software  olms were what q link called  plus services  meaning they charged an extra per minute fee on top of the monthly q link access costs     modern  internet wide  gui based messaging clients as they are known today  began to take off in the mid     s with powwow  icq  and aol instant messenger  similar functionality was offered by cu seeme in       though primarily an audio video chat link  users could also send textual messages to each other  aol later acquired mirabilis  the authors of icq  a few years later icq  now owned by aol  was awarded two patents for instant messaging by the u s  patent office  meanwhile  other companies developed their own software   excite  msn  ubique  and yahoo    each with its own proprietary protocol and client  users therefore had to run multiple client applications if they wished to use more than one of these networks  in       ibm released ibm lotus sametime  a product based on technology acquired when ibm bought haifa based ubique and lexington based databeam     in       an open source application and open standards based protocol called jabber was launched  the protocol was standardized under the name extensible messaging and presence protocol  xmpp   xmpp servers could act as gateways to other im protocols  reducing the need to run multiple clients  multi protocol clients can use any of the popular im protocols by using additional local libraries for each protocol  ibm lotus sametime s november      release added ibm lotus sametime gateway support for xmpp     as of       social networking providers often offer im abilities  facebook chat is a form of instant messaging  and twitter can be thought of as a web     instant messaging system     many instant messaging services offer video calling features  voice over ip and web conferencing services  web conferencing services can integrate both video calling and instant messaging abilities  some instant messaging companies are also offering desktop sharing  ip radio  and iptv to the voice and video features     the term  instant messenger  is a service mark of time warner  and may not be used in software not affiliated with aol in the united states  for this reason  in april       the instant messaging client formerly named gaim  or gaim  announced that they would be renamed  pidgin       each modern im service generally provides its own client  either a separately installed piece of software  or a browser based client  these usually only work with the supplier company s service  although some allow limited function with other services  third party client software applications exist that will connect with most of the major im services  adium  empathy  miranda im  pidgin  qnext and trillian are a few of the common ones     standard complementary instant messaging applications offer functions like file transfer  contact list s   the ability to hold several simultaneous conversations  etc  these may be all the functions that a small business needs  but larger organizations will require more sophisticated applications that can work together  the solution to finding applications capable of this is to use enterprise versions of instant messaging applications  these include titles like xmpp  lotus sametime  microsoft office communicator  etc   which are often integrated with other enterprise applications such as workflow systems  these enterprise applications  or enterprise application integration  eai   are built to certain constraints  namely storing data in a common format     there have been several attempts to create a unified standard for instant messaging  ietf s session initiation protocol  sip  and sip for instant messaging and presence leveraging extensions  simple   application exchange  apex   instant messaging and presence protocol  impp   the open xml based extensible messaging and presence protocol  xmpp   and open mobile alliance s instant messaging and presence service developed specifically for mobile devices     most attempts at producing a unified standard for the major im providers  aol  yahoo  and microsoft  have failed  and each continues to use its own proprietary protocol     however  while discussions at ietf were stalled  reuters signed the first inter service provider connectivity agreement on september       this agreement enabled aim  icq and msn messenger users to talk with reuters messaging counterparts and vice versa  following this  microsoft  yahoo  and aol agreed to a deal in which microsoft s live communications server      users would also have the possibility to talk to public instant messaging users  this deal established sip simple as a standard for protocol interoperability and established a connectivity fee for accessing public instant messaging groups or services  separately  on october           microsoft and yahoo  announced that by the  rd quarter of      they would interoperate using sip simple  which was followed  in december       by the aol and google strategic partnership deal in which google talk users would be able to communicate with aim and icq users provided they have an aim account     there are two ways to combine the many disparate protocols     some approaches allow organizations to deploy their own  private instant messaging network by enabling them to restrict access to the server  often with the im network entirely behind their firewall  and administer user permissions  other corporate messaging systems allow registered users to also connect from outside the corporation lan  by using an encrypted  firewall friendly  https based protocol  usually  a dedicated corporate im server has several advantages  such as pre populated contact lists  integrated authentication  and better security and privacy     certain networks have made changes to prevent them from being used by such multi network im clients  for example  trillian had to release several revisions and patches to allow its users to access the msn  aol  and yahoo  networks  after changes were made to these networks  the major im providers usually cite the need for formal agreements  and security concerns as reasons for making these changes     the use of proprietary protocols has meant that many instant messaging networks have been incompatible and users have been unable to reach users on other networks  this may have allowed social networking with im like features and text messaging an opportunity to gain market share at the expense of im      users sometimes make use of internet slang or text speak to abbreviate common words or expressions to quicken conversations or reduce keystrokes  the language has become widespread  with well known expressions such as  lol  translated over to face to face language     emotions are often expressed in shorthand  such as the abbreviation lol  brb and ttyl  respectively laugh ing  out loud  be right back  and talk to you later     some  however  attempt to be more accurate with emotional expression over im  real time reactions such as  chortle   snort   guffaw  or  eye roll  are becoming more popular  also there are certain standards that are being introduced into mainstream conversations including      indicates the use of sarcasm in a statement and     which indicates a spelling mistake and or grammatical error in the prior message  followed by a correction       instant messaging has proven to be similar to personal computers  email  and the world wide web  in that its adoption for use as a business communications medium was driven primarily by individual employees using consumer software at work  rather than by formal mandate or provisioning by corporate information technology departments  tens of millions of the consumer im accounts in use are being used for business purposes by employees of companies and other organizations     in response to the demand for business grade im and the need to ensure security and legal compliance  a new type of instant messaging  called  enterprise instant messaging    eim   was created when lotus software launched ibm lotus sametime in       microsoft followed suit shortly thereafter with microsoft exchange instant messaging  later created a new platform called microsoft office live communications server  and released office communications server      in october       oracle corporation has also jumped into the market recently with its oracle beehive unified collaboration software    both ibm lotus and microsoft have introduced federation between their eim systems and some of the public im networks so that employees may use one interface to both their internal eim system and their contacts on aol  msn  and yahoo  as of       leading eim platforms include ibm lotus sametime  microsoft office communications server  jabber xcp and cisco unified presence  industry focused eim platforms as reuters messaging and bloomberg messaging also provide enhanced im abilities to financial services companies     the adoption of im across corporate networks outside of the control of it organizations creates risks and liabilities for companies who do not effectively manage and support im use  companies implement specialized im archiving and security products and services to mitigate these risks and provide safe  secure  productive instant messaging abilities to their employees  im is increasingly becoming a feature of enterprise software rather than a stand alone application     im products can usually be categorised into two types  enterprise instant messaging  eim    and consumer instant messaging  cim     enterprise solutions use an internal im server  however this isn t always feasible  particularly for smaller businesses with limited budgets  the second option  using a cim provides the advantage of being inexpensive to implement and has little need for investing in new hardware or server software     for corporate use  encryption and conversation archiving are usually regarded as important features due to security concerns  sometimes the use of different operating systems in organizations requires use of software that supports more than one platform  for example many software companies use windows in administration departments but have software developers who use linux     crackers  malicious  hacker  or black hat hacker  have consistently used im networks as vectors for delivering phishing attempts   poison urls   and virus laden file attachments from      to the present  with over      discrete attacks listed by the im security center   in            hackers use two methods of delivering malicious code through im  delivery of viruses  trojan horses  or spyware within an infected file  and the use of  socially engineered  text with a web address that entices the recipient to click on a url connecting him or her to a website that then downloads malicious code  viruses  computer worms  and trojans usually propagate by sending themselves rapidly through the infected user s contact list  an effective attack using a poisoned url may reach tens of thousands of users in a short period when each user s contact list receives messages appearing to be from a trusted friend  the recipients click on the web address  and the entire cycle starts again  infections may range from nuisance to criminal  and are becoming more sophisticated each year     im connections usually occur in plain text  making them vulnerable to eavesdropping  also  im client software often requires the user to expose open udp ports to the world  raising the threat posed by potential security vulnerabilities       in addition to the malicious code threat  the use of instant messaging at work also creates a risk of non compliance to laws and regulations governing use of electronic communications in businesses  in the united states alone there are over        laws and regulations related to electronic messaging and records retention    the better known of these include the sarbanes oxley act  hipaa  and sec   a    clarification from the financial industry regulatory authority  finra  was issued to member firms in the financial services industry in december        noting that  electronic communications    email   and  electronic correspondence  may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging    changes to federal rules of civil procedure  effective december          created a new category for electronic records which may be requested during discovery in legal proceedings  most nations also regulate use of electronic messaging and electronic records retention in similar fashion as the united states  the most common regulations related to im at work involve the need to produce archived business communications to satisfy government or judicial requests under law  many instant messaging communications fall into the category of business communications that must be archived and retrievable     in the early     s  a new class of it security provider emerged to provide remedies for the risks and liabilities faced by corporations who chose to use im for business communications  the im security providers created new products to be installed in corporate networks for the purpose of archiving  content scanning  and security scanning im traffic moving in and out of the corporation  similar to the e mail filtering vendors  the im security providers focus on the risks and liabilities described above     with rapid adoption of im in the workplace  demand for im security products began to grow in the mid     s  by       the preferred platform for the purchase of security software had become the  computer appliance   according to idc  who estimate that by           of network security products will be delivered via an appliance       by      however  the level of safety offered by instant messengers was still extremely poor  according to the eff security review  only   out of    instant messengers had a perfect score  namely chatsecure  cryptocat  signal redphone  silent phone  silent text and textsecure  whereas the most popular instant messengers at this time  whatsapp  snapchat  facebook chat and hangouts only attain a score of   out of    skype even just attained a number of   out of           while some numbers are given by the owners of a complete instant messaging system  others are provided by commercial vendors of a part of a distributed system  some companies may be motivated to inflate their numbers to raise advertising earnings or attract partners  clients  or customers  importantly  some numbers are reported as the number of active users  with no shared standard of that activity   others indicate total user accounts  while others indicate only the users logged in during an instance of peak use     since the acquisitions of      and later and with the wide availability of smartphones  the virtual communities of those conglomerates are becoming the user base of most instant messaging services
