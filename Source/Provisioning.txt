 in telecommunication  provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide  new  services to its users  in national security emergency preparedness telecommunications services   provisioning  equates to  initiation  and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability      the concept of network provisioning or service mediation  mostly used in the telecommunication industry  refers to the provisioning of the customer s services to the network elements clarification needed it requires the existence of networking equipment and depends on network planning and design     in a modern signal infrastructure employing information technology  it  at all levels  there is no possible distinction between telecommunications services and  higher level  infrastructure citation needed accordingly  provisioning configures any required systems  provides users with access to data and technology resources  and refers to all enterprise level information resource management involved     organizationally  a cio typically manages provisioning  necessarily involving human resources and it departments cooperating to     as its core  the provisioning process monitors access rights and privileges to ensure the security of an enterprise s resources and user privacy  as a secondary responsibility  it ensures compliance and minimizes the vulnerability of systems to penetration and abuse  as a tertiary responsibility  it tries to reduce the amount of custom configuration using boot image control and other methods that radically reduce the number of different configurations involved     discussion of provisioning often appears in the context of virtualization  orchestration  utility computing  cloud computing  and open configuration concepts and projects  for instance  the oasis provisioning services technical committee  pstc  defines an xml based framework for exchanging user  resource  and service provisioning information   spml  service provisioning markup language  for  managing the provisioning and allocation of identity information and system resources within and between organizations citation needed     once provisioning has taken place  the process of sysopping ensures the maintenance of services to the expected standards  provisioning thus refers only to the setup or startup part of the service operation  and sysopping to the ongoing support             the services which are assigned to the customer in the customer relationship management  crm  have to be provisioned on the network element which is enabling the service and allows the customer to actually use the service  the relation between a service configured in the crm and a service on the network elements is not necessarily a     relation  some services can be enabled by more than one network element  e g  the microsoft media server  mms     service     during the provisioning  the service mediation device translates the service and the corresponding parameters of the service to one or more services parameters on the network elements involved  the algorithm used to translate a system service into network services is called provisioning logic     electronic invoice feeds from your carriers can be automatically downloaded directly into the core of the telecom expense management  tem  software and it will immediately conduct an audit of each single line item charge all the way down to the user support and operations center  usoc  level  the provisioning software will capture each circuit number provided by all of your carriers and if bills outside of the contracted rate an exception rule will trigger a red flag and notify the pre established staff member to review the billing error     server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems  data and software  and make it ready for network operation  typical tasks when provisioning a server are  select a server from a pool of available servers  load the appropriate software  operating system  device drivers  middleware  and applications   appropriately customize and configure the system and the software to create or change a boot image for this server  and then change its parameters  such as ip address  ip gateway to find associated network and storage resources  sometimes separated as resource provisioning  to audit the system  by auditing the system  you ensure oval compliance with limit vulnerability  ensure compliance  or install patches  after these actions  you restart the system and load the new software  this makes the system ready for operation  typically an internet service provider  isp  or network operations center will perform these tasks to a well defined set of parameters  for example  a boot image that the organization has approved and which uses software it has license to  many instances of such a boot image create a virtual dedicated host     there are many software products available to automate the provisioning of servers  services and end user devices  examples  hp server automation  ibm tivoli provisioning manager  redhat kickstart  xcat  hp insight cmu  etc  middleware and applications can be installed either when the operating system is installed or afterwards by using an application service automation tool  further questions are addressed in academia such as when provisioning should be issued and how many servers are needed in multi tier   or multi service applications      in cloud computing servers may be provisioned via a web user interface or an application programming interface  one of the unique things about cloud computing is how rapidly and easily this can be done  monitoring software can be used to trigger automatic provisioning when existing resources become too heavily stressed      in short  server provisioning configures servers based on resource requirements  the use of a hardware or software component  e g  single dual processor  ram  hdd  raid controller  a number of lan cards  applications  os  etc   depends on the functionality of the server  such as isp  virtualization  nos  or voice processing  server redundancy depends on the availability of servers in the organization  critical applications have less downtime when using cluster servers  raid  or a mirroring system     service used by most larger scale centers in part to avoid this  additional resource provisioning may be done per service      user provisioning refers to the creation  maintenance and deactivation of user objects and user attributes  as they exist in one or more systems  directories or applications  in response to automated or interactive business processes  user provisioning software may include one or more of the following processes  change propagation  self service workflow  consolidated user administration  delegated user administration  and federated change control  user objects may represent employees  contractors  vendors  partners  customers or other recipients of a service  services may include electronic mail  inclusion in a published user directory  access to a database  access to a network or mainframe  etc  user provisioning is a type of identity management software  particularly useful within organizations  where users may be represented by multiple objects on multiple systems     on demand self service is described by the national institute of standards and technology  nist  as an essential characteristic of cloud computing   the self service nature of cloud computing lets end users obtain and remove cloud services including applications  the infrastructure supporting the applications   and configuration   themselves without requiring the assistance of an it staff member   the automatic self servicing may target different application goals and constraints  e g  deadlines and cost       as well as handling different application architectures  e g   bags of tasks and workflows     cloud users can obtain cloud services through a cloud service catalog or a self service portal    because business users can obtain and configure cloud services themselves  this means it staff can be more productive and gives them more time to manage cloud infrastructures       however one problem of cloud service provisioning is that it is not instantaneous  a cloud vm can be acquired at any time by the user  but it may take up to several minutes for the acquired vm to be ready to use  the vm startup time is dependent on factors  such as image size  vm type  data center location  number of vms  etc    cloud providers have different vm startup performance     mobile subscriber provisioning refers to the setting up of new services  such as gprs  mms and instant messaging for an existing subscriber of a mobile phone network  and any gateways to standard internet chat or mail services  the network operator typically sends these settings to the subscriber s handset using sms text services or html  and less commonly wap  depending on what the mobile operating systems can accept     a general example of provisioning is with data services  a mobile user who is using his or her device for voice calling may wish to switch to data services in order to read emails or browse the internet  the mobile device s services are  provisioned  and thus the user is able to stay connected through push emails and other features of smartphone services     device management systems can benefit end users by incorporating plug and play data services  supporting whatever device the end user is using citation needed  such a platform can automatically detect devices in the network  sending them settings for immediate and continued usability citation needed the process is fully automated  keeping the history of used devices and sending settings only to subscriber devices which were not previously set  one method of managing mobile updates is to filter imei imsi pairs citation needed some operators report activity of    over the air settings update files per second citation needed    this refers to delivering mobile content  such as mobile internet to a mobile phone  agnostic of the features of said device  these may include operating system type and versions  java version  browser version  screen form factors  audio capabilities  language settings and a plethora of other characteristics  as of april       an estimated      permutations are relevant  mobile content provisioning facilitates a common user experience  though delivered on widely different handsets     when getting a user   customer online  beyond user provisioning and network provisioning  the client system must be configured  this process may include many steps  depending on the connection technology in question  dsl  cable  fibre  etc    the possible steps are     there are four approaches to provisioning an internet access     customer provisioning at dmoz    identity provisioning    database provisioning
