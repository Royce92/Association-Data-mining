 mobile computing is human computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage  mobile computing involves mobile communication  mobile hardware  and mobile software  communication issues include ad hoc and infrastructure networks as well as communication properties  protocols  data formats and concrete technologies  hardware includes mobile devices or device components  mobile software deals with the characteristics and requirements of mobile applications             mobile computing is  taking a computer and all necessary files and software out into the field    there are several different dimensions under which mobile computers can be defined      in terms of physical dimensions      in terms of how devices may be hosted      in terms of when the mobility occurs      in terms of how devices are networked      in terms of the type of computing that is performed       in terms of dimensions  mobile computers tend to be planar and tend to range in size from centimeters to decimeters  mobile computer may themselves be mobile  e g   it is embedded into a robot or vehicle that is mobile or itself may not be mobile  but is carried by a mobile host  e g   the mobile phone is not mobile but it is carried by a mobile human  the most flexible mobile computer is one that can move during its operation or user session but this depends in part on the range of any wireless network it is connected to  a tablet or laptop computer connected via wi fi can move while staying connected within the range of its wlan transmitter  to move between multiple different located wlans  the device must interrupt  suspend  or close its current user session before connecting to another wlan transmitter in another session  a device such as a tablet or mobile phone can move much further while staying connected within the range of a gsm network as it can seamlessly move between multiple gsm transmitters or base stations  mobile computers may also support or form part of a more local network that moves as the devices  i e   mobile computers may also be used as part of a wireless body area network wireless personal area network or a piconet  depending on the type of application the mobile computer runs  the computation of the applications may run only locally  e g   a pc game  the majority of mobile computers for personal use tends to be used for communication or for remote data downloads such as remote web access  see mobile internet device   as some mobile computers contain an array of sensors  microphones and cameras  these can be used for local data capture  filtering tagging and remote uploads  increasing mobile computers are also being used to access services such as travel  payment or for access to controlled physical spaces     some of the most common forms of mobile computing devices are as follows     the existence of these classes is expected to be long lasting  and complementary in personal usage  none replacing one the other in all features of convenience     other types of mobile computers have been introduced since the     s including the     many commercial and government field forces deploy a ruggedized portable computer with their fleet of vehicles  this requires the units to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety  device security  and ergonomics  rugged computers are rated for severe vibration associated with large service vehicles and off road driving and the harsh environmental conditions of constant professional use such as in emergency medical services  fire  and public safety     other elements affecting function in vehicle     several specialized manufacturers such as first mobile technologies  national products inc  ram mounts   gamber johnson and havis  formerly ledco  build mounts for vehicle mounting of computer equipment for a wide range of vehicles  the mounts are built to withstand the harsh conditions and maintain ergonomics     specialized installation companies design the mount design  assembling the parts  and installing them in a safe and consistent manner away from airbags  vehicle hvac controls  and driver controls  frequently installations will include a wwan modem  power conditioning equipment  transceiver antennae mounted external to the vehicle  and wwan wlan gps etc     mobile security or mobile phone security has become increasingly important in mobile computing  it is of particular concern as it relates to the security of personal information now stored on the smartphone     more and more users and businesses use smartphones as communication tools but also as a means of planning and organizing their work and private life  within companies  these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks  indeed  smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company     all smartphones  as computers  are preferred targets of attacks  these attacks exploit weaknesses related to smartphones that can come from means of communication like sms  mms  wifi networks  and gsm  there are also attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities from both the web browser and operating system  finally  there are forms of malicious software that rely on the weak knowledge of average users     different security counter measures are being developed and applied to smartphones  from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users  there are good practices to be observed at all levels  from design to use  through the development of operating systems  software layers  and downloadable apps     several categories of portable computing devices can run on batteries but are not usually classified as laptops  portable computers  pdas  ultra mobile pcs  umpcs   tablets and smartphones     boundaries that separate these categories are blurry at times  for example  the oqo umpc is also a pda sized tablet pc  the apple emate had the clamshell form factor of a laptop  but ran pda software  the hp omnibook line of laptops included some devices small more enough to be called ultra mobile pcs  the hardware of the nokia     internet tablet is essentially the same as that of a pda such as the zaurus       the only reason it s not called a pda is that it does not have pim software  on the other hand  both the     and the zaurus can run some desktop linux software  usually with modifications     wireless data connections used in mobile computing take three general forms so   cellular data service uses technologies such as gsm  cdma or gprs   g networks such as w cdma  edge or cdma         and more recently  g networks such as lte  lte advanced    these networks are usually available within range of commercial cell towers  wi fi connections offer higher performance    may be either on a private business network or accessed through public hotspots  and have a typical range of     feet indoors and up to      feet outdoors    satellite internet access covers areas where cellular and wi fi are not available   and may be set up anywhere the user has a line of sight to the satellite s location    which for satellites in geostationary orbit means having an unobstructed view of the southern sky   some enterprise deployments combine networks from multiple cellular networks or use a mix of cellular  wi fi and satellite    when using a mix of networks  a mobile virtual private network  mobile vpn  not only handles the security concerns  but also performs the multiple network logins automatically and keeps the application connections alive to prevent crashes or data loss during network transitions or coverage loss
