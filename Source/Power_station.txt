 a power station  also referred to as a generating station  power plant  powerhouse or generating plant  is an industrial facility for the generation of electric power     each power station contains one or more generators  a rotating machine that converts mechanical power into electrical power by creating relative motion between a magnetic field and a conductor  the energy source harnessed to turn the generator varies widely  most power stations in the world burn fossil fuels such as coal  oil  and natural gas to generate electricity  and some use nuclear power  but there is an increasing use of cleaner renewable sources such as solar  wind  wave and hydroelectric             the world s first power station was designed and built by lord armstrong at cragside  england in       water from one of the lakes was used to power siemens dynamos  the electricity supplied power to lights  heating  produced hot water  ran an elevator as well as labor saving devices and farm buildings       the first public power station was the edison electric light station  built in london at     holborn viaduct  which started operation in january       this was a project of thomas edison that was organized and managed by his partner  edward johnson  a babcock and wilcox boiler powered a     horsepower steam engine that drove a    ton generator called jumbo  after the celebrated elephant  this supplied electricity to premises in the area that could be reached through the culverts of the viaduct without digging up the road  which was the monopoly of the gas companies  the customers included the city temple and the old bailey  another important customer was the telegraph office of the general post office  but this could not be reached though the culverts  johnson arranged for the supply cable to be run overhead  via holborn tavern and newgate      in september      in new york  the pearl street station was established by edison to provide electric lighting in the lower manhattan island area  the station ran until destroyed by fire in       the station used reciprocating steam engines to turn direct current generators  because of the dc distribution  the service area was small  limited by voltage drop in the feeders  the war of currents eventually resolved in favor of ac distribution and utilization  although some dc systems persisted to the end of the   th century  dc systems with a service radius of a mile  kilometer  or so were necessarily smaller  less efficient of fuel consumption  and more labor intensive to operate than much larger central ac generating stations     ac systems used a wide range of frequencies depending on the type of load  lighting load using higher frequencies  and traction systems and heavy motor load systems preferring lower frequencies  the economics of central station generation improved greatly when unified light and power systems  operating at a common frequency  were developed  the same generating plant that fed large industrial loads during the day  could feed commuter railway systems during rush hour and then serve lighting load in the evening  thus improving the system load factor and reducing the cost of electrical energy overall  many exceptions existed  generating stations were dedicated to power or light by the choice of frequency  and rotating frequency changers and rotating converters were particularly common to feed electric railway systems from the general lighting and power network     throughout the first few decades of the   th century central stations became larger  using higher steam pressures to provide greater efficiency  and relying on interconnections of multiple generating stations to improve reliability and cost  high voltage ac transmission allowed hydroelectric power to be conveniently moved from distant waterfalls to city markets  the advent of the steam turbine in central station service  around       allowed great expansion of generating capacity  generators were no longer limited by the power transmission of belts or the relatively slow speed of reciprocating engines  and could grow to enormous sizes  for example  sebastian ziani de ferranti planned what would have been the largest reciprocating steam engine ever built for a proposed new central station  but scrapped the plans when turbines became available in the necessary size  building power systems out of central stations required combinations of engineering skill and financial acumen in equal measure  pioneers of central station generation include george westinghouse and samuel insull in the united states  ferranti and charles hesterman merz in uk  and many others     in thermal power stations  mechanical power is produced by a heat engine that transforms thermal energy  often from combustion of a fuel  into rotational energy  most thermal power stations produce steam  so they are sometimes called steam power stations  not all thermal energy can be transformed into mechanical power  according to the second law of thermodynamics  therefore  there is always heat lost to the environment  if this loss is employed as useful heat  for industrial processes or district heating  the power plant is referred to as a cogeneration power plant or chp  combined heat and power  plant  in countries where district heating is common  there are dedicated heat plants called heat only boiler stations  an important class of power stations in the middle east uses by product heat for the desalination of water     the efficiency of a steam turbine is limited by the maximum steam temperature produced  the efficiency is not directly a function of the fuel used  for the same steam conditions  coal   nuclear  and gas power plants all have the same theoretical efficiency  overall  if a system is on constantly  base load  it will be more efficient than one that is used intermittently  peak load   steam turbines generally operate at higher efficiency when operated at full capacity     besides use of reject heat for process or district heating  one way to improve overall efficiency of a power plant is to combine two different thermodynamic cycles  most commonly  exhaust gases from a gas turbine are used to generate steam for a boiler and a steam turbine  the combination of a  top  cycle and a  bottom  cycle produces higher overall efficiency than either cycle can attain alone     power plants that can be dispatched  scheduled  to provide energy to a system include     non dispatchable plants include such sources as wind and solar energy  while their long term contribution to system energy supply is predictable  on a short term  daily or hourly  base their energy must be used as available since generation cannot be deferred  contractual arrangements    take or pay   with independent power producers or system interconnections to other networks may be effectively non dispatchable     all thermal power plants produce waste heat energy as a byproduct of the useful electrical energy produced  the amount of waste heat energy equals or exceeds the amount of energy converted into useful electricity  gas fired power plants can achieve as much as     conversion efficiency  while coal and oil plants achieve around         the waste heat produces a temperature rise in the atmosphere  which is small compared to that produced by greenhouse gas emissions from the same power plant  natural draft wet cooling towers at many nuclear power plants and large fossil fuel fired power plants use large hyperboloid chimney like structures  as seen in the image at the right  that release the waste heat to the ambient atmosphere by the evaporation of water     however  the mechanical induced draft or forced draft wet cooling towers in many large thermal power plants  nuclear power plants  fossil fired power plants  petroleum refineries  petrochemical plants  geothermal  biomass and waste to energy plants use fans to provide air movement upward through downcoming water  and are not hyperboloid chimney like structures  the induced or forced draft cooling towers are typically rectangular  box like structures filled with a material that enhances the mixing of the upflowing air and the downflowing water         in areas with restricted water use  a dry cooling tower or directly air cooled radiators may be necessary  since the cost or environmental consequences of obtaining make up water for evaporative cooling would be prohibitive  these coolers have lower efficiency and higher energy consumption to drive fans  compared to a typical wet  evaporative cooling tower     where economically and environmentally possible  electric companies prefer to use cooling water from the ocean  a lake  or a river  or a cooling pond  instead of a cooling tower  this type of cooling can save the cost of a cooling tower and may have lower energy costs for pumping cooling water through the plant s heat exchangers  however  the waste heat can cause the temperature of the water to rise detectably  power plants using natural bodies of water for cooling must be designed to prevent intake of organisms into the cooling machinery  a further environmental impact is that aquatic organisms which adapt to the warmer discharge water may be injured if the plant shuts down in cold weather     water consumption by power stations is a developing issue       in recent years  recycled wastewater  or grey water  has been used in cooling towers  the calpine riverside and the calpine fox power stations in wisconsin as well as the calpine mankato power station in minnesota are among these facilities     power stations can also generate electrical energy from renewable energy sources     dams built to produce hydroelectricity impound a reservoir of water and release it through one or more water turbines  connected to generators  and generate electricity  from the energy provided by difference in water level upstream and downstream  hydropower is produced in     countries  with the asia pacific region generating    percent of global hydropower in       china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with     terawatt hours of production in       representing around    percent of domestic electricity use     a pumped storage hydroelectric power plant is a net consumer of energy but can be used to smooth peaks and troughs in overall electricity demand  pumped storage plants typically use  spare  electricity during off peak periods to pump water from a lower reservoir or dam to an upper reservoir  because the electricity is consumed  off peak  it is typically cheaper than power at peak times  this is because the  base load  power stations  which are typically coal fired  cannot be switched on and off quickly so remain in service even when demand is low  during hours of peak demand  when the electricity price is high  the water pumped to the high reservoir is allowed to flow back to the lower reservoir through a water turbine connected to an electricity generator  unlike coal power stations  which can take more than    hours to start up from cold  the hydroelectric plant can be brought into service in a few minutes  ideal to meet a peak load demand  two substantial pumped storage schemes are in south africa  one to the east of cape town  palmiet  and one in the drakensberg  natal    solar energy can be turned into electricity either directly in solar cells  or in a concentrating solar power plant by focusing the light to run a heat engine     a solar photovoltaic power plant converts sunlight into direct current electricity using the photoelectric effect  inverters change the direct current into alternating current for connection to the electrical grid  this type of plant does not use rotating machines for energy conversion     solar thermal power plants are another type of solar power plant  they use either parabolic troughs or heliostats to direct sunlight onto a pipe containing a heat transfer fluid  such as oil  the heated oil is then used to boil water into steam  which turns a turbine that drives an electrical generator  the central tower type of solar thermal power plant uses hundreds or thousands of mirrors  depending on size  to direct sunlight onto a receiver on top of a tower  again  the heat is used to produce steam to turn turbines that drive electrical generators     wind turbines can be used to generate electricity in areas with strong  steady winds  sometimes offshore  many different designs have been used in the past  but almost all modern turbines being produced today use a three bladed  upwind design  grid connected wind turbines now being built are much larger than the units installed during the     s  they thus produce power more cheaply and reliably than earlier models  with larger turbines  on the order of one megawatt   the blades move more slowly than older  smaller  units  which makes them less visually distracting and safer for airborne animals     marine energy or marine power  also sometimes referred to as ocean energy or ocean power  refers to the energy carried by ocean waves  tides  salinity  and ocean temperature differences  the movement of water in the world s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy  or energy in motion  this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes  transport and industries     the term marine energy encompasses both wave power   power from surface waves  and tidal power   obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water  offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy  as wind power is derived from the wind  even if the wind turbines are placed over water     the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations  ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world       salinity gradient energy is called pressure retarded osmosis  in this method  seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water  freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane  which increases both the volume and pressure of the chamber  as the pressure differences are compensated  a turbine is spun creating energy  this method is being specifically studied by the norwegian utility statkraft  which has calculated that up to    twh yr would be available from this process in norway  statkraft has built the world s first prototype osmotic power plant on the oslo fiord which was opened on november              biomass energy can be produced from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine  bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in gasification  pyrolysis or torrefaction reactions  depending on the desired end product  these reactions create more energy dense products  syngas  wood pellets  biocoal  that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity at a much lower emission rate when compared with open burning     the power generated by a power station is measured in multiples of the watt  typically megawatts      watts  or gigawatts      watts   power stations vary greatly in capacity depending on the type of power plant and on historical  geographical and economic factors  the following examples offer a sense of the scale     many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the usa  as of       the roscoe wind farm is the second largest onshore wind farm in the world  producing       mw of power  followed by the horse hollow wind energy center        mw   as of july       the london array in united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at     mw  followed by thanet offshore wind project in united kingdom at     mw     as of april       the largest photovoltaic  pv  power plants in the world are led by india s gujarat solar park rated at     megawatts  a planned installation in china will produce      megawatts at peak       solar thermal power stations in the u s  have the following output     large coal fired  nuclear  and hydroelectric power stations can generate hundreds of megawatts to multiple gigawatts  some examples     gas turbine power plants can generate tens to hundreds of megawatts  some examples     the rated capacity of a power station is nearly the maximum electrical power that that power station can produce  some power plants are run at almost exactly their rated capacity all the time  as a non load following base load power plant  except at times of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance     however  many power plants usually produce much less power than their rated capacity     in some cases a power plant produces much less power than its rated capacity because it uses an intermittent energy source  operators try to pull maximum available power from such power plants  because their marginal cost is practically zero  but the available power varies widely in particular  it may be zero during heavy storms at night     in some cases operators deliberately produce less power for economic reasons  the cost of fuel to run a load following power plant may be relatively high  and the cost of fuel to run a peaking power plant is even higher they have relatively high marginal costs  operators keep power plants turned off   operational reserve   or running at minimum fuel consumptioncitation needed   spinning reserve   most of the time  operators feed more fuel into load following power plants only when the demand rises above what lower cost plants  i e   intermittent and base load plants  can produce  and then feed more fuel into peaking power plants only when the demand rises faster than the load following power plants can follow     the power station operator has several duties in the electricity generating facility  operators are responsible for the safety of the work crews that frequently do repairs on the mechanical and electrical equipment  they maintain the equipment with periodic inspections and log temperatures  pressures and other important information at regular intervals  operators are responsible for starting and stopping  the generators depending on need  they are able to synchronize and adjust the voltage output of the added generation with the running electrical system  without upsetting the system  they must know the electrical and mechanical systems in order to troubleshoot solve fix problems in the facility and add to the reliability of the facility  operators must be able to respond to an emergency and know the procedures in place to deal with it
