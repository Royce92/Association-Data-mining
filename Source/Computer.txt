 a computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically  since a sequence of operations can be readily changed  the computer can solve more than one kind of problem     conventionally  a computer consists of at least one processing element  typically a central processing unit  cpu   and some form of memory  the processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations  and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information  peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source  and the result of operations saved and retrieved     mechanical analog computers started appearing in first century and were later used in the medieval era for astronomical calculations  in world war ii  mechanical analog computers were used for specialized military applications  during this time the first electronic digital computers were developed  originally they were the size of a large room  consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers  pcs       modern computers based on integrated circuits are millions to billions of times more capable than the early machines  and occupy a fraction of the space   simple computers are small enough to fit into mobile devices  and mobile computers can be powered by small batteries  personal computers in their various forms are icons of the information age and are what most people think of as  computers   however  the embedded computers found in many devices from mp  players to fighter aircraft and from toys to industrial robots are the most numerous             the first use of the word  computer  was recorded in      in a book called  the yong mans gleanings  by english writer richard braithwait i haue read the truest computer of times  and the best arithmetician that euer breathed  and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number  it referred to a person who carried out calculations  or computations  and the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the   th century  from the end of the   th century the word began to take on its more familiar meaning  a machine that carries out computations      devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years  mostly using one to one correspondence with fingers  the earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick  later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi  clay spheres  cones  etc   which represented counts of items  probably livestock or grains  sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers    the use of counting rods is one example     the abacus was early used for arithmetic tasks  what we now call the roman abacus was used in babylonia as early as      bc  since then  many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented  in a medieval european counting house  a checkered cloth would be placed on a table  and markers moved around on it according to certain rules  as an aid to calculating sums of money     the antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog  computer   according to derek j  de solla price   it was designed to calculate astronomical positions  it was discovered in      in the antikythera wreck off the greek island of antikythera  between kythera and crete  and has been dated to circa     bc  devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later     many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use  the planisphere was a star chart invented by ab  rayh n al b r n  in the early   th century   the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the  st or  nd centuries bc and is often attributed to hipparchus  a combination of the planisphere and dioptra  the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy  an astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer   and gear wheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan  persia in         ab  rayh n al b r n  invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe    an early fixed wired knowledge processing machine   with a gear train and gear wheels    circa      ad     the sector  a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion  trigonometry  multiplication and division  and for various functions  such as squares and cube roots  was developed in the late   th century and found application in gunnery  surveying and navigation     the planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage     the slide rule was invented around            shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm  it is a hand operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division  as slide rule development progressed  added scales provided reciprocals  squares and square roots  cubes and cube roots  as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials  circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions  aviation is one of the few fields where slide rules are still in widespread use  particularly for solving time distance problems in light aircraft  to save space and for ease of reading  these are typically circular devices rather than the classic linear slide rule shape  a popular example is the e b     in the     s pierre jaquet droz  a swiss watchmaker  built a mechanical doll  automata  that could write holding a quill pen  by switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters  and hence different messages  could be produced  in effect  it could be mechanically  programmed  to read instructions  along with two other complex machines  the doll is at the mus e d art et d histoire of neuch tel  switzerland  and still operates       the tide predicting machine invented by sir william thomson in      was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters  it used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location     the differential analyser  a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration  used wheel and disc mechanisms to perform the integration  in      lord kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators  but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball and disk integrators    in a differential analyzer  the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator  or a graphing output  the torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work  starting in the     s  vannevar bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers     charles babbage  an english mechanical engineer and polymath  originated the concept of a programmable computer  considered the  father of the computer     he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early   th century  after working on his revolutionary difference engine  designed to aid in navigational calculations  in      he realized that a much more general design  an analytical engine  was possible  the input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards  a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the jacquard loom  for output  the machine would have a printer  a curve plotter and a bell  the machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later  the engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit  control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops  and integrated memory  making it the first design for a general purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as turing complete         the machine was about a century ahead of its time  all the parts for his machine had to be made by hand   this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts  eventually  the project was dissolved with the decision of the british government to cease funding  babbage s failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing  but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow  nevertheless his son  henry babbage  completed a simplified version of the analytical engine s computing unit  the mill  in       he gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in          during the first half of the   th century  many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers  which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation  however  these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers       the first modern analog computer was a tide predicting machine  invented by sir william thomson in       the differential analyser  a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel and disc mechanisms  was conceptualized in      by james thomson  the brother of the more famous lord kelvin       the art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer  built by h  l  hazen and vannevar bush at mit starting in       this built on the mechanical integrators of james thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by h  w  nieman  a dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious     by the     s the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines  but analog computers remain in use in some specialized applications such as education  control systems  and aircraft  slide rule      the principle of the modern computer was first described by computer scientist alan turing  who set out the idea in his seminal      paper    on computable numbers  turing reformulated kurt g del s      results on the limits of proof and computation  replacing g del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as turing machines  he proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm  he went on to prove that there was no solution to the entscheidungsproblem by first showing that the halting problem for turing machines is undecidable  in general  it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given turing machine will ever halt     he also introduced the notion of a  universal machine   now known as a universal turing machine   with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine  or in other words  it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape  allowing the machine to be programmable  von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper    turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation  except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores  modern computers are said to be turing complete  which is to say  they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal turing machine     by      the united states navy had developed an electromechanical analog computer small enough to use aboard a submarine  this was the torpedo data computer  which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo from a boat to a moving target  during world war ii similar devices were developed in other countries as well     early digital computers were electromechanical  electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation  these devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all electric computers  originally using vacuum tubes  the z   created by german engineer konrad zuse in       was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer       in       zuse followed his earlier machine up with the z   the world s first working electromechanical programmable  fully automatic digital computer      the z  was built with      relays  implementing a   xa bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about     xa hz    program code and data were stored on punched film  it was quite similar to modern machines in some respects  pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers  replacement of the hard to implement decimal system  used in charles babbage s earlier design  by the simpler binary system meant that zuse s machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable  given the technologies available at that time    the z  was probably a complete turing machine     purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical and electromechanical equivalents  at the same time that digital calculation replaced analog  the engineer tommy flowers  working at the post office research station in london in the     s  began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange  experimental equipment that he built in      went into operation   years later  converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system  using thousands of vacuum tubes    in the us  john vincent atanasoff and clifford e  berry of iowa state university developed and tested the atanasoff berry computer  abc  in         the first  automatic electronic digital computer     this design was also all electronic and used about     vacuum tubes  with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory       during world war ii  the british at bletchley park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted german military communications  the german encryption machine  enigma  was first attacked with the help of the electro mechanical bombes  to crack the more sophisticated german lorenz sz       machine  used for high level army communications  max newman and his colleagues commissioned flowers to build the colossus    he spent eleven months from early february      designing and building the first colossus    after a functional test in december       colossus was shipped to bletchley park  where it was delivered on    january        and attacked its first message on   february       colossus was the world s first electronic digital programmable computer    it used a large number of valves  vacuum tubes   it had paper tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data  but it was not turing complete  nine mk ii colossi were built  the mk i was converted to a mk ii making ten machines in total   colossus mark i contained      thermionic valves  tubes   but mark ii with      valves  was both   times faster and simpler to operate than mark    greatly speeding the decoding process         the us built eniac    electronic numerical integrator and computer  was the first electronic programmable computer built in the us  although the eniac was similar to the colossus it was much faster and more flexible  it was unambiguously a turing complete device and could compute any problem that would fit into its memory  like the colossus  a  program  on the eniac was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches  a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later  once a program was written  it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches     it combined the high speed of electronics with the ability to be programmed for many complex problems  it could add or subtract      times a second  a thousand times faster than any other machine  it also had modules to multiply  divide  and square root  high speed memory was limited to    words  about    bytes   built under the direction of john mauchly and j  presper eckert at the university of pennsylvania  eniac s development and construction lasted from      to full operation at the end of       the machine was huge  weighing    tons  using     kilowatts of electric power and contained over        vacuum tubes        relays  and hundreds of thousands of resistors  capacitors  and inductors       early computing machines had fixed programs  changing its function required the re wiring and re structuring of the machine    with the proposal of the stored program computer this changed  a stored program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions  a program  that details the computation  the theoretical basis for the stored program computer was laid by alan turing in his      paper  in      turing joined the national physical laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored program digital computer  his      report  proposed electronic calculator  was the first specification for such a device  john von neumann at the university of pennsylvania  also circulated his first draft of a report on the edvac in            the manchester small scale experimental machine  nicknamed baby  was the world s first stored program computer  it was built at the victoria university of manchester by frederic c  williams  tom kilburn and geoff tootill  and ran its first program on   xa june         it was designed as a testbed for the williams tube the first random access digital storage device    although the computer was considered  small and primitive  by the standards of its time  it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer    as soon as the ssem had demonstrated the feasibility of its design  a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer  the manchester mark       the mark   in turn quickly became the prototype for the ferranti mark    the world s first commercially available general purpose computer    built by ferranti  it was delivered to the university of manchester in february       at least seven of these later machines were delivered between      and       one of them to shell labs in amsterdam    in october       the directors of british catering company j  lyons   company decided to take an active role in promoting the commercial development of computers  the leo i computer became operational in april         and ran the world s first regular routine office computer job     the bipolar transistor was invented in       from      onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs  giving rise to the  second generation  of computers  compared to vacuum tubes  transistors have many advantages  they are smaller  and require less power than vacuum tubes  so give off less heat  silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer  indefinite  service life  transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space     at the university of manchester  a team under the leadership of tom kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves    their first transistorised computer and the first in the world  was operational by       and a second version was completed there in april       however  the machine did make use of valves to generate its    xa khz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory  so it was not the first completely transistorized computer  that distinction goes to the harwell cadet of         built by the electronics division of the atomic energy research establishment at harwell         the next great advance in computing power came with the advent of the integrated circuit  the idea of the integrated circuit was first conceived by a radar scientist working for the royal radar establishment of the ministry of defence  geoffrey w a  dummer  dummer presented the first public description of an integrated circuit at the symposium on progress in quality electronic components in washington xa d c  on   may            the first practical ics were invented by jack kilby at texas instruments and robert noyce at fairchild semiconductor    kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in july       successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on    september         in his patent application of   february       kilby described his new device as  a body of semiconductor material     wherein all the components of the electronic circuit are completely integrated       noyce also came up with his own idea of an integrated circuit half a year later than kilby    his chip solved many practical problems that kilby s had not  produced at fairchild semiconductor  it was made of silicon  whereas kilby s chip was made of germanium     this new development heralded an explosion in the commercial and personal use of computers and led to the invention of the microprocessor  while the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious  partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term  microprocessor   it is largely undisputed that the first single chip microprocessor was the intel         designed and realized by ted hoff  federico faggin  and stanley mazor at intel       with the continued miniaturization of computing resources  and advancements in portable battery life  portable computers grew in popularity in the     s    the same developments that spurred the growth of laptop computers and other portable computers allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular phones  these so called smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and have became the dominant computing device on the market  with manufacturers reporting having shipped an estimated     million devices in  q            the defining feature of modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines is that they can be programmed  that is to say that some type of instructions  the program  can be given to the computer  and it will process them  modern computers based on the von neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language     in practical terms  a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions  as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example  a typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second  gigaflops  and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation  large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write  and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors     this section applies to most common ram machine based computers     in most cases  computer instructions are simple  add one number to another  move some data from one location to another  send a message to some external device  etc  these instructions are read from the computer s memory and are generally carried out  executed  in the order they were given  however  there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there  these are called  jump  instructions  or branches   furthermore  jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event  many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that  remembers  the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction     program execution might be likened to reading a book  while a person will normally read each word and line in sequence  they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest  similarly  a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met  this is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention     comparatively  a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses  but to add together all of the numbers from   to       would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time  with a near certainty of making a mistake  on the other hand  a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions  for example     once told to run this program  the computer will perform the repetitive addition task without further human intervention  it will almost never make a mistake and a modern pc can complete the task in about a millionth of a second       in most computers  individual instructions are stored as machine code with each instruction being given a unique number  its operation code or opcode for short   the command to add two numbers together would have one opcode  the command to multiply them would have a different opcode  and so on  the simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions  the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from  each with a unique numerical code  since the computer s memory is able to store numbers  it can also store the instruction codes  this leads to the important fact that entire programs  which are just lists of these instructions  can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data  the fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer s memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von neumann  or stored programcitation needed  architecture  in some cases  a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on  this is called the harvard architecture after the harvard mark i computer  modern von neumann computers display some traits of the harvard architecture in their designs  such as in cpu caches     while it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers  machine language  and while this technique was used with many early computers    it is extremely tedious and potentially error prone to do so in practice  especially for complicated programs  instead  each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to rememberxa   a mnemonic such as add  sub  mult or jump  these mnemonics are collectively known as a computer s assembly language  converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand  machine language  is usually done by a computer program called an assembler     programming languages provide various ways of specifying programs for computers to run  unlike natural languages  programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise  they are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud  they are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run  or translated directly at run time by an interpreter  sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques     machine languages and the assembly languages that represent them  collectively termed low level programming languages  tend to be unique to a particular type of computer  for instance  an arm architecture computer  such as may be found in a pda or a hand held videogame  cannot understand the machine language of an intel pentium or the amd athlon    computer that might be in a pc       though considerably easier than in machine language  writing long programs in assembly language is often difficult and is also error prone  therefore  most practical programs are written in more abstract high level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently  and thereby help reduce programmer error   high level languages are usually  compiled  into machine language  or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language  using another computer program called a compiler    high level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language  and more related to the language and structure of the problem s  to be solved by the final program  it is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer  this is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles     program design of small programs is relatively simple and involves the analysis of the problem  collection of inputs  using the programming constructs within languages  devising or using established procedures and algorithms  providing data for output devices and solutions to the problem as applicable  as problems become larger and more complex  features such as subprograms  modules  formal documentation  and new paradigms such as object oriented programming are encountered  large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies  the task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge  producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult  the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge     errors in computer programs are called  bugs   they may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program  or have only subtle effects  but in some cases  they may cause the program or the entire system to  hang   becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes  to completely fail  or to crash  otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit  code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer s proper execution  bugs are usually not the fault of the computer  since computers merely execute the instructions they are given  bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program s design       admiral grace hopper  an american computer scientist and developer of the first compiler  is credited for having first used the term  bugs  in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the harvard mark ii computer in september            a general purpose computer has four main components  the arithmetic logic unit  alu   the control unit  the memory  and the input and output devices  collectively termed i o   these parts are interconnected by buses  often made of groups of wires     inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch  each circuit represents a bit  binary digit  of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a      and when off it represents a      in positive logic representation   the circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits     the control unit  alu  and registers are collectively known as a central processing unit  cpu   early cpus were composed of many separate components but since the mid     s cpus have typically been constructed on a single integrated circuit called a microprocessor     the control unit  often called a control system or central controller  manages the computer s various components  it reads and interprets  decodes  the program instructions  transforming them into control signals that activate other parts of the computer    control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance     a key component common to all cpus is the program counter  a special memory cell  a register  that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from       the control system s function is as follows note that this is a simplified description  and some of these steps may be performed concurrently or in a different order depending on the type of cpu     since the program counter is  conceptually  just another set of memory cells  it can be changed by calculations done in the alu  adding     to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place     locations further down the program  instructions that modify the program counter are often known as  jumps  and allow for loops  instructions that are repeated by the computer  and often conditional instruction execution  both examples of control flow      the sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program  and indeed  in some more complex cpu designs  there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer  which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen     the alu is capable of performing two classes of operations  arithmetic and logic       the set of arithmetic operations that a particular alu supports may be limited to addition and subtraction  or might include multiplication  division  trigonometry functions such as sine  cosine  etc   and square roots  some can only operate on whole numbers  integers  whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers  albeit with limited precision  however  any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform  therefore  any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation although it will take more time to do so if its alu does not directly support the operation  an alu may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values  true or false  depending on whether one is equal to  greater than or less than the other   is    greater than           logic operations involve boolean logic  and  or  xor and not  these can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic     superscalar computers may contain multiple alus  allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously    graphics processors and computers with simd and mimd features often contain alus that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices     a computer s memory can be viewed as a list of cells into which numbers can be placed or read  each cell has a numbered  address  and can store a single number  the computer can be instructed to  put the number     into the cell numbered       or to  add the number that is in cell      to the number that is in cell      and put the answer into cell        the information stored in memory may represent practically anything  letters  numbers  even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease  since the cpu does not differentiate between different types of information  it is the software s responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers     in almost all modern computers  each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits  called a byte   each byte is able to represent     different numbers   ^          either from   to     or      to       to store larger numbers  several consecutive bytes may be used  typically  two  four or eight   when negative numbers are required  they are usually stored in two s complement notation  other arrangements are possible  but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts  a computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically  modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory     the cpu contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area  there are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of cpu  registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed  as data is constantly being worked on  reducing the need to access main memory  which is often slow compared to the alu and control units  greatly increases the computer s speed     computer main memory comes in two principal varieties  random access memory or ram and read only memory or rom  ram can be read and written to anytime the cpu commands it  but rom is preloaded with data and software that never changes  therefore the cpu can only read from it  rom is typically used to store the computer s initial start up instructions  in general  the contents of ram are erased when the power to the computer is turned off  but rom retains its data indefinitely  in a pc  the rom contains a specialized program called the bios that orchestrates loading the computer s operating system from the hard disk drive into ram whenever the computer is turned on or reset  in embedded computers  which frequently do not have disk drives  all of the required software may be stored in rom  software stored in rom is often called firmware  because it is notionally more like hardware than software  flash memory blurs the distinction between rom and ram  as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable  it is typically much slower than conventional rom and ram however  so its use is restricted to applications where high speed is unnecessary       in more sophisticated computers there may be one or more ram cache memories  which are slower than registers but faster than main memory  generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically  often without the need for any intervention on the programmer s part     i o is the means by which a computer exchanges information with the outside world    devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals    on a typical personal computer  peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse  and output devices such as the display and printer  hard disk drives  floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices  computer networking is another form of i o     i o devices are often complex computers in their own right  with their own cpu and memory  a graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display  d graphics citation needed modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main cpu in performing i o     while a computer may be viewed as running one gigantic program stored in its main memory  in some systems it is necessary to give the appearance of running several programs simultaneously  this is achieved by multitasking i e  having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn       one means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt  which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead  by remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt  the computer can return to that task later  if several programs are running  at the same time   then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second  causing a program switch each time  since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception  it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant  this method of multitasking is sometimes termed  time sharing  since each program is allocated a  slice  of time in turn       before the era of cheap computers  the principal use for multitasking was to allow many people to share the same computer     seemingly  multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly  in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running  but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input output devices to complete their tasks  if a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard  then it will not take a  time slice  until the event it is waiting for has occurred  this frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss     some computers are designed to distribute their work across several cpus in a multiprocessing configuration  a technique once employed only in large and powerful machines such as supercomputers  mainframe computers and servers  multiprocessor and multi core  multiple cpus on a single integrated circuit  personal and laptop computers are now widely available  and are being increasingly used in lower end markets as a result     supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored program architecture and from general purpose computers    they often feature thousands of cpus  customized high speed interconnects  and specialized computing hardware  such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once  supercomputers usually see usage in large scale simulation  graphics rendering  and cryptography applications  as well as with other so called  embarrassingly parallel  tasks     computers have been used to coordinate information between multiple locations since the     s  the u s  military s sage system was the first large scale example of such a system  which led to a number of special purpose commercial systems such as sabre       in the     s  computer engineers at research institutions throughout the united states began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology  the effort was funded by arpa  now darpa   and the computer network that resulted was called the arpanet    the technologies that made the arpanet possible spread and evolved     in time  the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the internet  the emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer  computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network  such as peripheral devices  stored information  and the like  as extensions of the resources of an individual computer  initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high tech environments  but in the     s the spread of applications like e mail and the world wide web  combined with the development of cheap  fast networking technologies like ethernet and adsl saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous  in fact  the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally  a very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the internet to communicate and receive information   wireless  networking  often utilizing mobile phone networks  has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments     there are many types of computer architectures     of all these abstract machines  a quantum computer holds the most promise for revolutionizing computing       logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms     the ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile  distinguishing them from calculators  the church turing thesis is a mathematical statement of this versatility  any computer with a minimum capability  being turing complete  is  in principle  capable of performing the same tasks that any other computer can perform  therefore any type of computer  netbook  supercomputer  cellular automaton  etc   is able to perform the same computational tasks  given enough time and storage capacity     a computer does not need to be electronic  nor even have a processor  nor ram  nor even a hard disk  while popular usage of the word  computer  is synonymous with a personal electronic computer  the modern   definition of a computer is literally  a device that computes  especially a programmable usually electronic machine that performs high speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles  stores  correlates  or otherwise processes information     any device which processes information qualifies as a computer  especially if the processing is purposeful  even a human is a computer  in this sense     historically  computers evolved from mechanical computers and eventually from vacuum tubes to transistors  however  conceptually computational systems as flexible as a personal computer can be built out of almost anything  for example  a computer can be made out of billiard balls  billiard ball computer   an often quoted example citation needed more realistically  modern computers are made out of transistors made of photolithographed semiconductors     there is active research to make computers out of many promising new types of technology  such as optical computers  dna computers  neural computers  and quantum computers  most computers are universal  and are able to calculate any computable function  and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed  however different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems  for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms  by quantum factoring  very quickly     a computer will solve problems in exactly the way it is programmed to  without regard to efficiency  alternative solutions  possible shortcuts  or possible errors in the code  computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning     the term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible objects  circuits  displays  power supplies  cables  keyboards  printers and mice are all hardware     software refers to parts of the computer which do not have a material form  such as programs  data  protocols  etc  when software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified  such as bios rom in an ibm pc compatible   it is sometimes called  firmware      there are thousands of different programming languages some intended to be general purpose  others useful only for highly specialized applications     as the use of computers has spread throughout society  there are an increasing number of careers involving computers     the need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations  clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature
