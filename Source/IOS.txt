        d      marchxa             days agoxa                     ios  originally iphone os  is a mobile operating system developed by apple inc  and distributed exclusively for apple hardware  it is the operating system that presently powers all of the company s idevices     originally unveiled in      for the iphone  it has been extended to support other apple devices such as the ipod touch  september        ipad  january        ipad mini  november       and second generation apple tv onward  september        as of january     update  apple s app store contained more than     million ios applications          of which are native for ipad   these apps have collectively been downloaded more than   xa billion times   it had a     share of the smartphone mobile operating system units shipped in the fourth quarter of       behind google s android    by the middle of       there were     million devices activated    at wwdc       tim cook said    xa million devices had been sold by june            the user interface of ios is based on the concept of direct manipulation  using multi touch gestures  interface control elements consist of sliders  switches  and buttons  interaction with the os includes gestures such as swipe  tap  pinch  and reverse pinch  all of which have specific definitions within the context of the ios operating system and its multi touch interface  internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device  one common result is the undo command  or rotating it in three dimensions  one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode      ios shares with os x some frameworks such as core foundation and foundation  however  its ui toolkit is cocoa touch rather than os x s cocoa  so that it provides the uikit framework rather than the appkit framework  it is therefore not compatible with os x for applications  also while ios also shares the darwin foundation with os x  unix like shell access is not available for users and restricted for apps  making ios not fully unix compatible either     major versions of ios are released annually  the current release  ios      was released on march          in ios  there are four abstraction layers  the core os layer  the core services layer  the media layer  and the cocoa touch layer  the current version of the operating system  ios       dedicates          gb of the device s flash memory for the system partition  using roughly     mb of that partition  varying by model  for ios itself      it runs on the iphone  s and later  ipad   and later  all models of the ipad mini  and the  th generation ipod touch             in       when steve jobs began planning the iphone  he had a choice to either  shrink the mac  which would be an epic feat of engineering  or enlarge the ipod   jobs favored the former approach but pitted the macintosh and ipod teams  led by scott forstall and tony fadell  respectively  against each other in an internal competition  with forstall winning by creating the iphone os  the decision enabled the success of the iphone as a platform for third party developers  using a well known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third party mac developers to write software for the iphone with minimal retraining    forstall was also responsible for creating a software developer s kit for programmers to build iphone apps  as well as an app store within itunes         the operating system was unveiled with the iphone at the macworld conference   expo  january          and released in june of that year    at first  apple marketing literature did not specify a separate name for the operating system  stating simply what steve jobs claimed   iphone runs os x  and runs  desktop applications      when in fact it runs a variant of mac os x  that doesn t run os x software unless it has been ported to the incompatible operating system  initially  third party applications were not supported  steve jobs  reasoning was that developers could build web applications that  would behave like native apps on the iphone       on october           apple announced that a native software development kit  sdk  was under development and that they planned to put it  in developers  hands in february     on march          apple released the first beta  along with a new name for the operating system   iphone os      apple had released the ipod touch  which had most of the non phone capabilities of the iphone  apple also sold more than one million iphones during the      holiday season    on january           apple announced the ipad  featuring a larger screen than the iphone and ipod touch  and designed for web browsing  media consumption  and reading ibooks       in june       apple rebranded iphone os as  ios   the trademark  ios  had been used by cisco for over a decade for its operating system  ios  used on its routers  to avoid any potential lawsuit  apple licensed the  ios  trademark from cisco       by late       ios accounted for     of the market share for smartphones and tablets    by the end of       ios accounted for     of the smartphone market   and       of the tablet market    as of feb       statcounter reported ios was used on        of smartphones and        of tablets worldwide       apple provides major updates to the ios operating system approximately once a year via itunes and also  for devices that came with ios version     or later  over the air  the latest version is ios    which is available for the iphone  s  iphone    iphone  c  iphone  s  iphone    iphone   plus  ipad    the third and fourth generation ipad  the first and second generation ipad air  the first  second and third generation ipad mini  and the fifth generation ipod touch  the os update was released on september              before the ios   release in       ipod touch users had to pay for system software updates  apple claimed that this was the case because the ipod touch was not a  subscription device  like the iphone  i e   it was a one off purchase     apple said it had  found a way  to deliver software updates for free to ipod touch users at wwdc      when ios   was unveiled       the home screen  rendered by and also known as  springboard   displays application icons and a dock at the bottom of the screen where users can pin their most frequently used apps  the home screen appears whenever the user unlocks the device or presses the  home  button  a physical button on the device  whilst in another app  the screen s background can be customized with other customizations available through jailbreaking  the screen has a status bar across the top to display data  such as time  battery level  and signal strength  the rest of the screen is devoted to the current application  when a passcode is set and a user switches on the device  the passcode must be entered at the lock screen before access to the home screen is granted     since ios version      a spotlight search function has been available on the leftmost page of the home screen page allowing users to search through media  music  videos  podcasts  etc    applications  e mails  contacts  messages  reminders  calendar events  and similar files  third party app files were not  and still are not  searchable using the spotlight feature  in ios    this feature can be accessed by pulling down anywhere on the home screen  except for the top and bottom edges that open notification center and control center          in ios     or later and with a supported device  the user can set a picture as the background of the home screen  this feature is only available on third generation devices or newer   iphone  gs or newer  ipod touch  rd gen  or newer  and all ipad models     researchers found that users organize icons on their homescreens based on usage frequency and relatedness of the applications  as well as for reasons of usability and aesthetics       with ios   came the introduction of a simple folder system  when applications are in  jiggle mode   any two  with the exception of newsstand in ios   and ios    which acts like a folder    can be dragged on top of each other to create a folder  and from then on  more apps can be added to the folder using the same procedure  up to    on iphone  s and earlier and ipod touch     on iphone    and    on ipad  a title for the folder is automatically selected by the category of applications inside  but the name can also be edited by the user  when apps inside folders receive badges  the numbers shown by the badges is added up and shown on the folder  folders cannot be put into other folders  though an unofficial workaround exists that enables folders to be nested within folders    ios   updated the folders with pages like on the springboard  each page can hold nine apps  and the newsstand app is now able to be placed into a folder     before ios    notifications were delivered in a blue dialog box  this system of notification management was greatly criticized  in the ios   update  the notifications feature was completely redesigned  notifications collate in a window which can be dragged down from the top of the screen    if a user touches a received notification  the application that sent the notification will be opened  notifications are now delivered in small banners that appear over the status bar  the old method of delivering notifications is still available from notification settings if the user wishes to enable it for some or all applications     when an app sends a notification whilst closed  a red badge will appear on its icon  this badge tells the user  at a glance  how many notifications that app has sent  opening the app clears the badge     the ios home screen contains these default  apps   some of these applications are hidden by default and accessed by the user through the settings app or another method for instance  nike ipod is activated through the settings app  many of these apps  such as safari  the app store  and siri  can also be disabled in the restrictions section of the settings app       each table s green area below shows the ios version for which each apple model app feature first became available     on the iphone and ipod touch  apps such as voice memos  contacts  calculator  and compass are in one folder called  utilities  in ios   and above      many of the included applications are designed to share data  e g   a phone number can be selected from an email and saved as a contact or dialed for a phone call   for the ios   update  the folder name was changed to  extras      the messages app supports apple s imessage service in ios   or above  imessage supports sending free text or multimedia messages to other ios devices running ios   and above  similar to blackberry messenger   and to macs running os x mavericks     panoramic photography is available only on iphone  s and later models  and the fifth generation ipod touch         the bottom row of applications  called the dock  is used to delineate the iphone s main purposes  originally phone  mail  safari  ipod  starting with ios    the ipod app was split into two apps  music and videos  as it always has been on the ipod touch  and the music app replaced the ipod app in the dock     since the inception of the iphone  various apps were either integrated into ios  e g  podcasts  ibooks  siri  facebook  twitter  or disintegrated  e g  podcasts  itunes u  youtube   in ios    the previously integrated youtube app was removed from the software  and moved to the app store  the podcasts and itunes u features  previously integrated in the music and videos apps  also became their own apps in the app store  in ios    the iphone gains a dedicated facetime app  previously integrated into the phone app   as it had been on the ipod touch and ipad since ios    in ios    the ibook and podcast apps became integrated into ios  though the app store app is still available for download     starting january       the ipod touch retains the same applications that are present by default on the iphone  with the exception of the phone and compass  and also previously  messages before ios   and camera before the fourth generation ipod touch  apps  the original dock layout was music  videos  photos  and itunes  in iphone os    the layout was changed to music  videos  safari  and app store  for the fourth generation ipod touch  it includes facetime and camera  and the dock layout had changed to music  mail  safari  videos  with the release of ios    with the release of the new fifth generation ipod touch and ios    the dock layout was changed to messages  mail  safari  music  similar to the iphone     the ipad and ipad mini come with the same applications as the ipod touch  excluding stocks  weather  calculator  and the nike   ipod app  and also previously  clock before ios     additionally  starting with the ipad    they have the unique photo booth app  most of the default applications  such as safari and mail  are completely rewritten to take advantage of the ipad s and ipad mini s larger displays  the original dock layout was safari  mail  photos  ipod  separate music and video apps are provided  as on the ipod touch  although  as on the iphone  the music app was named  ipod   in ios    it was changed to  music  and the dock layout became safari  mail  photos  music  in ios    videos replaced photos in the dock  in ios    the default dock layout was changed to match that of the ipod touch     multitasking for ios was first released in june      along with the release of ios          only certain devices iphone    iphone  gs  and ipod touch  rd generation were able to use multitasking    the ipad did not get multitasking until the release of ios       in november         currently  multitasking is supported on iphone  gs or newer  ipod touch  rd generation or newer  and all ipad models       implementation of multitasking in ios has been criticized for its approach  that limits the work that applications in the background can perform to a limited function set  and for requiring application developers to add explicit support for it         before ios    multitasking was limited to a selection of the applications apple included on the device  users could  however  jailbreak  their device in order to unofficially multitask    starting with ios    on third generation and newer ios devices  multitasking is supported through seven background apis       in ios    three new background apis were introduced     in ios    apple introduced a new multitasking feature  providing all apps with the ability to perform background updates  this feature prefers to update the user s most frequently used apps and prefers to use wifi networks over a cellular network  without markedly reducing the device s battery life     in ios     to ios   x  double clicking the home button activates the application switcher  a scrollable dock like interface appears from the bottom  moving the contents of the screen up  choosing an icon switches to an application  to the far left are icons which function as music controls  a rotation lock  and on ios     and above  a volume controller     with the introduction of ios    double clicking the home button also activates the application switcher  however  unlike previous versions it displays screenshots of open applications on top of the icon and horizontal scrolling allows for browsing through previous apps  and it is possible to close applications by dragging them up  similar to how webos handled multiple cards       briefly holding the icons in the application switcher makes them  jiggle   similarly to the homescreen  and allows the user to force quit the applications by tapping the red minus circle that appears at the corner of the app s icon    clearing applications from multitasking stayed the same from ios     through        the last version of ios       as of ios    the process has become faster and easier  in ios    instead of holding the icons to close them  they are closed by simply swiping them upwards off the screen  up to three apps can be cleared at a time compared to one in versions up to ios             task completion allows apps to continue a certain task after the app has been suspended      as of ios      apps can request up to ten minutes to complete a task in the background       siri is a personal assistant and knowledge navigator which works as an application on supported devices  the service  directed by the user s spoken commands  can do a variety of different tasks  such as call or text someone  open an app  search the web  lookup sports information  find directions or locations  and answer general knowledge questions  e g   how many cups are in a gallon       siri was updated in ios   with a new interface  faster answers  wikipedia  twitter  and bing support and the voice was changed to sound more human  siri is currently only available on the iphone  s and later iphones  the fifth generation ipod touch  all of the models of the ipad mini  and the third generation and later ipads     game center is an online multiplayer  social gaming network    released by apple    it allows users to  invite friends to play a game  start a multiplayer game through matchmaking  track their achievements  and compare their high scores on a leaderboard   ios   and above adds support for profile photos       game center was announced during an ios   preview event hosted by apple on april          a preview was released to registered apple developers in august    it was released on september         with ios     on iphone    iphone  gs  and ipod touch  nd generation through  th generation    game center made its public debut on the ipad with ios          there is no support for the iphone  g  original iphone and the first generation ipod touch  the latter two devices did not have game center because they did not get ios     however  game center is unofficially available on the iphone  g via a hack       the applications must be written and compiled  using xcode   or later and optimized for ios   or later    specifically for ios and the    bit arm architecture or previous    bit one  the safari web browser supports web applications as with other web browsers  authorized third party native applications are available for devices running ios     and later through apple s app store     on october           in an open letter posted to apple s  hot news  weblog  steve jobs announced that a software development kit  sdk  would be made available to third party developers in february         the sdk was released on march          and allows developers to make applications for the iphone and ipod touch  as well as test them in an  iphone simulator   however  loading an application onto the devices is only possible after paying an iphone developer program fee     the fees to join the respective developer programs for ios and os x were each set at us       per year  as of july           apple released xcode on its mac app store free to download for all os x lion users  instead of as a standalone download  users can create and develop ios and os x applications using a free copy of xcode  however  they cannot test their applications on a physical ios device  or publish them to the app store  without first paying the yearly        iphone developer or mac developer program fee       since the release of xcode      xcode is the development environment for the ios sdk  ios applications  like many of the higher level frameworks and applications that are part of ios and os x  are written in objective c       developers are able to set any price above a set minimum for their applications to be distributed through the app store  keeping     for the developer  and leaving     for apple  alternatively  they may opt to release the application for free and need not pay any costs to release or distribute the application except for the membership fee       since its initial release  ios has been subject to a variety of different hacks centered around adding functionality not allowed by apple citation needed prior to the      debut of apple s native ios app store  the primary motive for jailbreaking was to bypass apple s purchase mechanism for installing the app store s native applications    apple claimed that it will not release ios software updates designed specifically to break these tools  other than applications that perform sim unlocking   however  with each subsequent ios update  previously un patched jailbreak exploits are usually patched       since the arrival of apple s native ios app store  and along with it third party applications  the general motives for jailbreaking have changed    people jailbreak for many different reasons  including gaining filesystem access  installing custom device themes  and modifying the device springboard  on some devices  jailbreaking also makes it possible to install alternative operating systems  such as android and the linux kernel  primarily  users jailbreak their devices because of the limitations of ios  it should be noted that depending on the method used  the effects of jailbreaking may be permanent  or can be restored to the original state       in       the electronic frontier foundation  eff  successfully convinced the u s  copyright office to allow an exemption to the general prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems under the digital millennium copyright act  dmca   the exemption allows jailbreaking of iphones for the sole purpose of allowing legally obtained applications to be added to the iphone    the exemption does not affect the contractual relations between apple and an iphone owner  for example  jailbreaking voiding the iphone warranty  however  it is solely based on apple s discretion on whether they will fix jailbroken devices in the event that they need to be repaired  at the same time  the copyright office exempted unlocking an iphone from dmca s anticircumvention prohibitions    unlocking an iphone allows the iphone to be used with any wireless carrier using the same gsm or cdma technology for which the particular phone model was designed to operate       initially most wireless carriers in the us did not allow iphone owners to unlock an iphone for use with other carriers  at t mobility allows iphone owners who have satisfied the requirements of their contract to unlock their iphone    instructions to unlock the device are available from apple    but it is ultimately the sole discretion of the carrier to authorize the device to be unlocked    this allows the use of a carrier sourced iphone on other networks  however  because t mobile primarily uses a different band than at t for its  g data signals  the iphone will only work at  g speeds on the t mobile     xa mhz network    there are programs to break these restrictions  but are not supported by apple and most often not a permanent unlock  known as soft unlock       the closed and proprietary nature of ios has garnered criticism  particularly by digital rights advocates such as the electronic frontier foundation  computer engineer and activist brewster kahle  internet law specialist jonathan zittrain  and the free software foundation who protested the ipad s introductory event and have targeted the ipad with their  defective by design  campaign          competitor microsoft  via a pr spokesman  criticized apple s control over its platform       at issue are restrictions imposed by the design of ios  namely digital rights management  drm  intended to lock purchased media to apple s platform  the development model  requiring a yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the ios   the centralized approval process for apps  as well as apple s general control and lockdown of the platform itself  particularly at issue is the ability for apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will     some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked down ios represents a growing trend in apple s approach to computing  particularly apple s shift away from machines that hobbyists can  tinker with  and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation      former facebook developer joe hewitt protested against apple s control over its hardware as a  horrible precedent  but praised ios s sandboxing of apps       the ios kernel is xnu  the kernel of darwin  the original iphone os       up to iphone os       used darwin      d   ios   was based on darwin         ios   was based on darwin         ios   was
