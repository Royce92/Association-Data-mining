 in economics  marginal cost is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced has an increment by unit  that is  it is the cost of producing one more unit of a good   in general terms  marginal cost at each level of production includes any additional costs required to produce the next unit  for example  if producing additional vehicles requires building a new factory  the marginal cost of the extra vehicles includes the cost of the new factory  in practice  this analysis is segregated into short and long run cases  so that over the longest run  all costs become marginal  at each level of production and time period being considered  marginal costs include all costs that vary with the level of production  whereas other costs that do not vary with production are considered fixed     the graph is plotted with price  cost and revenue on the y axis and quantity on the x axis     if the good being produced is infinitely divisible  so the size of a marginal cost will change with volume  as a non linear and non proportional cost function includes the following     in practice the above definition of marginal cost as the change in total cost as a result of an increase in output of one unit is inconsistent with the differential definition of marginal cost for virtually all non linear functions  this is as the definition finds the tangent to the total cost curve at the point q which assumes that costs increase at the same rate as they were at q  a new definition may be useful for marginal unit cost  muc  using the current definition of the change in total cost as a result of an increase of one unit of output defined as  tc q    tc q  and re defining marginal cost to be the change in total as a result of an infinitesimally small increase in q which is consistent with its use in economic literature and can be calculated differentially     if the cost function is differentiable joining  the marginal cost is the cost of the next unit produced referring to the basic volume     if the cost function is not differentiable  the marginal cost can be expressed as follows     a number of other factors can affect marginal cost and its applicability to real world problems  some of these may be considered market failures  these may include information asymmetries  the presence of negative or positive externalities  transaction costs  price discrimination and others             in the simplest case  the total cost function and its derivative are expressed as follows  where q represents the production quantity  vc represents variable costs  fc represents fixed costs and tc represents total costs     nsince  by definition  fixed costs do not vary with production quantity  it drops out of the equation when it is differentiated  the important conclusion is that marginal cost is not related to fixed costs  this can be compared with average total cost or atc  which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced and does include fixed costs     for discrete calculation without calculus  marginal cost equals the change in total  or variable  cost that comes with each additional unit produced  in contrast  incremental cost is the composition of total cost from the surrogate of contributions  where any increment is determined by the contribution of the cost factors  not necessarily by single units     for instance  suppose the total cost of making   shoe is     and the total cost of making   shoes is      the marginal cost of producing the second shoe is                     marginal cost is not the cost of producing the  next  or  last  unit   as silberberg and suen note  the cost of the last unit is the same as the cost of the first unit and every other unit  in the short run  increasing production requires using more of the variable input   conventionally assumed to be labor  adding more labor to a fixed capital stock reduces of the diminishing marginal returns  this reduction in productivity is not limited to the additional labor needed to produce the marginal unit   the productivity of every unit of labor is reduced  thus the costs of producing the marginal unit of output has two components  the cost associated with producing the marginal unit and the increase in average costs for all units produced due to the  damage  to the entire productive process   ac  q q  the first component is the per unit or average cost  the second unit is the small increase in costs due to the law of diminishing marginal returns which increases the costs of all units of sold     marginal costs can also be expressed as the cost per unit of labor divided by the marginal product of labour      because  is the change in quantity of labor that affects a one unit change in output  this implies that this equals   therefore    since the wage rate is assumed constant  marginal cost and marginal product of labor have an inverse relationship if marginal cost is increasing  decreasing  the marginal product of labor is decreasing  increasing       economies of scale is a concept that applies to the long run  a span of time in which all inputs can be varied by the firm so that there are no fixed inputs or fixed costs  production may be subject to economies of scale  or diseconomies of scale   economies of scale are said to exist if an additional unit of output can be produced for less than the average of all previous units  that is  if long run marginal cost is below long run average cost  so the latter is falling  conversely  there may be levels of production where marginal cost is higher than average cost  and average cost is an increasing function of output  for this generic case  minimum average cost occurs at the point where average cost and marginal cost are equal  when plotted  the marginal cost curve intersects the average cost curve from below   this point will not be at the minimum for marginal cost if fixed costs are greater than       the portion of the marginal cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market   the portion of the mc curve below its intersection with the avc curve is not part of the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shut down point  this is not true for firms operating in other market structures  for example  while a monopoly  has  an mc curve it does not have a supply curve  in a perfectly competitive market  a supply curve shows the quantity a seller s willing and able to supply at each price   for each price there is a unique quantity that would be supplied  the one to one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly  with a monopoly there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity  it all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve     in perfectly competitive markets  firms decide the quantity to be produced based on marginal costs and sale price  if the sale price is higher than the marginal cost  then they supply the unit and sell it  if the marginal cost is higher than the price  it would not be profitable to produce it  so the production will be carried out until the marginal cost is equal to the sale price  in other words  firms refuse to sell if the marginal cost is higher than the market price      marginal costs are not affected by changes in fixed cost  marginal costs can be expressed as  c q   q  since fixed costs do not vary with  depend on  changes in quantity  mc is  vc  q  thus if fixed cost were to double mc would not be affected and consequently the profit maximizing quantity and price would not change  this can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short run variable cost curve  the shape of the curves are identical  each curve initially decreases at a decreasing rate  reaches an inflection point  then increases at an increasing rate  the only difference between the curves is that the srvc curve begins from the origin while the srtc curve originates on the y axis  the distance of the origin of the srtc above the origin represents the fixed cost   the vertical distance between the curves  this distance remains constant as the quantity produced  q  increases  mc is the slope of the srvc curve  a change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the srtc and srvc curve  any such change would have no effect on the shape of the srvc curve and therefore its slope at any point   mc     externalities are costs  or benefits  that are not borne by the parties to the economic transaction  a producer may  for example  pollute the environment  and others may bear those costs  a consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society  such as education  because the individual does not receive all of the benefits  he may consume less than efficiency would suggest  alternatively  an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others  in these cases  production or consumption of the good in question may differ from the optimum level     much of the time  private and social costs do not diverge from one another  but at times social costs may be either greater or less than private costs  when marginal social costs of production are greater than that of the private cost function  we see the occurrence of a negative externality of production  productive processes that result in pollution are a textbook example of production that creates negative externalities     such externalities are a result of firms externalising their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost  as a result of externalising such costs we see that members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm  in this case  we see that an increased cost of production on society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve     in an equilibrium state we see that markets creating negative externalities of production will overproduce that good  as a result  the socially optimal production level would be lower than that observed     when marginal social costs of production are less than that of the private cost function  we see the occurrence of a positive externality of production  production of public goods are a textbook example of production that create positive externalities  an example of such a public good  which creates a divergence in social and private costs  includes the production of education  it is often seen that education is a positive for any whole society  as well as a positive for those directly involved in the market     examining the relevant diagram we see that such production creates a social cost curve that is less than that of the private curve  in an equilibrium state we see that markets creating positive externalities of production will under produce that good  as a result  the socially optimal production level would be greater than that observed     of great importance in the theory of marginal cost is the distinction between the marginal private and social costs  the marginal private cost shows the cost associated to the firm in question  it is the marginal private cost that is used by business decision makers in their profit maximization goals  marginal social cost is similar to private cost in that it includes the cost of private enterprise but also any other cost  or offsetting benefit  to society to parties having no direct association with purchase or sale of the product  it incorporates all negative and positive externalities  of both production and consumption  examples might include a social cost from air pollution affecting third parties or a social benefit from flu shots protecting others from infection
