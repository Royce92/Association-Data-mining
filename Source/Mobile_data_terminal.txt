 a mobile data terminal  mdt  or mobile digital computer  mdc  is a computerized device used in public transit vehicles  taxicabs  courier vehicles  service trucks  commercial trucking fleets  military logistics  fishing fleets  warehouse inventory control  and emergency vehicles  such as police cars  to communicate with a central dispatch office  they are also used to display mapping and information relevant to the tasks and actions performed by the vehicle such as cad drawings  diagrams   safety information     mobile data terminals feature a screen on which to view information and a keyboard or keypad for entering information  and may be connected to various peripheral devices  standard peripherals include two way radios and taximeters  both of which predate computer assisted dispatching  mdts may be simple display and keypad units  intended to be connected to a separate black box or avl  see below  computer  while mdts were originally dumb terminals most have been replaced with fully functional pc hardware  known as mdcs  mobile digital computers   while the mdc term is more correct  mdt is still widely used  other common terms include mvc  motor vehicle computer  and names of manufacturers such as imobile or kdt             in the earlier days of computer aided dispatching  cad   many mdt s were custom devices  used with specialized point to point radios  particularly in applications such as police dispatching  while applications like taxi and package delivery often still use custom designed terminals  majority of cad systems have switched to rugged ruggedized  laptops and wide area wireless ip communications  utilizing the internet or private ip networks connected to and over it  tough environmental conditions almost require rugged laptops which have received a mil    g rating citation needed panasonic is the industry leader in rugged laptops with large market share in police  fire  ems and utility vehicles citation needed    for many industrial applications  such as commercial trucking  gis  agriculture  mobile asset management  and other industries  custom electronic hardware is still preferred  custom terminals use i o interfaces that connect directly to industry specific equipment  they are usually environmentally hardened packages with power supply protection and robust memory file systems that greatly improve reliability and task efficiency  mdt solutions that are based on ruggedized consumer products or consumer available software will typically not have the life cycle duration expected in industrial applications  over   years     a related device classification  specific to the transportation industry  is called automatic vehicle location  avl   mobile data terminals are often used in conjunction with a  black box  that contains gps receiver  cell phone transceiver  other radio devices  or interfaces to industry specific equipment  avl devices may be simple stand alone modems or may include operating systems with application space for the system integrator     mdts are most commonly associated with in vehicle use  this requires the mdt to be anchored to the vehicle for driver safety  device security  and user ergonomics     mounts are designed for attaching mdts to mobile workspaces into most notably automobiles  forklifts  boats  and planes  specialized manufacturers such as gamber johnson and havis  formally ledco  build mounts for the specific mdt brands and models and for specific vehicles  specialized regional metal shops and mount design integrators design mdt mounting hardware for low volume specialized applications such as forklifts and commercial boats     mdts generally require specific installation protocols to be followed for proper ergonomics  power and communications functionality  mdt installation companies such as pcn strategies  usat corp  and touchstar pacific specialize in designing the mount design  assembling the proper parts  and installing them in a safe and consistent manner away from airbags  vehicle hvac controls  and driver controls  frequently installations will include a wan modem  power conditioning equipment  and a wan  wlan  and gps antenna mounted external to the vehicle
