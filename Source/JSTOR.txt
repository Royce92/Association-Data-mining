be a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries  especially research and university libraries  due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence  most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals  by digitizing many journal titles  jstor allowed libraries to outsource the storage of these journals with the confidence that they would remain available for the long term  online access and full text search ability improved access dramatically     jstor was initiated in      at seven

according to harvard law professor lawrence lessig  jstor had been asked  how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world  how much would we need to pay you  the answer was      million        in late      and early       internet activist aaron swartz used mit s data network to bulk download a substantial portion of jstor s collection of academic journal articles      when discovered  jstor stopped the download  and identified swartz  rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him  in june      it reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data         the following month  federal authorities charged swartz with several  data theft  related crimes  including wire fraud  computer fraud  unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer  and recklessly damaging a protected computer      prosecutors in the case claimed that swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on p p file sharing sites         swartz surrendered to authorities  pleaded not guilty to all counts  and was released on          bail  in september       u s  attorneys increased the number of charges against swartz from four to thirteen  with a possible penalty of    years in prison and    million in fines      the case still was pending when swartz committed suicide in january            the availability of most journals on jstor is controlled by a  moving wall   which is an agreed upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on jstor  this time period is specified by agreement between jstor and the publisher of the journal  which usually is three to five years  publishers may request that the period of a  moving wall  be changed or request discontinuation of coverage  formerly publishers also could request that the  moving wall  be changed to a  fixed wall  a specified date after which jstor would not add new volumes to its database  as of november     update   fixed wall  agreements were still in effect with three publishers of    journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers       in       jstor started adding current issues of certain journals through its current scholarship program       beginning september          jstor made public domain content freely available to the public      this  early journal content  program

      jstor stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time  the swartz controversy and greg maxwell s protest torrent of some of the same content led jstor to  press ahead  with the initiative         in january       jstor started a pilot program   register   read   offering limited no cost access  not open access  to archived articles for individuals who register for
