 business continuity encompasses a loosely defined set of planning  preparatory and related activities which are intended to ensure that an organization s critical business functions will either continue to operate despite serious incidents or disasters that might otherwise have interrupted them  or will be recovered to an operational state within a reasonably short period  as such  business continuity includes three key elements     resilience  critical business functions and the supporting infrastructure are designed and engineered in such a way that they are materially unaffected by most disruptions  for example through the use of redundancy and spare capacity     recovery  arrangements are made to recover or restore critical and less critical business functions that fail for some reason     contingency  the organization establishes a generalized capability and readiness to cope effectively with whatever major incidents and disasters occur  including those that were not  and perhaps could not have been  foreseen  contingency preparations constitute a last resort response if resilience and recovery arrangements should prove inadequate in practice     if there is no business continuity plan implemented and the organization in question is facing a rather severe threat or disruption that may lead to bankruptcy  the implementation and outcome  if not too late  may strengthen the organization s survival and its continuity of business activities  gittleman            the management of business continuity falls largely within the sphere of risk management  with some cross over into related fields such as governance  information security and compliance  risk is a core consideration since business continuity is primarily concerned with those business functions  operations  supplies  systems  relationships etc  that are critically important to achieve the organization s operational objectives  business impact analysis is the generally accepted risk management term for the process of determining the relative importance or criticality of those elements  and in turn drives the priorities  planning  preparations and other business continuity management activities     the foundation of business continuity are the standards  program development  and supporting policies  guidelines  and procedures needed to ensure a firm to continue without stoppage  irrespective of the adverse circumstances or events  all system design  implementation  support  and maintenance must be based on this foundation in order to have any hope of achieving business continuity  disaster recovery  or in some cases  system support             several business continuity standards have been published by various standards bodies     iso   iso

north america   published by the national fire protection association nfpa       standard on disaster emergency management and business continuity programs     north america   asis bsi bcm

business continuity management in       standards australia introduced their standard as nzs      that connects far more closely with traditional risk management practices  this interpretation is designed to be used in conjunction with as nzs       covering risk management     ongoing management level process to ensure that necessary steps are regularly taken to identify probable accidents  disasters  emergencies  and or threats  it also involves     assessment of the probable effect of such events      development of recovery strategies and plans  and     maintenance of their readiness through personnel training and plan testing  see also business impact analysis    policies are those things mandated by the management of an organization that will always be performed according to a preset design plan  and supporting all business functions within an organization     the components of the business continuity methodology required for manifestation into a documented plan include     set of documents  instructions  and procedures which enable a business to respond to accidents  disasters  emergencies  and or threats without any stoppage or hindrance in its key operations  also called business resumption plan  disaster recovery plan  or recovery plan     should also include  purpose  scope  objectives and assumptions that were used to develop the plan  key accountabilities including authority to invoke  instructions subsequent to invocations  and a detailed communications plan must be included in the plan to ensure efficient resumption of operations     task of identifying  developing  acquiring  documenting  and testing procedures and resources that will ensure continuity of a firm s key operations in the event of an accident  disaster  emergency  and or threat  it involves     risk mitigation planning  reducing possibility of the occurrence of adverse events   and     business recovery planning  ensuring continued operation in the aftermath of a disaster      guidelines are those things which are recommended to be performed according to a preset design plan  however depending upon the needs and requirements of the target business function  these items may or may not be performed  or may be altered during implementation     british standard         and other standards identified above provide a specification for implementing a business continuity management system within an organization     the entire concept of business continuity is based on the identification of all business functions within an organization  and then assigning a level of importance to each business function  a business impact analysis is the primary tool for gathering this information and assigning criticality  recovery point objectives  and recovery time objectives  and is therefore part of the basic foundation of business continuity     the bia can be used to identify extent and timescale of the impact on different levels of an organization  for instance it can examine the effect of disruption on operational  functional and strategic activities of an organization  not only the current activities but the effect of disruption on major business changes  introducing new product or services for example  can be determined by bia     most standards require that a business impact analysis should be reviewed at defined intervals appropriate for each organization and whenever any of the following occur     in today s global business environment  security must be the top priority in managing information technology  for most organizations  security is mandated by law  and conformance to those mandates is investigated regularly in the form of audits  failure to pass security audits can have financial and management changing impacts upon an organization     in large information technology environments  personnel turnover is inevitable and must be planned as part of business continuity  the solution to the problems associated with turnover  is complete and up to  date documentation  this insures that new personnel will have the information they need to quickly become knowledgeable and productive with respect to the business functions they are tasked to support  this also implies that business function related documentation is largely generated  rather than written  from existing systems and managed in an automated manner     regulations require that changes to business functions be documented and tracked for auditing purposes and is designated as  change control   this brings a level of stability to the business functions by requiring the support personnel to document and coordinate proposed changes to the underlying systems  as this process becomes more and more automated  the emphasis will be less upon personnel control  and more upon regulatory compliance     one of the most costly and time consuming aspects of information technology management is dealing with auditors  one of the goals of business continuity is data center automation  which includes audit management  all modern business functions should be designed with the concept of automatically generating the requisite audit compliance information and documentation as part of conducting day to day business  this dramatically reduces the time and cost associated with manually producing this information     automation is often associated with the idea of centralized management   in area of data storage and data management  solutions based on storage consolidation can ensure data safety  efficiency  high availability  reliability and convenience      the interface between management and information technology is the service level agreement  sla   this provides a written contract stipulating the expectations of management with regard to the availability of a necessary business function  and the deliverables that information technology provides in support of that business function     another component of business continuity is communications in times of duress  members of the disaster recovery team must be able to communicate effectively among themselves as well as with managers  directors  customers  partners  and even with the media   in order to avoid some of the potential problems associated with disrupted communication channels  the business continuity plan should include a lead manager who will be in charge of all communications in that area  the cooperation of executives and public relations people  and scheduled exercises to put the plan into practice     disaster recovery planning occurs as a subset of defining the business continuity procedures     the following is a list of physical and logical entities within an information technology environment which require the application of a business continuity methodology  applying the methodology should include the definition of things such as policies  guidelines  standards  procedures  etc   for each item in the list     planning  prevention  and preparation are a key part of any business continuity management system and have direct read across from civil contingencies planning  the activity begins with understanding the business to identify potential risks and threats to critical business activities both internally and from the external environment  it is also advisable to examine the resilience of suppliers
