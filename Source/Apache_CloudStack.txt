 cloudstack is open source cloud computing software for creating  managing  and deploying infrastructure cloud services  it uses existing hypervisors such as kvm  vsphere  and xenserver xcp for virtualization  in addition to its own api  cloudstack also supports the amazon web services  aws  api  and the open cloud computing interface from the open grid forum              cloudstack was originally developed by cloud com  formerly known as vmops   in may       cloud com released most of cloudstack as free software under the gnu general public license  version    gplv    they kept about    proprietary   cloud com and citrix both supported openstack  another apache licensed cloud computing program  at its announcement in july           citrix purchased cloud com on july           for approximately      million    in august       citrix released the remaining code under gplv  and continued moving towards more open processes   in february       citrix released cloudstack      among other features  this added support for swift  openstack s s  like object storage solution   in april       citrix donated cloudstack to the apache software foundation  asf   where it was accepted into the apache incubator  citrix changed the license to the apache license version    as part of this change  citrix also ceased their involvement in openstack    on november          cloudstack       incubating was announced    the first stable release after joining asf  on march           cloudstack graduated from apache incubator and became a top level project  tlp  of asf    the first stable  maintenance  release after graduation is cloudstack             the minimum production installation consists of one machine running the cloudstack management server and another machine to act as the cloud infrastructure  in this case  a very simple infrastructure consisting of one host running hypervisor software   in its smallest deployment  a single machine can act as both the management server and the hypervisor host  using the kvm hypervisor        multiple management servers can be configured for redundancy and load balancing  all pointing to a common mysql database     in july      it was reported that datapipe launched the largest international public cloud to be built on cloudstack  which included   data centers in the usa  britain  and asia       among the notable users
