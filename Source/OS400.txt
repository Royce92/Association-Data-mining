 ibm i is an ebcdic based operating system that runs on ibm power systems and on ibm puresystems  the name was introduced in       and it is the current evolution of the operating system  previously named i  os  and originally named os     when it was introduced with the as     computer system in          it is one of the operating systems supported on ibm power systems alongside aix and linux as well as on ibm puresystems alongside aix  linux and windows             the early ibm system    and ibm system    series customers were a key target of the as      so os      and its descendants i  os and ibm i   have built in subsystems that provide backward compatibility with these earlier ibm general business systems  ibm i programs  like system    programs before them  contain both processor independent  virtual  binary code and processor dependent executable binary code  compilers for ibm i produce the processor independent code as their output  the operating system automatically translates the processor independent code into the processor dependent code as needed  without the need for source code or attention by it personnel  notably  when migrating from a legacy processor  the only effect that most organizations notice is that the program runs somewhat longer when it runs for the first time on the new computer  migration consists of taking a backup from the old computer  and restoring it on the new      ibm designed ibm i as a  turnkey  operating system  requiring little or no on site attention from it staff during normal operation  for example  ibm i has a built in db  database which does not require separate installation  disks are multiply redundant  and can be replaced on line without interrupting work  hardware and software maintenance tasks are integrated  system administration has been wizard driven for years  even before that term was defined  this automatic self care policy goes so far as to automatically schedule all common system maintenance  detect many failures and even order spare parts and service automatically  organizations using i sometimes have sticker shock when confronting the cost of system maintenance on other systems      another peculiar feature is that this system was one of the earliest to be object based  unlike traditional oses like unix and windows nt there are no files  only objects of different types  it implemented one of the earliest known systems for persistent objects  further  the objects persist in very large  flat virtual memory  called a single level store      the ibm i access licensed product includes iseries navigator  a client based and web based graphical tool for administration of the system  database  apache web server  and websphere application server  ibm systems director navigator for i now can be used to manage target servers running ibm i          or     from a single browser environment with the ibm i         in       ibm introduced logical partitioning  lpars  with i  os to support multiple virtual systems on a single hardware footprint     in       ibm and mysql ab announced a joint technology and reseller agreement to bring support for the mysql open source database and db  for i as a certified mysql storage engine to the ibm i platform  which was later in      dropped by mysql ab     in       ibm and zend technologies announced zend dbi as replacement for the mysql on ibm i support with a first general availability release in          in       ibm and powerruby inc  announced powerruby as a commercially supported port of the ruby programming language and the ruby on rails web application framework for ibm i  powerruby will be offered as a free download to be installed on customer machines     in       ibm ported node js to ibm i      when ibm announced the new power systems line of servers on april          they renamed the operating system from i  os to ibm i  and changed the version identifier format from vxrxmx  version  release  modification  e g  v r m   to the more standard format  e g           the latest version of ibm i is      announced on april          and released on may          version support schedule      with      ibm started delivering new updates to the operating system via technology refreshes  where number   was released in november          user groups have played a major part in the evolution of the ibm i  the largest such group is common   the young i professionals  yips    is another group that has been significant in influencing the direction of the ibm i
