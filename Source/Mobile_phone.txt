 a mobile phone  also known as a cellular phone  cell phone  hand phone  or simply a phone  is a phone that can make and receive telephone calls over a radio link while moving around a wide geographic area  it does so by connecting to a cellular network provided by a mobile phone operator  allowing access to the public telephone network  by contrast  a cordless telephone is used only within the short range of a single  private base station     in addition to telephony  modern mobile phones also support a wide variety of other services such as text messaging  mms  email  internet access  short range wireless communications  infrared  bluetooth   business applications  gaming  and photography  mobile phones that offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones     the first hand held cell phone was demonstrated by john f  mitchell   and dr  martin cooper of motorola in       using a handset weighing around     pounds   xa kg    in       the dynatac     x was the first to be commercially available  from      to       worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew from zero to over   billion  penetrating      of the global population and reaching the bottom of the economic pyramid   in       the top cell phone manufacturers were samsung  nokia  apple  and lg              na hand held mobile radiotelephone is an old dream of radio engineering  one of the earliest descriptions can be found in the      science fiction novel space cadet by robert heinlein  the protagonist  who has just traveled to colorado from his home in iowa  receives a call from his father on a telephone in his pocket  before leaving for earth orbit  he decides to ship the telephone home  since it was limited by its short range to the neighborhood of an earth side i e  terrestrial relay office   ten years later  an essay by arthur c  clarke envisioned a  personal transceiver  so small and compact that every man carries one   clarke wrote   the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on earth merely by dialing a number   such a device would also  in clarke s vision  include means for global positioning so that  no one need ever again be lost   later  in profiles of the future  he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid     s      early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio communications from ships and trains  the race to create truly portable telephone devices began after world war ii  with developments taking place in many countries  the advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive generations from the early   g   zeroth generation  services like the bell system s mobile telephone service and its successor  improved mobile telephone service  these   g  systems were not cellular  supported few simultaneous calls  and were very expensive     the first handheld mobile cell phone was demonstrated by motorola in       the first commercial automated cellular network was launched in japan by ntt in       in       this was followed by the simultaneous launch of the nordic mobile telephone  nmt  system in denmark  finland  norway and sweden   several other countries then followed in the early to mid     s  these first generatiion    g   systems could support far more simultaneous calls  but still used analog technology     in       the second generation   g  digital cellular technology was launched in finland by radiolinja on the gsm standard  which sparked competition in the sector  as the new operators challenged the incumbent  g network operators     ten years later  in       the third generation   g  was launched in japan by ntt docomo on the wcdma standard   this was followed by    g   g  or turbo  g enhancements based on the high speed packet access  hspa  family  allowing umts networks to have higher data transfer speeds and capacity     by       it had become clear that  at some point   g networks would be overwhelmed by the growth of bandwidth intensive applications like streaming media   consequently  the industry began looking to data optimized  th generation technologies  with the promise of speed improvements up to    fold over existing  g technologies  the first two commercially available technologies billed as  g were the wimax standard  offered in the u s  by sprint  and the lte standard  first offered in scandinavia by teliasonera     all mobile phones have a number of features in common  but manufacturers also try to differentiate their own products by implementing additional functions to make them more attractive to consumers  this has led to great innovation in mobile phone development over the past    years     the common components found on all phones are     low end mobile phones are often referred to as feature phones  and offer basic telephony  handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native software applications became known as smartphones     in sound quality however  smartphones and feature phones vary little  some audio quality enhancing features like voice over lte  hd voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones  sound quality can remain a problem with both  as this depends  not so much on the phone itself  as on the quality of the network  and in case of long distance calls  the bottlenecks choke points met along the way    as such  on long distance calls even features such as voice over lte  hd voice may not improve things  in some cases smartphones can improve audio quality even on long distance calls  by using voip phone service  with someone else s wifi internet connection        several phone series have been introduced to address specific market segments  such as the rim blackberry focusing on enterprise corporate customer email needs  the sony ericsson  walkman  series of music phones and  cybershot  series of camera phones  the nokia nseries of multimedia phones  the palm pre the htc dream and the apple iphone     the most commonly used data application on mobile phones is sms text messaging  the first sms text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in      in the uk  while the first person to person sms from phone to phone was sent in finland in          the first mobile news service  delivered via sms  was launched in finland in       and subsequently many organizations provided  on demand  and  instant  news services by sms     gsm feature phones require a small microchip called a subscriber identity module or sim card  to function  the sim card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit  the sim securely stores the service subscriber key  imsi  and the ki used to identify and authenticate the user of the mobile phone  the sim card allows users to change phones by simply removing the sim card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device  provided that this is not prevented by a sim lock     the first sim card was made in      by munich smart card maker giesecke   devrient for the finnish wireless network operator radiolinja citation needed    a hybrid mobile phone can hold up to four sim cards  sim and ruim cards may be mixed together to allow both gsm and cdma networks to be accessed         from      onwards they became popular in india and indonesia and other emerging markets    attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on net calling rate  in q        nokia shipped    million of its low cost dual sim phone range in an attempt to make up lost ground in the higher end smartphone market       there are jewish orthodox religious restrictions which  by some interpretations  standard mobile telephones do not meet  to solve this issue  some rabbinical organizations have recommended that phones with text messaging capability not be used by children    these restricted phones are known as kosher phones and have rabbinical approval for use in israel and elsewhere by observant orthodox jews  although these phones are intended to prevent immodesty  some vendors report good sales to adults who prefer the simplicity of the devices  some phones are even approved for use by essential workers  such as health  security and public services  on the sabbath  even though use of any electrical device is generally prohibited       the world s largest individual mobile operator by subscribers is china mobile with over     million mobile phone subscribers    over    mobile operators have over    million subscribers each  and over     mobile operators had at least one million subscribers by the end of         in       there were more than seven billion mobile phone subscribers worldwide  a number that is expected to keep growing     prior to       nokia was the market leader  however  since then competition emerged in the asia pacific region with brands such as micromax  nexian  and i mobile and chipped away at nokia s market share  android powered smartphones also gained momentum across the region at the expense of nokia  in india  their market share also dropped significantly to around    percent from    percent in the same period  their share was displaced by chinese and indian vendors of low end mobile phones       in q        based on strategy analytics  samsung surpassed nokia  selling      million units and      million units  respectively  standard   poor s has also downgraded nokia to  junk  status at bb  b with negative outlook due to high loss and still declined with growth of lumia smartphones was not sufficient to offset a rapid decline in revenue from symbian based smartphones over the next few quarters       in q        the top    manufacturers were samsung          nokia         apple inc          lg         huawei         tcl communication        xiaomi         lenovo         zte        and micromax              other

members  conducting business  and having access to a telephone in the event of an emergency  some people carry more than one cell phone for different purposes  such as for business and personal use  multiple sim cards may also be used to take advantage of the benefits of different calling plans a particular plan might provide cheaper local calls  long distance calls  international calls  or roaming  the mobile phone has also been used in a variety of diverse contexts in society  for example     smartphones have a number of distinguishing features but the itu measures those with internet connection which it calls active mobile broadband subscriptions  which includes tablets etc   in the developed world these have now overtaken the usage of earlier mobile systems but in the developing world account for only         in       one of the first examples of distributing and selling media content through the mobile phone was the sale of ringtones by radiolinja in finland  soon afterwards  other media content appeared such as news  video games  jokes  horoscopes  tv content and advertising  most early content for mobile tended to be copies of legacy media  such as the banner advertisement or the tv news highlight video clip  recently  unique content for mobile has been emerging  from the ringing tones and ringback tones in music to  mobisodes   video content that has been produced exclusively for mobile phones     in       the total value of mobile phone paid media content exceeded internet paid media content and was worth    billion dollars    the value of music on phones was worth     billion dollars in      and gaming was worth over   billion dollars in            mobile phone use while driving is common but controversial  being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents  because of this  many jurisdictions prohibit the use of mobile phones while driving  egypt  israel  japan  portugal and singapore ban both handheld and hands free use of a mobile phone  others  including the uk  france  and many u s  states ban handheld phone use only  allowing hands free use     due to the increasing complexity of mobile phones  they are often more like mobile computers in their available uses  this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials in distinguishing one usage from another as drivers use their devices  this is more apparent in those countries which ban both handheld and hands free usage  rather than those who have banned handheld use only  as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver  this can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally on a phone call when  in fact  they were using the device for a legal purpose such as the phone s incorporated controls for car stereo or satnav     a recently published study has reviewed the incidence of mobile phone use while cycling and its effects on behaviour and safety       in many countries  mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services  which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure sms text message  kenya s m pesa mobile banking service  for example  allows customers of the mobile phone operator safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their sim cards  cash may be deposited or withdrawn from m pesa accounts at safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country  and may be transferred electronically from person to person as well as used to pay bills to companies     branchless banking has also been successful in south africa and the philippines  a pilot project in bali was launched in      by the international finance corporation and an indonesian bank bank mandiri       another application of mobile banking technology is zidisha  a us based nonprofit micro lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from web users worldwide  zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments  transferring funds from lenders in the united states to the borrowers in rural africa using the internet and mobile phones       mobile payments were first trialled in finland in      when two coca cola vending machines in espoo were enabled to work with sms payments  eventually  the idea spread and in      the philippines launched the country s first commercial mobile payments systems on the mobile operators globe and smart     some mobile phone can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes or through contactless payments if the phone and point of sale support near field communication  nfc     this requires the co operation of manufacturers  network operators and retail merchants to enable contactless payments through nfc equipped mobile phones           mobile phones are also commonly used to collect location data  while the phone is turned on  the geographical location of a mobile phone can be determined easily  whether it is being used or not   using a technique known as multilateration to calculate the differences in time for a signal to travel from the cell phone to each of several cell towers near the owner of the phone         the movements of a mobile phone user can be tracked by their service provider and  if desired  by law enforcement agencies and their government  both the sim card and the handset can be tracked       china has proposed using this technology to track commuting patterns of beijing city residents    in the uk and us  law enforcement and intelligence services use mobiles to perform surveillance  they possess technology to activate the microphones in cell phones remotely in order to listen to conversations that take place near the phone         according to the federal communications commission  one out of three robberies involved the theft of a cellular phone  police data in san francisco showed that one half of all robberies in      were thefts of cellular phones  an online petition on change org called secure our smartphones urged smartphone manufacturers to install kill switches in their devices to make them unusable in case of theft  the petition is part of a joint effort by new york attorney general eric schneiderman and san francisco district attorney george gasc n and was directed to the ceos of the major smartphone manufacturers and telecommunication carriers       on monday     june       apple announced it would install a kill switch on its next iphone operating system  due to debut in october            the effect mobile phone radiation has on human health is the subject of recent interest and study  as a result of the enormous increase in mobile phone usage throughout the world  mobile phones use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range  which some believe may be harmful to human health  a large body of research exists  both epidemiological and experimental  in non human animals and in humans  of which the majority shows no definite causative relationship between exposure to mobile phones and harmful biological effects in humans  this is often paraphrased simply as the balance of evidence showing no harm to humans from mobile phones  although a significant number of individual studies do suggest such a relationship  or are inconclusive  other digital wireless systems  such as data communication networks  produce similar radiation     on    may       the world health organization stated that mobile phone use may possibly represent a long term health risk      classifying mobile phone radiation as  possibly carcinogenic to humans  after a team of scientists reviewed studies on cell phone safety    mobile phones are in category  b  which ranks it alongside coffee and other possibly carcinogenic substances         at least some recent studies have found an association between cell phone use and certain kinds of brain and salivary gland tumors  lennart hardell and other authors of a      meta analysis of    studies from peer reviewed journals concluded that cell phone usage for at least ten years  approximately doubles the risk of being diagnosed with a brain tumor on the same   ipsilateral   side of the head as that preferred for cell phone use        one study of past cell phone use cited in the report showed a      increased risk for gliomas  brain cancer  in the highest category of heavy users  reported average     minutes per day over a    year period      this is a reversal from their prior position that cancer was unlikely to be caused by cellular phones or their base stations and that reviews had found no convincing evidence for other health effects      certain countries  including france  have warned against the use of cell phones especially by minors due to health risk uncertainties    however  a study published    march      in the british medical journal questioned these estimates  because the increase in brain cancers has not paralleled the increase in mobile phone use        g is a technology used in research papers and projects to denote the next major phase of mobile telecommunication standards beyond the  g imt advanced standards   g is not officially used for any specification or official document yet made public by telecommunication companies or standardization bodies such as  gpp  wimax forum  or itu r  new standard releases beyond  g are in progress by standardization bodies  but are at this time not considered as new mobile generations but under the  g umbrella     deloitte is predicting a collapse in wireless performance to come as soon as       as more devices using more and more services compete for limited bandwidth       studies have shown that around        of the environmental impact of a mobile phone occurs during the manufacturing of the printed wiring boards and integrated circuits    the average user replaces their mobile phone every    to    months    the discarded phones then contribute to electronic waste     mobile phone manufacturers within europe are subject to the weee directive  australia introduced a mobile phone recycling scheme       demand for metals found in mobile phones and other electroncs fuelled the second congo war  the war claimed almost     million lives    in a      news story  the guardian reported   in unsafe mines deep underground in eastern congo  children are working to extract minerals essential for the electronics industry  the profits from the minerals finance the bloodiest conflict since the second world war  the war has lasted nearly    years and has recently flared up again      for the last    years  the democratic republic of the congo has been a major source of natural resources for the mobile phone industry        fairphone is an attempt to develop a mobile phone which does not contain conflict minerals
