 twitter is an online social networking service that enables users to send and read short     character messages called  tweets      registered users can read and post tweets  but unregistered users can only read them  users access twitter through the website interface  sms  or mobile device app    twitter inc  is based in san francisco and has more than    offices around the world       twitter was created in march      by jack dorsey  evan williams  biz stone and noah glass and launched by july       the service rapidly gained worldwide popularity  with more than     million users who in      posted     million tweets per day    the service also handled     billion search queries per day        in      twitter was one of the ten most visited websites  and has been described as  the sms of the internet      as of december       twitter has more than     million users  out of which more than     million are active users              twitter s origins lie in a  daylong brainstorming session  held by board members of the podcasting company odeo  dorsey  then an undergraduate student at new york university  introduced the idea of an individual using an sms service to communicate with a small group      the original project code name for the service was twttr  an idea that williams later ascribed to noah glass    inspired by flickr and the five character length of american sms short codes  the developers initially considered         as a short code  but later changed it to         for  ease of use and memorability     work on the project started on march           when dorsey published the first twitter message at      pm pacific standard time  pst    just setting up my twttr    dorsey has explained the origin of the  twitter  title        we came across the word  twitter   and it was just perfect  the definition was  a short burst of inconsequential information   and  chirps from birds   and that s exactly what the product was       the first twitter prototype  developed by dorsey and contractor florian weber  was used as an internal service for odeo employees   and the full version was introduced publicly on july               in october       biz stone  evan williams  dorsey  and other members of odeo  formed obvious corporation and acquired odeo  together with its assets including odeo com and twitter com from the investors and shareholders    williams fired glass  who was silent about his part in twitter s startup until         twitter spun off into its own company in april         williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a      interview     with twitter  it wasn t clear what it was  they called it a social network  they called it microblogging  but it was hard to define  because it didn t replace anything  there was this path of discovery with something like that  where over time you figure out what it is  twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning  which we described as status updates and a social utility  it is that  in part  but the insight we eventually came to was twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network       the tipping point for twitter s popularity was the      south by southwest interactive  sxswi  conference  during the event  twitter usage increased from       xa tweets per day to            the twitter people cleverly placed two    inch plasma screens in the conference hallways  exclusively streaming twitter messages   remarked newsweek s steven levy   hundreds of conference goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters  panelists and speakers mentioned the service  and the bloggers in attendance touted it        reaction at the conference was highly positive  blogger scott beale said that

technology author steven johnson described the basic mechanics of twitter as  remarkably simple         as a social network  twitter revolves around the principle of followers  when you choose to follow another twitter user  that user s tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main twitter page  if you follow    people  you ll see a mix of tweets scrolling down the page  breakfast cereal updates  interesting new links  music recommendations  even musings on the future of education     according to research published in april       around    percent of user accounts have never tweeted        san antonio based market research firm pear analytics analyzed       tweets  originating from the united states and in english  over a two week period in august      from       am to      pm  cst  and separated them into six categories        despite jack dorsey s own open contention that a message on twitter is  a short burst of inconsequential information   social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the pear analytics survey by arguing that what the pear researchers labelled  pointless babble  is better characterized as  social grooming  and or  peripheral awareness   which she justifies as persons  wanting to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling  even when co presence isn t viable       similarly  a survey of twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers        users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags   words or phrases prefixed with a     sign  similarly  the     sign followed by a username is used for mentioning or replying to other users     to repost a message from another twitter user and share it with one s own followers  a user can click the retweet button within the tweet     in late       the  twitter lists  feature was added  making it possible for users to follow  as well as mention and reply to  ad hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors          through sms  users can communicate with twitter through five gateway numbers  short codes for the united states  canada  india  new zealand  and an isle of man based number for international use  there is also a short code in the united kingdom which is only accessible to those on the vodafone  o     and orange    networks  in india  since twitter only supports tweets from bharti airtel     an alternative platform called smstweet    was set up by a user to work on all networks     a similar platform called gladlycast exists for mobile phone users in singapore  malaysia  and the philippines        the tweets were set to a largely constrictive     character limit for compatibility with sms messaging  introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in sms messages  the     character limit has also increased the usage of url shortening services such as bit ly  goo gl  and tr im  and content hosting services  such as twitpic  memozu com and notepub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than     characters  since june       twitter has used its own t co domain for automatic shortening of all urls posted on its website           a word  phrase or topic that is tagged at a greater rate than other tags is said to be a  trending topic   trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users  or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic     these topics help twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world        trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena  particularly musicians like lady gaga  known as little monsters   justin bieber  beliebers   and one direction  directioners   and fans of the twilight  twihards   rihanna fans  rih navy   and harry potter  potterheads  novels  twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type to limited success        twitter s march          blog post announced that the hottest twitter trending topics would scroll across the twitter homepage        there have been controversies surrounding twitter trending topics  twitter has censored hashtags that other users found offensive  twitter censored the  thatsafrican    and the  thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive     there are allegations that twitter removed  namoinhyd from the trending list and added an indian national congress sponsored hashtag        there are numerous tools for adding content  monitoring content and conversations including telly  video sharing  old name is twitvid      tweetdeck  salesforce com  hootsuite  and twitterfeed  as of       fewer than half of tweets were posted using the web user interface with most users using third party applications  based on analysis of     million tweets by sysomos         a verified twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account the aim of the  verified  status is to prevent impersonation through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the top right corner of a user s page  or next to the username in the platform s search function     twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark  and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics  music  movies  business  fashion  government  sports  media  and journalism        the owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard twitter account holders     these features include the following     twitter has mobile apps for iphone  ipad  android  windows phone  blackberry  firefox os  and nokia s       there is also version of the website for mobile devices  sms and mms service     twitter limits the use of third party applications utilizing the service by implementing a         user limit        as of august           third party twitter applications are required to use oauth  an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application  previously  the oauth authentication method was optional  it is now compulsory and the user name password authentication method has been made redundant and is no longer functional  twitter stated that the move to oauth will mean  increased security and a better experience         this feature adds websites to the bottom of a tweet s permalink page  if a website embedded a tweet onto one of their stories  the tweet will show the websites that mentioned the tweet  this feature was added onto twitter so if the viewer doesn t understand what the tweet means  they can click on the sites to read more about what the person is talking about        twitter is ranked as one of the ten most visited websites worldwide by alexa s web traffic analysis     daily user estimates vary as the company does not publish statistics on active accounts  a february      compete com blog entry ranked

implementation of ruby        in the early days of twitter  tweets were stored in mysql databases that were temporally sharded  large databases were split based on time of posting   after the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases  the company decided that the system needed re engineering        as of april          twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their ruby on rails search stack  to a java server they call blender      from spring      to      the messages were handled by a ruby persistent queue server called starling     but since      implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in scala     the switch from ruby to scala and the jvm has given twitter a performance boost from         requests per second per host to around               requests per second per host  this boost was greater than the   x improvement that twitter s engineers envisioned when starting the switch  the continued development of twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls        individual tweets are registered under unique ids using software called snowflake  and geolocation data is added using  rockdove   the url shortner t co then checks for a spam link and shortens the url  next  the tweets are stored in a mysql database using gizzard  and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent  tweets are then sent to search engines via the firehose api  the process itself is managed by flockdb and takes an average of     ms        on august           twitter s vice president of platform engineering raffi krikorian shared in a blog post that the company s infrastructure handled almost         tweets per second during that week  setting a new record  krikorian explained that twitter achieved this record by blending its

based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads    directed specifically to the user     a security vulnerability was reported on april          by nitesh dhanjani and rujith  since twitter used the phone number of the sender of an sms message as authentication  malicious users could update someone else s status page by using sms spoofing     the vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim s account  within a few weeks of this discovery  twitter introduced an optional personal identification number  pin  that its users could use to authenticate their sms originating messages        on january            xa high profile twitter accounts were compromised after a twitter administrator s password was guessed by a dictionary

set to follow only one person  was changed to receive nearly     malicious subscriptions        in response to twitter s security breaches  the us federal trade commission  ftc  brought charges against the service  the charges were settled on june           this was the first time the ftc had taken action against a social network for security lapses  the settlement requires twitter to take a number of steps to secure users  private information  including maintenance of a  comprehensive information security program  to be independently audited biannually        on december           the united states department of justice issued a subpoena directing twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with wikileaks     twitter decided to notify its users and said

occurred on september           when an xss worm became active on twitter  when a user held the mouse cursor over blacked out parts of a tweet  the worm within the script would automatically open links and re post itself on the reader s account     the exploit was then re used to post pop up ads and links to pornographic sites  the origin of the worm is unclear  but pearce h  delphin  known on twitter as  zzap  and a scandinavian developer  magnus holm  both claim to modified a related exploit found by another user  possibly masato kinugawa  who was using it to create coloured tweets     kinugawa  a japanese developer  reported the xss vulnerability to twitter on august     later  when he found it was exploitable again  he created the account  rainbowtwtr  and used it to post coloured messages     delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a javascript function for  onmouseover      and holm later created and posted the xss worm that automatically re tweeted itself     security firm sophos reported that the virus was spread by people doing it for  fun and games   but noted it could be exploited by cybercriminals     twitter issued a statement on their status blog at       utc that  the exploit is fully patched         twitter representative carolyn penner said no charges would be pressed        in may       a claimant known as  ctb   subsequently identified as ryan giggs  in the case of ctb v twitter inc   persons unknown took legal action at the high court of justice in london against twitter     requesting that twitter release details of account holders  this followed gossip posted on twitter about giggs  private life  causing conflict relating to privacy injunctions        tony wang  the head of twitter in europe  said that people who do  bad things  on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy  and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so     he also suggested that twitter would accede to a uk court order to divulge names of users responsible for  illegal activity  on the site        on may           it

connection with the incidents        in august       twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and  authorized individuals

frankly ashamed  at how poorly twitter handled trolling and abuse  and admitted twitter had lost users as a result        twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service     a page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used  from revision control software like git to programming languages such as ruby and scala     software released as open source by the company includes the gizzard scala framework for creating distributed datastores  the distributed graph database flockdb  the finagle library for building asynchronous rpc servers and clients  the twui user interface framework for ios  and the bower client side package manager        the popular twitter bootstrap web design library was also started at twitter and is the most popular repository on github        on april           twitter announced it would implement an  innovators patent agreement

available for links posted to twitter and not available for general use     all links posted to twitter use a t co wrapper     twitter hopes that the service will be able to protect users from malicious sites     and will use it to track clicks on links within tweets           having previously used the services of third parties tinyurl and bit ly     twitter began experimenting with its own url shortening service for private messages in march      using the twt tl domain     before it purchased the t co domain  the service was tested on the main site using the accounts  twitterapi

uploaded on twitter and third party services such as twitpic        a twitterbot is a computer program that automatically posts on twitter  they are programmed to tweet  retweet  and follow other accounts  according to a recent report  there were    million  fewer than     of accounts on twitter that were fraudulent in       these fake accounts are often used to build large follower populations quickly for advertisers  while others respond to tweets that include a certain word or phrase     these  bots  embody the automation of modern life as they connect directly to twitter s mainline computing the information they intake and posting on a whim  twitter s wide open application programming interface and cloud servers make it possible for twitterbots  existence within the social networking site        twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios  for example  it has been used to organize protests  sometimes referred to as  twitter revolutions   which include the      egyptian revolution            tunisian protests            iranian election protests  and      moldova civil unrest     the governments of iran and egypt blocked the service in retaliation        the hill on february          described twitter and other social media as a  strategic weapon     which have the apparent ability to re align the social order in real time  with little or no advanced warning      during the arab spring in early       the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in tunisia and egypt increased     a study by the dubai school of government found that only       of the egyptian population       of the tunisian population and       of the syrian population are active on twitter        the service is also used as a form of civil disobedience  in       users expressed outrage over the twitter joke trial by making obvious jokes about terrorism     and in the british privacy injunction debate in the same country a year later  where several celebrities who had taken out anonymised injunctions  most notably the manchester united player ryan giggs  were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored        another  more real time and practical use for twitter exists as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news  it was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication  but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators  who knew that the service could have wide reaching effects early on when the san francisco  california company used it to communicate during earthquakes     the boston police tweeted news of the arrest of the      boston marathon bombing suspect     another practical use that is being studied is twitter s ability to track epidemics and how they spread     in addition  twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires           twitter has been used by somalia s al shabaab rebels  who had their accounts suspended after they used the site to claim responsibility for an attack on the westgate shopping mall in nairobi in september                twitter has been blocked intermittently in numerous countries including china  iran  iraq  egypt  venezuelan  turkey on different bases                 in may       the wall street journal wrote that social networking services such as twitter  elicit mixed feelings in the technology savvy people who have been their early adopters  fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends  but some users are starting to feel  too  connected  as they grapple with check in messages at odd hours  higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they re having for dinner         twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational settings mostly in colleges and universities        it has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions  especially in large lecture courses     research has found that using twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty  promotes informal learning  allows shy students a forum for increased participation  increases student engagement  and improves overall course grades              tech writer bruce sterling commented in      that using twitter for  literate communication  is  about as likely as firing up a cb radio and hearing some guy recite the iliad      in september       the journalist clive thompson mused in a the new york times magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into  a new  supermetabolic extreme the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world      one of the earliest documented forms of celebrity related twitter like disclosures dates from       when real estate mogul william desmond ryan made round the clock press releases about his relationship with comedienne phyllis diller  even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis     conversely  vancouver sun columnist steve dotto opined that part of twitter s appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints     and jonathan zittrain  professor of internet law at harvard law school  said that  the qualities that make twitter seem inane and half baked are what makes it so powerful         the novelist rick moody wrote a short story for electric literature called  some contemporary characters   composed entirely of tweets        in       nielsen online reported that twitter has a user retention rate of forty percent  many people stop using the service after a month  therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all internet users     in       twitter won the  breakout of the year  webby award        during a february      discussion on national public radio s weekend edition  the journalist daniel schorr stated that twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous fact checking and other editorial improvements  in response  andy carvin gave schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on twitter and said users wanted first hand accounts and sometimes debunked stories     on november          twitter was named the word of the year by the global language monitor  declaring it  a new form of social interaction      time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its      time      to determine the influence of people  it used a formula based on famous social networking sites  twitter and facebook  the list ranges from barack obama and oprah winfrey to lady gaga and ashton kutcher        the u s  government  seeing social media s role in the      arab spring revolts  covertly developed a cuban alternative to twitter called zunzuneo as part of a long term strategy to  stir unrest   the service was active from      to             during the      summer olympics opening ceremony  in which he appeared at the london olympic stadium in person     sir tim berners lee  the founder of the world wide web  tweeted  this is for everyone      which was instantly spelled out in lcd lights attached to the chairs of the        people in the audience        world leaders and their diplomats have taken note of twitter s rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing twitter diplomacy  the use of twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens  us ambassador to russia  michael a  mcfaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international twitter diplomacy  he used twitter after becoming ambassador in       posting in english and russian     on october           queen elizabeth ii sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the london science museum s information age exhibition     a      study by website twiplomacy found that     of the     countries represented at the united nations had established government twitter accounts     the same study also found that those accounts amounted to     twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers  with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over     million followers        according to an analysis of accounts  the heads of state of     countries and     other leading politicians have twitter accounts that have between them sent more than         tweets and have almost    million followers  however  only    of these do their own tweeting  more than    do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts        more than twenty roman catholic cardinals manage active twitter accounts     nine of whom were cardinal electors for the      papal conclave        twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture  products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication     the new york times states   they have sleep wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing  making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs      the tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing  all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot  the social implications these twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the sciencedirect journal  looking at the computers as social actors  casa  paradigm  the journal notes   people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media  treating them as if they were real people or real places   the study concluded that twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere     while the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful human computer interaction  the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the twitter realm  benign twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular  push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation  spam and or slander        in addition to content generating bots  users can purchase followers  favorites  retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers  with more followers  users  profiles gain more attention  thus increasing their popularity     generating web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability     with twitterbots  users are able to create the illusion of  buzz  on their site by obtaining followers from services such as swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms        the companies that facilitate this service create fake twitter accounts that follow a number of people  some of these twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real  this practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on twitter     the emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities  politicians  musicians  public figures  and companies alike     according to the new york times  bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections  influence the stock market  public appeal  and attack governments        after claims in the media that the hashtags  wikileaks and  occupywallstreet were being censored because they did not show up on the site s list of trending topics  twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags unless they contain obscenities              according to documents leaked by edward snowden and published in july       the united kingdom s gchq has a tool named birdsong for  automated posting of twitter updates   and a tool named birdstrike for  twitter monitoring and profile collection            twitter is also increasingly used for making tv more interactive and social     this effect is sometimes referred to as the  virtual watercooler  or social television   the practice has been called  chatterboxing      twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live tv events  such as the oscars  the super bowl    and the mtv video music awards  however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled tv shows     such direct cross promotions have been banned from french television due to regulations against secret advertising        in december       twitter and nielsen entered a multi year agreement to produce social tv

verified profiles and embeddable posts  it also opened up new data visualization apis for tv news and other media outlets  enabling them to search for a word and see a firehose of public posts that

facebook struck the partnership to help marketers understand how people are using the social network to talk about topics such as tv     however  twitter responded by acquiring secondsync and parisian social tv firm mesagraph three months later  these acquisitions  as well as a partnership with research company kantar  which it had been working with to develop a suite of analytics tools for the
