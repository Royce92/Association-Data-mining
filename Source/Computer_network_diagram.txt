 a computer network diagram is a schematic depicting the nodes and connections amongst nodes in a computer network or  more generally  any telecommunications network             readily identifiable icons are used to depict common network appliances e g  router  and the style of lines between them indicate the type of connection  clouds are used to represent networks external to the one pictured for the purposes of depicting connections between internal and external devices  without indicating the specifics of the outside network  for example  in the hypothetical local area network pictured to the right  three personal computers and a server are connected to a switch  the server is further connected to a printer and a gateway router  which is connected via a wan link to the internet      depending on whether the diagram is intended for formal or informal use  certain details may be lacking and must be determined from context  for example  the sample diagram does not indicate the physical type of connection between the pcs and the switch  but since a modern lan is depicted  ethernet may be assumed  if the same style of line was used in a wan  wide area network  diagram  however  it may indicate a different physical connection     at different scales diagrams may represent various levels of network granularity  at the lan level  individual nodes may represent individual physical devices  such as hubs or file servers  while at the wan level  individual nodes may represent entire cities  in addition  when the scope of a diagram crosses the common lan man wan boundaries  representative hypothetical devices may be depicted instead of showing all actually existing nodes  for example  if a network appliance is intended to be connected through the internet to many end user mobile devices  only a single such device may be depicted for the purposes of showing the general relationship between the appliance and any such device     cisco uses its own brand of networking symbols  since cisco has a large internet presence and designs a broad variety of network devices  its list of symbols   network topology icons   is exhaustive      the physical network topology can be directly represented in a network diagram  as it is simply the physical graph represented by the diagrams  with network nodes as vertices and connections as undirected or direct edges  depending on the type of connection    the logical network topology can be inferred from the network diagram if details of the network protocols in use are also given     virtual private network    enterprise private network    overlay network collapsed    overlay network broken up    xdsl to internet connectivity    triple play illustration    internet distribution and core    internet  access to core
