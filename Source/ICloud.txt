keynote speech  iwork for icloud was announced for release at the same time as the next version of the app versions of iwork later in the year  the three apps for both ios and os x that form apple s iwork suite  pages  numbers  and keynote   will be made available on a web interface  named as pages for icloud  numbers for icloud  and keynote for icloud respectively   and accessed via the icloud website under each users icloud apple id login  they will also sync with the users ios and os x versions of the app  should they have them  again via their icloud apple id     this allows the user to edit and create documents on the web  using one of the supported browsers  currently safari  chrome  and internet explorer  it also means that microsoft windows users now have access to these native  previously only apple device  document editing tools  via the web interface     photo stream is a service supplied with the basic icloud service which allows users to store the most recent       photos on the icloud servers up to    days free of charge  when a photo is taken on a device with photo stream enabled  it is automatically uploaded to the icloud servers  from there  it is automatically pushed to the rest of the user s registered devices  photos in photo stream will automatically be removed from other devices after the user reaches the       photo or    day limit  users who utilize photo stream on their mac or pc can choose to have all photos permanently saved on their computer   their photos in photo stream will not be removed from the computer when they are dropped out of photo stream after the user reaches the       photo or    day limit  the service is also integrated with apple tv  allowing users to view their recent photos wirelessly on their hdtv       icloud photos is a new feature on ios     and coming to os x yosemite  version        from early       plus web app access available now  the service stores all of the users photos  maintaining their original resolution and metadata  users can access their icloud photo library on supported devices via the new photos app when available or via the icloud photo library web app at icloud com  which helps limit the amount of local storage each device needs to use in order to store photos  particularly those with smaller storage capacities  by storing lower resolution versions on the device  with the user having the option to keep some all stored locally at higher resolution     since introduction in       each account has  xa gb of free storage for owners of either an ios device using ios   x or later  or a mac using os x lion      or later  users can purchase additional storage for a total of   gb     gb     gb or  tb  the amount of storage is shared across all devices per icloud apple id       several native features of icloud use each user s icloud storage allowance  specifically  backup and restore  and email  contacts  and calendars  on macs  users can also store most filetypes into icloud folders of their choosing  rather than only storing them locally on the machine  while photo stream uses the icloud servers  usage does not come out of the user s icloud storage allowance  this is also true for itunes match music content  even for music that is not sold in the itunes store and which gets uploaded into icloud storage  it does not count against the user s allowance  other apps can optionally integrate app storage out of the user s icloud storage allowance     not all of a user s content counts as part of their icloud storage allowance  apple is able to keep a permanent track of every purchase a user makes under their apple id account  and by associating each piece of content with the user  means only one copy of every store item is needed to be kept on apple s servers  for items bought from the itunes store  music  music videos  movies  tv shows   ibooks store  books   or app store  ios apps   this uses a service apple call itunes in the cloud  allowing the user to automatically  or manually if preferred  re download any of their previous purchases on to a mac  pc  or ios device    downloaded  or streamed  provided the user is connected to the internet  itunes store content can be used across all these devices  however while ibooks store and app store content can be downloaded to macs and pcs for syncing to ios devices  only ios and mac devices   and their respective apps   can be used to read the books    similarly  os x apps purchased from the mac app store are also linked to the apple id they were purchased through  and are able to be downloaded to any mac using the same apple id  also  when a user registers any new device  all previously bought store content can be downloaded from the store servers  or non store content from the icloud servers       icloud drive is icloud s file hosting service for devices running ios    os x yosemite  version         or windows   or later  plus online web app access via icloud com  this feature allows users to save photos  videos  documents  pages  numbers  keynote  or any other type   music  and other apps  data on icloud  users can start their work on one device and continue on another device    by default  users will still get  xa gb of storage for free as previously  but the expandable storage plans available have increased considerably in size  up to  xa tb of space  and altered to monthly subscription options from the yearly ones offered under the previous non icloud drive service     activation lock was introduced in      with ios    it is integrated with icloud and find my iphone feature  this new feature locks the activation of any idevice which has been restored in either dfu or recovery mode without first disabling the find my iphone feature once restore completed  the idevice will ask for the email that has been previously associated with it  in order to proceed with activation  ultimately preventing any stolen idevice from being usable citation needed the main criticism around this new feature is that it can lock out legitimate owners  while apple hasn t offered an option to prove ownership of an idevice citation needed a tool was released  by doulci team  to bypass this feature  until apple released a patch disabling this tool citation needed    there are subdirectory  private  access points to each icloud user s individual account web apps via the main icloud com portal  once signed in  these provide web access to each icloud user s account via direct links to each web app     as well as private subdirectory access points  the previous similar mobileme service also had subdomains for public access to certain user account functions  which are not offered in icloud     icloud account creation requires either an ios device running ios   or later or a mac running os x lion v       or later       online access to icloud requires a compatible web browser  and certain features are have their own minimum requirements of os versions e g  using icloud photo sharing requires os x mavericks v     or above on a mac       devices running older versions of os x  before mavericks  or ios  below    may be unable to sign in to icloud after the icloud password has been changed  the only resolution for this issue is to upgrade the os  which may be impossible on a device that does not meet the newer os  minimum requirements       synchronizing with a pc requires windows   or windows   and using the icloud control panel  and optionally outlook      or later to sync calendar  contacts and reminders     synchronization of bookmarks requires safari       or later on os x  and internet explorer    firefox    or google chrome    or later on windows       mobileme account users could move their accounts to be an icloud account  keeping the same account details       icloud has been criticized by third party developers for bugs that make some features nearly unusable  specifically the use of core data in icloud  for storing and syncing larger amounts of data between third party apps on users  devices        which apple is attempting to address with the release of ios   and os x mavericks  version             icloud communications  a telecommunications company in arizona  sued apple in june      for trademark infringement shortly after apple announced icloud      the lawsuit was filed in the us district court of arizona and demanded that apple stop using the icloud name and pay unspecified monetary damages  icloud communications changed its name to clear digital communications in august      and dropped its lawsuit against apple shortly thereafter       icloud data is kept encrypted on apple servers  but apple keeps a master key that can be used to decrypt it when required to do so by government agencies       in august       it was rumoured that hackers had discovered an exploit involving the find my iphone service  which potentially allowed an attacker to brute force a user s apple id and access their icloud data  the exploit was later incorrectly rumoured to have been used as part of an august      leak of a large number of private  nude photos of celebrities that had been synced to their icloud storage from their iphone  apple confirmed that it was working with law enforcement agencies to investigate the leak        apple subsequently denied that the icloud service itself or the alleged exploit was responsible for the leak  asserting that the leaks were the result of a very targeted phishing attack against the celebrities    on september          tim cook  while being interviewed by charlie rose  stated on camera that the celebrity leaks were not an icloud exploit at all  but rather the celebrities had been phished by very targeted phishing to trick them out of their login credentials       subsequently  when announcing applepay  apple ceo tim cook announced a raft of measures to beef up security including promoting increased awareness of their two factor authentication process
