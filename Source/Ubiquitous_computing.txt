 ubiquitous computing  ubicomp  is a concept in software engineering and computer science where computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere  in contrast to desktop computing  ubiquitous computing can occur using any device  in any location  and in any format  a user interacts with the computer  which can exist in many different forms  including laptop computers  tablets and terminals in everyday objects such as a fridge or a pair of glasses  the underlying technologies to support ubiquitous computing include internet  advanced middleware  operating system  mobile code  sensors  microprocessors  new i o and user interfaces  networks  mobile protocols  location and positioning and new materials     this new paradigm is also described as pervasive computing  ambient intelligence   ambient media  or  everyware    each term emphasizes slightly different aspects  when primarily concerning the objects involved  it is also known as physical computing  the internet of things  haptic computing   and  things that think   rather than propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing and for these related terms  a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed  from which different kinds or flavors of ubiquitous systems and applications can be described      ubiquitous computing touches on a wide range of research topics  including distributed computing  mobile computing  location computing  mobile networking  context aware computing  sensor networks  human computer interaction  and artificial intelligence             at their core  all models of ubiquitous computing share a vision of small  inexpensive  robust networked processing devices  distributed at all scales throughout everyday life and generally turned to distinctly common place ends  for example  a domestic ubiquitous computing environment might interconnect lighting and environmental controls with personal biometric monitors woven into clothing so that illumination and heating conditions in a room might be modulated  continuously and imperceptibly  another common scenario posits refrigerators  aware  of their suitably tagged contents  able to both plan a variety of menus from the food actually on hand  and warn users of stale or spoiled food     ubiquitous computing presents challenges across computer science  in systems design and engineering  in systems modelling  and in user interface design  contemporary human computer interaction models  whether command line  menu driven  or gui based  are inappropriate and inadequate to the ubiquitous case  this suggests that the  natural  interaction paradigm appropriate to a fully robust ubiquitous computing has yet to emerge   although there is also recognition in the field that in many ways we are already living in a ubicomp world  see also the main article on natural user interface   contemporary devices that lend some support to this latter idea include mobile phones  digital audio players  radio frequency identification tags  gps  and interactive whiteboards     mark weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices  see also smart device   tabs  pads and boards     these three forms proposed by weiser are characterized by being macro sized  having a planar form and on incorporating visual output displays  if we relax each of these three characteristics we can expand this range into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices  hence  three additional forms for ubiquitous systems have been proposed      in his book the rise of the network society  manuel castells suggests that there is an ongoing shift from already decentralised  stand alone microcomputers and mainframes towards entirely pervasive computing  in his model of a pervasive computing system  castells uses the example of the internet as the start of a pervasive computing system  the logical progression from that paradigm is a system where that networking logic becomes applicable in every realm of daily activity  in every location and every context  castells envisages a system where billions of miniature  ubiquitous inter communication devices will be spread worldwide   like pigment in the wall paint      ubiquitous computing may be seen to consist of many layers  each with their own roles  which together form a single system     layer    task management layer    layer    environment management layer    layer    environment layer    mark weiser coined the phrase  ubiquitous computing  around       during his tenure as chief technologist of the xerox palo alto research center  parc   both alone and with parc director and chief scientist john seely brown  weiser wrote some of the earliest papers on the subject  largely defining it and sketching out its major concerns        recognizing that the extension of processing power into everyday scenarios would necessitate understandings of social  cultural and psychological phenomena beyond its proper ambit  weiser was influenced by many fields outside computer science  including  philosophy  phenomenology  anthropology  psychology  post modernism  sociology of science and feminist criticism   he was explicit about  the humanistic origins of the  invisible ideal in post modernist thought     referencing as well the ironically dystopian philip k  dick novel ubik     andy hopper from cambridge university uk proposed and demonstrated the concept of  teleporting    where applications follow the user wherever he she moves     roy want  while a researcher and student working under andy hopper at cambridge university  worked on the  active badge system   which is an advanced location computing system where personal mobility that is merged with computing     bill schilit  now at google  also did some earlier work in this topic  and participated in the early mobile computing workshop held in santa cruz in          dr  ken sakamura of the university of tokyo  japan leads the ubiquitous networking laboratory  unl   tokyo as well as the t engine forum  the joint goal of sakamura s ubiquitous networking specification and the t engine forum  is to enable any everyday device to broadcast and receive information        mit has also contributed significant research in this field  notably things that think consortium  directed by hiroshi ishii  joseph a  paradiso and rosalind picard  at the media lab   and the csail effort known as project oxygen    other major contributors include university of washington s ubicomp lab  directed by shwetak patel   georgia tech s college of computing  cornell university s people aware computing lab  nyu s interactive telecommunications program  uc irvine s department of informatics  microsoft research  intel research and equator    ajou university ucri   cus       one of the earliest ubiquitous systems was artist natalie jeremijenko s  live wire   also known as  dangling string   installed at xerox parc during mark weiser s time there  this was a piece of string attached to a stepper motor and controlled by a lan connection  network activity caused the string to twitch  yielding a peripherally noticeable indication of traffic  weiser called this an example of calm technology       a present manifestation of this trend is the widespread diffusion of mobile phones  many of mobile phones supporting high speed data transmission  video services  and mobile devices with powerful computational ability  although these mobile devices are not necessarily manifestations of ubiquitous computing  there are examples  such as japan s yaoyorozu   eight million gods   project in which mobile devices  coupled with radio frequency identification tags demonstrate that ubiquitous computing is already present in some form       ambient devices has produced an  orb   a  dashboard   and a  weather beacon   these decorative devices receive data from a wireless network and report current events  such as stock prices and the weather  like the nabaztag produced by violet snowden     the australian futurist mark pesce has produced a highly configurable    led lamp enabled lamp which uses wi fi named moorescloud after moore s law       the unified computer intelligence corporation has launched a device called ubi   the ubiquitous computer that is designed to allow voice interaction with the home and provide constant access to information       ubiquitous computing research has focused on building an environment in which computers allow humans to focus attention on select aspects of the environment and operate in supervisory and policy making roles  ubiquitous computing emphasizes the creation of a human computer interface that can interpret and support a user s intentions  for example  mit s project oxygen seeks to create a system in which computation is as pervasive as air     in the future  computation will be human centered  it will be freely available everywhere  like batteries and power sockets  or oxygen in the air we breathe we will not need to carry our own devices around with us  instead  configurable generic devices  either handheld or embedded in the environment  will bring computation to us  whenever we need it and wherever we might be  as we interact with these  anonymous  devices  they will adopt our information personalities  they will respect our desires for privacy and security  we won t have to type  click  or learn new computer jargon  instead  we ll communicate naturally  using speech and gestures that describe our intent     this is a fundamental transition that does not seek to escape the physical world and  enter some metallic  gigabyte infested cyberspace  but rather brings computers and communications to us  making them  synonymous with the useful tasks they perform        network robots link ubiquitous networks with robots  contributing to the creation of new lifestyles and solutions to address a variety of social problems including the aging of population and nursing care       privacy is easily the most often cited criticism of ubiquitous computing  ubicomp   and may be the greatest barrier to its long term success       these are the kinds of privacy principles that have been established by the industry   but over the past two years  we have been trying to understand whether such principles reflect the concerns of the ordinary citizen  some of the key research questions we have been addressing are  what are users  key concerns regarding privacy management in a ubiquitous context and do they reflect  expert  privacy principles  do these concerns vary as a function of context  will users have enough confidence in privacy management procedures to hand over management and administration of their privacy preferences  motahari  et al          argue people do not have a complete understanding of the threats to their privacy  while users of ubicomp systems are aware of inappropriate use of their personal information  legal obligations and inadequate security they are less aware of setting preferences for who has access and any social inferences that can be made by observations by other people  they further argue a holistic approach is needed as traditional approaches and current investigations are not enough to address privacy threats in ubiquitous computing  recognising   in line with a number of other researchers  harper   singleton        paine  et al           that privacy concerns are likely to be highly situation dependent  we have developed a method of enquiry which displays a rich context to the user in order to elicit more detailed information about those privacy factors that underpin our acceptance of ubiquitous computing       public policy problems are often  preceded by long shadows  long trains of activity   emerging slowly  over decades or even the course of a century  there is a need for a long term view to guide policy decision making  as this will assist in identifying long term problems or opportunities related to the ubiquitous computing environment  this information can reduce uncertainty and guide the decisions of both policy makers and those directly involved in system development  wedemeyer et al         one important consideration is the degree to which different opinions form around a single problem  some issues may have strong consensus about their importance  even if there are great differences in opinion regarding the cause or solution  for example  few people will differ in their assessment of a highly tangible problem with physical impact such as terrorists using new weapons of mass destruction to destroy human life  the problem statements outlined above that address the future evolution of the human species or challenges to identity have clear cultural or religious implications and are likely to have greater variance in opinion about them       there is still the issue  what actually  content  is in an ubiquitous environment  where in other media environment the interface is clearly distinct  in an ubiquitous environment  content  differs  artur lugmayr defined such a smart environment by describing it as ambient media  it is constituted of the communication of information in ubiquitous and pervasive environments  the concept of ambient media relates to ambient media form  ambient media content  and ambient media technology  it s principles have been established by artur lugmayr and are manifestation  morphing  intelligence  and experience
