 microsoft silverlight is an application framework for writing and running rich internet applications  similar to adobe flash  a plugin for silverlight is available for many web browsers  while early versions of silverlight focused on streaming media  current versions support multimedia  graphics  and animation  and give developers support for cli languages and development tools  silverlight is also one of the two application development platforms for windows phone  but web pages which use silverlight cannot run on the windows phone or windows mobile versions of internet explorer  as there is no silverlight plugin for internet explorer on those platforms      over the course of about five years microsoft released five versions  the first version was released in       and the fifth  and final  major version on may          it is compatible with later versions of internet explorer  mozilla firefox  and google chrome web browsers on microsoft windows  except windows rt  operating systems   with firefox and safari under mac and os x  and with mobile devices using the windows mobile  and symbian  series      platforms     in       microsoft announced that they had ceased development on silverlight except for patches and bugfixes  microsoft announced the end of life of silverlight   in       silverlight is no longer supported in chrome on os x  while support for silverlight in chrome on all other operating systems will be disabled by default in april      and removed completely in september        microsoft has set the support end date for silverlight   to be october            silverlight was used to provide video streaming for the nbc coverage of the      summer olympics in beijing    the      winter olympics in vancouver    and the      conventions for both major united states political parties    silverlight is also used by netflix for its instant video streaming service    but netflix said in its tech blog in      that  since microsoft announced the end of life  they were moving to html  video               silverlight provides a retained mode graphics system similar to windows presentation foundation  wpf   and integrates multimedia  graphics  animations and interactivity into a single run time environment  in silverlight applications  user interfaces are declared in extensible application markup language  xaml  and programmed using a subset of the  net framework  xaml can be used for marking up the vector graphics and animations  silverlight can also be used to create windows sidebar gadgets for windows vista       silverlight supports h     video  advanced audio coding  windows media video  wmv   windows media audio  wma  and mpeg layer iii  mp   media content   across all supported browsers without requiring windows media player  the windows media player activex control or windows media browser plug ins  because windows media video   is an implementation of the society of motion picture and television engineers  smpte  vc   standard  silverlight also supports vc   video  according to the end user license agreement vc   and h     are only licensed for the  personal and non commercial use of a consumer     silverlight  since version    supports the playback of h     video    silverlight makes it possible to dynamically load extensible markup language  xml  content that can be manipulated through a document object model  dom  interface  a technique that is consistent with conventional ajax techniques  silverlight exposes a downloader object which can be used to download content  like scripts  media assets or other data  as may be required by the application    with version    the programming logic can be written in any  net language  including some derivatives of common dynamic programming languages like ironruby and ironpython       a free software implementation named moonlight  developed by novell in cooperation with microsoft  was released to bring silverlight versions   and   functionality to linux  freebsd and other open source platforms   although some linux distributions did not include it  citing redistribution and patent concerns    however  in may       moonlight was abandoned because of its lack of popularity       according to statowl com  microsoft silverlight had a penetration of        on may       usage on july      was         whereas as of may     update market leader adobe flash was installed on        of browsers  and java was supported on        of browsers    support of these plugins is not mutually exclusive  one system can support all three  not all web sites require a browser plugin  of those that do  as of    august     update  fewer than      sites used silverlight and java        used adobe flash    although another source cites around    for java       silverlight requires an x   processor with streaming simd extensions  sse  support  supported processors include the intel pentium iii and up  the amd athlon xp and up  and newer amd durons     the following table presents an availability and compatibility matrix of silverlight versions for various operating systems and web browsers     upcoming opera support was promised since may          when david storey  the chief web opener at opera  revealed a microsoft poster for mix conference that had shown opera integration as a part of silverlight        as of january     update  however  silverlight still does not officially support opera  silverlight     could be made to work with opera via a hack    starting from silverlight    hacks were no longer required       on linux and freebsd  the functionality is available via moonlight      moonlight is available for the major linux distributions  with support for firefox  konqueror  and opera browsers  provided it was obtained through novell    miguel de icaza has expressed an interest in working with developers from other operating systems  bsd  solaris  and other browsers  konqueror  webkit and opera  to ensure that moonlight works fine on their systems    availability of moonlight version     for freebsd was announced in march         but has since been reported not to actually work    as of     update the current version of moonlight    preview    does not officially work on new versions of firefox  newer than   x  on gnu linux based operating systems  however  it can be installed in an unofficial way  for example using the add on compatibility reporter add on  and with firefox    it works correctly when installed  as noted above  the moonlight project was abandoned in may      nas of     update pipelight is available  it is a plugin for linux browsers which  when combined with wine  enables windows browser plugins  including silverlight  to run       as of     update silverlight was not available on android or ios  the most prevalent operating systems on the mobile market     silverlight is the primary development environment for windows phone and is based on silverlight    for previous versions of windows mobile  the first community technology preview  ctp  for windows mobile   was expected in the second quarter of       but it still has not been officially announced  microsoft has stopped focusing on bringing silverlight to windows mobile   x    nokia has announced plans to make silverlight for mobile available for s   on symbian os  as well as for series    devices and nokia internet tablets      silverlight for mobile supports silverlight   content and  net languages   silverlight for windows phone     is based on silverlight         silverlight applications can be written in any  net programming language  as such  any development tools which can be used with  net languages can work with silverlight  provided they can target the silverlight coreclr for hosting the application  instead of the  net framework clr  microsoft has positioned microsoft expression blend as a companion tool to visual studio for the design of silverlight user interface applications  visual studio can be used to develop and debug silverlight applications  to create silverlight projects and let the compiler target coreclr  visual studio requires the silverlight tools for visual studio       a silverlight control is a zip bnj format file with extension  xap containing a list of one or more  net managed assemblies   dll files  along with the appmanifest xaml file containing this list along with the entry point  class and assembly   it can be hosted in any html file using an object tag  for example     a silverlight project contains the silverlight js and createsilverlight js files which initializes the silverlight plug in for use in html pages  a xaml file for the ui  and code behind files for the application code  silverlight applications are debugged in a manner similar to asp net applications  visual studio s clr remote cross platform debugging feature can be used to debug silverlight applications running on a different platform as well       in conjunction with the release of silverlight    eclipse was added as a development tool option       an april      to      pc world report suggested that microsoft intended to release certain parts of silverlight source code as open source software    but a week later sam ramji  director of platform technology strategy at microsoft  contradicted the rumors by confirming that the company had no plans to open silverlight    some controls that ship with silverlight are available under the microsoft public license as a part of a separate project known as the silverlight toolkit       silverlight s proprietary nature is a concern to competition since it may harm the open nature of the world wide web  advocates of free software are also concerned silverlight could be another example of microsoft s embrace  extend and extinguish strategy    both microsoft silverlight and adobe flash are proprietary    flash s file formats are publicly documented standards      as are silverlight s      however  the communication between a flash player and a server is done by the proprietary protocol rtmp  both flash and silverlight use patent encumbered audio and video codecs     the mono team abandoned development of moonlight  a free and open source implementation of both the silverlight   and   runtimes    development was discontinued in      due to the poor acceptance of silverlight and the restrictions imposed by microsoft       the project had been officially supported by microsoft which    under an agreement with novell  made not publicly available additional specifications  access to the silverlight base class library apis  binary codecs and test cases available to the mono team         the  covenant  under which novell was granted this exclusive access also specified conditions incompatible with the licensing that covers most free and open source software  as examples  it specifically required that the software must have been  obtained directly from novell or through an intermediate recipient  and that it must be  not licensed under gplv  or a similar license     some free software proponents criticized the covenant       silverlight was criticised for not living up to its cross platform operating system compatibility promises  especially on linux systems  compared to its extensive support on apple and microsoft desktops for internet explorer  firefox  and chrome  although microsoft was officially collaborating on the moonlight project  bruce chizen  ceo of adobe systems  which sells the competing proprietary flash platform  questioned  the commitment of microsoft to keep the silverlight platform compatible with other os besides windows     his concerns are based on  examples from history  where he said that microsoft had launched products with promises of ongoing cross platform compatibility that no longer apply  for example internet explorer for unix and windows media player for mac     in      california and several other u s  states asked a district judge to extend most of microsoft s antitrust case settlement for another five years    citing  a number of concerns  including the fear that microsoft could use the next version of windows to  tilt the playing field  toward silverlight  its new adobe flash competitor   says a seattle post intelligencer article  the final judgment on the motion extended the settlement two years  to november       but for reasons unrelated to silverlight    in windows   the silverlight web browser plug in is not installed automatically  but is a downloadable optional update through windows update       microsoft has been criticized for not using the scalable vector graphics  svg  standard for silverlight  which  according to ryan paul  editor of open ended  ars technica s open source software journal  is consistent with microsoft s way of ignoring open standards in other products  as well    however  according to david betz  a  net specialist and microsoft most valuable professional  mvp   microsoft would have had to alter the svg specification in order to integrate it with  net  so that  by choosing to use xaml over svg  microsoft kept svg pure by not adding proprietary technology to it        a silverlight     application hosted in internet explorer  interactivity was provided by silverlight  but user input controls are html controls overlaid on top of silverlight content     a silverlight   application hosted in internet explorer  version   brings improved interactivity and support for some native  net languages and development tools     a silverlight   application  with one instance running in google chrome as well as installed locally  the start menu icon is also shown     f
