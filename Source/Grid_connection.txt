 in electrical grids  a power system network integrates transmission grids  distribution grids  distributed generators and loads that have connection points called busses  a bus in home circuit breaker panels is much smaller than those used on the grid  where busbars can be   xa mm in diameter in electrical substations  traditionally  these grid connections are unidirectional point to multipoint links  in distributed generation grids  these connections are bidirectional  and the reverse flow can raise safety and reliability concerns   features in smart grids are designed to manage these conditions     a premises is generally said to have obtained grid connection when its service location becomes powered by a live connection to its service transformer     a power station is generally said to have achieved grid connection when it first supplies power outside of its own boundaries  however  a town is only said to have achieved grid connection when it is connected to several redundant sources  generally involving long distance transmission     template electricity
