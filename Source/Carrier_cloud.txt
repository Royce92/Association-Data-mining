 carrier cloud is a class of cloud that integrates wide area networks  wan  and other attributes of communications service providers  carrier grade networks to enable the deployment of highly demanding applications in the cloud  in contrast  classic cloud computing solutions focus on the data center and do not address the network connecting data centers and cloud users  this may result in unpredictable response times and security issues when business critical data are transferred over the internet             the advent of virtualization technology and cost effective computing hardware as well as ubiquitous internet connectivity enabled a first wave of cloud services starting in the first years of the   st century         but many businesses and other organizations hesitated to move more demanding applications from on premise dedicated hardware into private or public clouds  as a response  communications service providers started in the           time frame to develop carrier clouds that address perceived weaknesses in existing cloud services   weaknesses cited vary     but often include performance  availability  security and service level agreements  slas      to enable the deployment of time sensitive and business critical applications in the cloud  the carrier cloud is designed to match or even exceed the characteristics of on premise deployments  therefore  the carrier cloud is characterized by some or all of the following items     carrier clouds encompass data centers at different network tiers and wide area networks that connect multiple data centers to each other as well as to the cloud users  links between data centers are used  for instance  for failover  overflow  backup  and geographic diversity  carrier clouds can be set up as public  private  or hybrid clouds  the carrier cloud federates these cloud entities  using a single management system to orchestrate  manage  and monitor data center and network resources as a single system
