 security engineering is a specialized field of engineering that focuses on the security aspects in the design of systems that need to be able to deal robustly with possible sources of disruption  ranging from natural disasters to malicious acts  it is similar to other systems engineering activities in that its primary motivation is to support the delivery of engineering solutions that satisfy pre defined functional and user requirements  but with the added dimension of preventing misuse and malicious behavior  these constraints and restrictions are often asserted as a security policy     in one form or another  security engineering has existed as an informal field of study for several centuries  for example  the fields of locksmithing and security printing have been around for many years     due to recent catastrophic events  most notably       security engineering has quickly become a rapidly growing field  in fact  in a recent report completed in       it was estimated that the global security industry was valued at us     billion      security engineering involves aspects of social science  psychology  such as designing a system to  fail well  instead of trying to eliminate all sources of error  and economics  as well as physics  chemistry  mathematics  architecture and landscaping   some of the techniques used  such as fault tree analysis  are derived from safety engineering     other techniques such as cryptography were previously restricted to military applications  one of the pioneers of security engineering as a formal field of study is ross anderson             typical qualifications for a security engineer are     however  multiple qualifications  or several qualified persons working together  may provide a more complete solution      the two possible default positions on security matters are        default deny    everything  not explicitly permitted  is forbidden        default permit    everything  not explicitly forbidden  is permitted     technological advances  principally in the field of computers  have now allowed the creation of far more complex systems  with new and complex security problems  because modern systems cut across many areas of human endeavor  security engineers not only need consider the mathematical and physical properties of systems  they also need to consider attacks on the people who use and form parts of those systems using social engineering attacks  secure systems have to resist not only technical attacks  but also coercion  fraud  and deception by confidence tricksters     according to the microsoft developer network the patterns   practices of security engineering consists of the following activities     these activities are designed to help meet security objectives in the software life cycle     whatever the target  there are multiple ways of preventing penetration by unwanted or unauthorised persons  methods include placing jersey barriers  stairs or other sturdy obstacles outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and truck bombings  improving the method of visitor management and some new electronic locks take advantage of technologies such as fingerprint scanning  iris or retinal scanning  and voiceprint identification to authenticate users     some criticize this fieldwho  as not being a bona fide field of engineering because the methodologies of this field are less formal or excessively ad hoc compared to other fields and many in the practice of security engineering have no engineering degree     computer related    physical    misc  topics
