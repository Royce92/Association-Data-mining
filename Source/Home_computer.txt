 home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in       and becoming common during the     s  they were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that  for the first time  were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user  these computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business  scientific or engineering oriented computers of the time such as the ibm pc   and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability  however  a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporary business computers  their most common use was playing video games      home computers were usually not electronic kits  since the home computer was sold already manufactured  there were  however  commercial kits like the sinclair zx   which were both home and home built computers since the purchaser could assemble the unit from a kit     advertisements in the popular press for early home computers were rife with possibilities for their practical use in the home  from cataloging recipes to personal finance to home automation     but these were seldom realized in practice  for example  using a typical     s home computer as a home automation appliance would require the computer to be kept powered on at all times and dedicated to this task  personal finance and database use required tedious data entry     by contrast  advertisements in the specialty computer press often simply listed specifications    if no packaged software was available for a particular application  the home computer user was required to learn computer programming  a significant time commitment many new computer owners weren t willing to make  still  for others the home computer offered the first opportunity to learn to program      today the line between  business  and  home  computer market segments has blurred or vanished completely  since both categories of computers now typically use the same processor architectures  peripherals  operating systems  and applications  often the only difference may be the sales outlet through which they are purchased  another change from the home computer era is that the once common endeavour of writing one s own software programs has almost vanished from home computer use                as early as       some experimental projects such as jim sutherland s echo iv explored the possible utility of a computer in the home      in       the honeywell kitchen computer was marketed as a luxury gift item  and would have inaugurated the era of home computing  but none were sold       computers became affordable for the general public in the     s due to the mass production of the microprocessor starting in       early microcomputers such as the altair      had front mounted switches and blinkenlights to control and indicate internal system status  and were often sold in kit form to hobbyists  these kits would contain an empty printed circuit board which the buyer would fill with the integrated circuits  other individual electronic components  wires and connectors  and then hand solder all the connections       while two early home computers  sinclair zx    and acorn atom  could be bought either in kit form or assembled  most home computers were only sold pre assembled  they were enclosed in plastic or metal cases similar in appearance to typewriter or hi fi equipment enclosures  which were more familiar and attractive to consumers than the industrial metal card cage enclosures used by the altair and similar computers  the keyboard   a feature lacking on the altair   was usually built into the same case as the motherboard  ports for plug in peripheral devices such as a video display  cassette tape recorders  joysticks  and  later  disk drives either were built in or available on expansion cards  although the apple ii series had internal expansion slots  most other home computer models  expansion arrangements were through externally accessible  expansion ports  that also served as a place to plug in cartridge based games  usually the manufacturer would sell peripheral devices designed to be compatible with their computers as extra cost accessories  peripherals were not often interchangeable between different brands of home computer  or even between successive models of the same brand     to save the cost of a dedicated monitor  the home computer often would connect through an rf modulator to the family tv set  which served as both video display and sound system       by      an estimated         home computers were in american households  at an average sales price of         after the success of the radio shack trs     the commodore pet and the apple ii in       almost every manufacturer of consumer electronics rushed to introduce a home computer  large numbers of new machines of all types began to appear during the late     s and early     s  mattel  coleco  texas instruments and timex  none of which had any previous connection to the computer industry  all had short lived home computer lines in the early     s  some home computers were more successful the bbc micro  sinclair zx spectrum  atari    xl and commodore     sold many units over several years and attracted third party software development     almost universally  home computers had a basic interpreter combined with a line editor in permanent read only memory which one could use to type in basic programs and execute them immediately or save them to tape or disk  in direct mode  the basic interpreter was also used as the user interface  and given tasks such as loading  saving  managing  and running files    one exception was the jupiter ace  which had a forth interpreter instead of basic  a built in programming language was seen as a requirement for any computer of the era  and was the main feature setting home computers apart from video game consoles     still  home computers competed in the same market as the consoles  a home computer was often seen as simply as a higher end purchase than a console  adding abilities to what would still be mainly a gaming device  a common marketing tactic was to show a computer system and console playing games side by side  then emphasising the computer s greater ability by showing it running user created programs  education software  word processing  spreadsheet and other applications while the game console showed a blank screen or continued playing the same repetitive game     some game consoles offered  programming packs  consisting of a version of basic in a rom cartridge  atari s basic programming for the atari      was one of these  for the colecovision console  coleco even announced an expansion module which would convert it into a full fledged computer system  this never materialised  but a standalone computer  the coleco adam was eventually released    the magnavox odyssey  game console had a built in keyboard to support its c     home computer module     books of type in program listings were available for most models of computer with titles along the lines of    amazing basic games for the commodore       while most of the programs in these books were short and simple games or demos  some titles such as compute u   a u   bs speedscript series  contained productivity software that rivaled commercial packages  to avoid the tedious process of typing in a program listing from a book  these books would sometimes include a mail in offer from the author to obtain the programs on disk or cassette for a few dollars  before the internet  and before most computer owners had a modem  books were a popular and low cost means of software distribution  they also served a role in familiarizing new computer owners with the concepts of programming  some titles added suggested modifications to the program listings for the user to carry out  modifying software to be compatible with one s system or writing a utility program to fit one s needs was a skill every advanced computer owner was expected to have       during the peak years of the home computer market  scores of models were produced  usually with little or no thought given to compatibility between different manufacturers or even within product lines of the same manufacturer    except for the japanese msx standard    the concept of a computer platform was still forming  with most companies considering basic language and disk format compatibility sufficient  things were different in the business world  where cost conscious small business owners had been using cp m running on z   based computers from osborne  kaypro  morrow designs and a host of other manufacturers  for many of these businesses  the development of the microcomputer is what made computer systems affordable where they had not been before     introduced in august       the ibm personal computer would eventually become the standard platform used in business  due to the ibm name and the system s open architecture  which encouraged production of third party clones  the      based apple ii series had carved out a niche for itself in business  thanks to the industry s first killer app  visicalc  released in       however the apple ii would quickly be displaced for office use by ibm pc compatibles running lotus          apple computer s      release of the apple macintosh introduced the modern gui to the market  which ibm compatible computers would eventually adopt    throughout the     s  pcs became popular with businesses  leading  by the end of the decade  to sub       ibm pc xt class white box machines  usually built in asia and sold by us companies like pcs limited     although the apple ii and atari computers are functionally similar  atari s home oriented marketing resulted in a game heavy library with much fewer business software    in      wayne green  the publisher of kilobaud microcomputing  recommended that companies avoid the term  home computer  in their advertising as  i feel is self limiting for sales     i prefer the term  microcomputers  since it doesn t limit the uses of the equipment in the imagination of the prospective customers        by the mid     s many mass merchants sold video game consoles like the nintendo entertainment system  but no longer sold home computers    most computer companies even those with a majority of sales to home users avoided the term  home computer  because of its association with the image of  as compute  wrote   a low powered  low end machine primarily suited for playing games   apple described the iic as  a serious computer for the serious home user  despite competing against ibm s pcjr home computer  and john sculley denied that his company sold home computers  rather  he said  apple sold  computers for use in the home       in      the company reportedly refused to support joysticks on its low cost macintosh lc and iisi computers to prevent customers from considering them as  game machine s    price wars drove the consumer electronics companies from the market  as they could no longer sustain development of what had become  for them  money losing projects     clones also became popular with non corporate customers  inexpensive  highly compatible clones succeeded where the pcjr had failed  replacing the hobbyists who had made up the majority of the home computer market were  as compute  described them   people who want to take work home from the office now and then  play a game now and then  learn more about computers  and help educate their children   by      industry experts predicted an  ms dos christmas   and the magazine stated that clones threatened commodore  atari  and apple s domination of the home computer market       the declining cost of ibm compatibles on the one hand  and the greatly increased graphics  sound  and storage abilities of fourth generation video game consoles such as the sega genesis and super nintendo entertainment system on the other  combined to cause the market segment for home computers to vanish by the early     s in the us  in europe  the home computer remained a distinct presence for a few years more  with the low end models of the amiga and atari st families being the dominant players  but by the mid     s even the european market had dwindled    the dutch government even ran a program that allowed businesses to sell computers tax free to its employees  often accompanied by home training programs  naturally  these businesses chose to equip their employees with the same systems they themselves were using  today a computer bought for home use anywhere will be very similar to those used in officesxa   made by the same manufacturers  with compatible peripherals  operating systems  and application software     many home computers were superficially similar  most had a keyboard integrated into the same case as the motherboard  sometimes a cheap membrane or chiclet keyboard in the early days  although full travel keyboards quickly became universal due to overwhelming consumer preference  most systems could use an rf modulator to display       column text output on a home television  indeed  the use of a television set as a display almost defines the pre pc home computer  although dedicated composite or  green screen  computer displays were available for this market segment and offered a sharper display  a monitor was often a later purchase made only after users had bought a floppy disk drive  printer  modem  and the other pieces of a full system     this  peripherals sold separately  approach is another defining characteristic of the home computer era  many first time computer buyers brought a base c    system home and hooked it up to their tv only to find they needed to buy a disk drive  the commodore      was the only fully compatible model  or datasette before they could make use of it as anything but a game machine     in the early part of the     s  the dominant microprocessors used in home computers were the   bit mos technology       apple  commodore  atari  and zilog z    trs      one exception was the ti    series  announced in      with a    bit tms     cpu       processor clock rates were typically    xa mhz for      based cpu s and    xa mhz for z   based systems  yielding roughly equal performance   but this aspect was not emphasized by users or manufacturers  as the systems  limited ram capacity  graphics abilities and storage options had a more perceivable effect on performance than cpu speed  clock rate was considered a technical detail of interest only to users needing accurate timing for their own programs  to economize on component cost  often the same crystal used to produce color television compatible signals was also divided down and used for the processor clock  this meant processors rarely operated at their full rated speed  and had the side effect that european and north american versions of the same home computer operated at slightly different speeds and different video resolution due to different television standards     initially  many home computers used the then ubiquitous compact audio cassette as a storage mechanism  a rough analogy to how this worked would be to place a recorder on the phone line as a file was uploaded by modem to  save  it  and playing the recording back through the modem to  load     most cassette implementations were notoriously slow and unreliable  but early       form factor drives were priced for business use  out of reach of most home buyers       eventually mass production of       drives resulted in lower prices  and after about      cassette drives were phased out of the us home computer market        floppy disk drives would remain standard until the end of the   bit era  though external      drives were made available for home computer systems toward the latter part of the     s  almost all software sold for   bit home computers remained on       disks       drives were used for data storage  standardization of disk formats was not common  sometimes even different models from the same manufacturer used different disk formats  toward the end of the home computer era  drives for a number of home computer models appeared offering disk format compatibility with the ibm pc  the disk drives sold with the commodore      amiga and atari st were all able to read and write pc disks  which themselves were undergoing the transition from       to      format at the time  hard drives were never popular on home computers  remaining an expensive  niche product mainly for bbs sysops and the few business users     various copy protection schemes were developed for floppy disks  most were broken in short order  many users would only tolerate copy protection for games  as wear and tear on disks was a significant issue in an entirely floppy based system  the ability to make a  working backup  disk of vital application software was seen as important  copy programs that advertised their ability to copy or even remove common protection schemes were a common category of utility software in this pre dmca era     in another defining characteristic of the home computer  instead of a command line  the basic interpreter served double duty as a user interface  coupled to a character based screen or line editor  basic s file management commands could be entered in direct mode  in contrast to modern computers  home computers most often had their operating system  os  stored in rom chips  this made startup times very fastxa   no more than a few secondsxa   but made os upgrades difficult or impossible without buying a new unit  usually only the most severe bugs were fixed by issuing new roms to replace the old ones at the user s cost     although modern operating systems include extensive programming libraries to ease development and promote standardization  home computer operating systems provided little support to application programs  however  professionally written software often switched out the rom based os anyway to free the address space it occupied and maximize ram capacity  this gave the program full control of the hardware and allowed the programmer to optimize performance for a specific task  as multitasking was never common on home computers  this practice went largely unnoticed by users  most software even lacked an exit command  requiring a reboot to use the system for something else     in an enduring reflection of their early cassette oriented nature  most home computers loaded their disk operating system  dos  separately from the main os  the dos was only used for disk and file related commands and was not required to perform other computing functions  one exception was commodore dos  which was not loaded into the computer s main memory at all   commodore disk drives contained a      processor and ran dos from internal rom     many home computers had a cartridge interface which accepted rom based software  this was also used for expansion or upgrades such as fast loaders  application software on cartridge did exist  which loaded instantly and eliminated the need for disk swapping on single drive setups  but the vast majority of cartridges were games       from about       the high end of the home computer market began to be dominated by  next generation  home computers using the    bit motorola       chip  which enabled the greatly increased abilities of the amiga and atari st series  graphics resolutions approximately doubled to give roughly ntsc class resolution  and color palettes increased from dozens to hundreds or thousands of colors available  stereo sound became standard for the first time  clock rates on the       based systems were approximately  xa mhz with ram capacities of     kb  for the base amiga         up to      kb    megabyte  a milestone  first seen on the atari     st   these systems used      floppy disks from the beginning but       drives were made available to facilitate data exchange with ibm pc compatibles  the amiga and st both had guis inspired by the apple macintosh  but at a list price of        over       in      dollars   the macintosh itself was too expensive for most households     after the first wave of game consoles and computers landed in american homes  the united states federal communications commission  fcc  began receiving complaints of electromagnetic interference to television reception  by      the fcc demanded that home computer makers submit samples for radio frequency interference testing  it was found that  first generation  home computers emitted too much radio frequency noise for household use  the atari     and     were designed with heavy rf shielding to meet the new requirements  between      and      regulations governing rf emittance from home computers were phased in    some companies appealed to the fcc to waive the requirements for home computers  while others  with compliant designs  objected to the waiver  eventually techniques to suppress interference became standardized       in the late     s and early     s  from about      to       it was widely predicted    that computers would soon revolutionize many aspects of home and family life as they had business practices in the previous decades    mothers would keep their recipe catalog in  kitchen computer  databases and turn to a medical database for help with child care  fathers would use the family s computer to manage family finances and track automobile maintenance  children would use online encyclopedias   for school work and would be avid video gamers  the computer would even be tasked with babysitting younger children    home automation would bring about the intelligent home of the    s  using videotex  naplps or some sort of vaguely conceptualized computer technology  television would gain interactivity  it would be possible to do the week s grocery shopping through the television    the  personalized newspaper   to be displayed on the television screen  was another commonly predicted application    morning coffee would be brewed automatically under computer control      the same household computer would control the home s lighting and temperature  robots would take the garbage out  and be programmed to perform new tasks via the home computer  electronics were expensive  so it was generally assumed that each home would have only one computer for the entire family to use    home control would be performed in a multitasking time sharing arrangement  with interfaces to the various devices it was expected to control      tandy executive steve leininger  july          commodore magazine  september         all this was predicted to be commonplace by the end of the     s  but by      dan gutman wrote that the predicted revolution was  in shambles   with only     of american homes owning a computer    virtually every aspect that was foreseen would be delayed to later years or would be entirely surpassed by later technological developments  the home computers of the early     s could not multitask    even if they could  other technical limitations predominated  memory capacities were too small to hold entire encyclopedias or databases of financial records    floppy disk based storage was inadequate in both capacity and speed for multimedia work    and the home computers  graphics chips could only display blocky  unrealistic images and blurry  jagged text that would be difficult to read a newspaper from    although cd rom technology was introduced in      with much promise for its future use  the drives were prohibitively expensive and only interfaced with ibm pcs and compatibles           gutman wrote that when the first computer boom ended in        suddenly  everybody was saying that the home computer was a fad  just another hula hoop     robert lydon  publisher of personal computing  stated in      that the home market  never really existed  it was a fad  just about everyone who was going to buy a computer for their home has done it   and predicted that apple would cease to exist within two years       a backlash set in  computer users were  geeks    nerds  or worse   hackers   the north american video game crash of      soured many on home computer technology as users saw large investments in  the technology of the future  turn into dead ends when manufacturers pulled out of the market or went out of business  the computers that were bought for use in the family room were either forgotten in closets or relegated to basements and children s bedrooms to be used exclusively for games and the occasional book report  home computers of the     s have been called  a technology in search of a use     in      tandy executive steve leininger  designer of the trs    model i  admitted that  as an industry we haven t found any compelling reason to buy a computer for the home  other than for word processing    a      study found that  during a typical week      of adult computer owners did not use their computers at all  usage rates among children were higher  with households reporting that only        of children aged      did not use the computer during a typical week    in       referring to computers used in home automation at the dawn of the home computer era  digital equipment corporation ceo ken olsen is quoted as saying  there is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home        it would take another    years for technology to mature  for the graphical user interface to make the computer approachable for non technical users  and for the world wide web to provide a compelling reason for most people to want a computer in their homes  separate      studies found that     of americans with internet access accessed primarily from home and that not having internet access at home inhibited internet use    predicted aspects of the revolution were left by the wayside or modified in the face of an emerging reality  the cost of electronics dropped precipitously and today many families have a computer for each family member  or a laptop for mom s active lifestyle  a desktop for dad with the kids sharing a computer  encyclopedias  recipe catalogs and medical databases are kept online and accessed over the world wide webxa   not stored locally on floppy disks or cd rom  tv has yet to gain substantial interactivity  instead  the web has evolved alongside television  giving rise to the second screen concept  the htpc and services like netflix  google tv or apple tv along with internet video sites such as youtube and hulu may one day replace traditional broadcast and cable television    our coffee may be brewed automatically every morning  but the computer is a simple one embedded in the coffee maker  not under external control  as of       robots are just beginning to make an impact in the home  with roomba and aibo leading the charge     this delay wasn t out of keeping with other technologies newly introduced to an unprepared public  early motorists were widely derided with the cry of  get a horse     until the automobile was accepted  television languished in research labs for decades before regular public broadcasts began  in an example of changing applications for technology  before the invention of radio  the telephone was used to distribute opera and news reports  whose subscribers were denounced as  illiterate  blind  bedridden and incurably lazy people     likewise  the acceptance of computers into daily life today is a product of continuing refinement of both technology and perception     retrocomputing is the use of vintage hardware  possibly performing modern tasks such as surfing the web and email  as programming techniques evolved and these systems were well understood after decades of use  it became possible to write software giving home computers capabilities undreamed of by their designers  the contiki os implements a gui and tcp ip stack on the apple ii  commodore   bit and atari st platforms  allowing these home computers to function as both internet clients and servers       the commodore    has been repackaged as the c one and c   direct to tv  both designed by jeri ellsworth with modern enhancements       throughout the     s and  st decade of the   st century  many home computer systems were available inexpensively at garage sales and on ebay  many enthusiasts started to collect home computers  with older and rarer systems being much sought after  sometimes the collections turned into a virtual museum presented on web sites       as older hardware ages and the supply of replacement parts dwindles  it has become popular among enthusiasts   to emulate these machines  recreating their software environments   on modern computers  one of the more well known emulators is the multi emulator super system  mess  which can emulate most of the better known home computers  a more or less complete list of home computer emulators can be found in the list of computer system emulators article  games for many   and    bit home computers are becoming available for the wii virtual console     the time line below describes many of the most popular or significant home computers of the late     s and of the     s     the most popular home computers in the usa up to      were  the trs            various models of the apple ii family  first introduced in        the atari                along with its follow up models the    xl and    xe  and the commodore vic           and the commodore            the vic was the first computer of any type to sell over one million units  and the    is still the highest selling single model of personal computer ever  with over    million produced before production stopped in     xa   a    year run with only minor changes    at one point in      commodore was selling as many   s as the rest of the industry s computers combined       the british market was different  as relatively high prices and lower disposable incomes reduced the appeal of most american products  new scientist stated in      that  the price of an american kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of britain     the commodore    was also popular  but a byte columnist stated in            it s not easy for a u k  citizen to write about home computers for an american magazine  we use the term to refer to an altogether different object on our side of the atlantic     in the u s a   an apple ii is a home computer  the ibm pc in its smaller configurations is a home computer  the macintosh is a home computer  home computers use floppy disks for mass storage and perform useful functions like word processing and income tax preparation as well as playing games     in the u k   those computers would be considered rather expensive as business computers  let alone for home use  home computers typically cost less than       about       and use cassette tape recorders for mass storage  we have various manufacturers of our own  some unheard of in the u s a      even when we do have machines in common  the commodore      i suspect that the vast majority of u s  users buy the disk drive  while the majority of u k  users have only the cassette deck     many of the british made systems like sinclair s zx   and spectrum  and later the amstrad schneider cpc were much cheaper in europe than us systems  the reverse was also true  as popular british systems like the spectrum never became popular in the us  a few british sinclair models were sold for low prices in the us by timex corporation  such as the timex sinclair      and the ill fated timex sinclair       but never established a strong following  the result was that these british systems were much more popular in europe than in the usa  the only notable exception being the commodore     which competed favorably price wise with the british systems  and was the most popular system in europe as in the usa         until the introduction of the ibm pc in       computers such as the apple ii and trs    also found considerable use in office work      in      ibm introduced the pcjr in an attempt to continue their business computer success in the home computer market  but incompatibilities between it and the standard pc kept users away      the commodore pet had a sizable presence in the north american education market until that segment was largely ceded to the apple ii as commodore focused on the c    s success in the mass retail market       three microcomputers were the prototypes for what would later become the home computer market segment  but when introduced they sold as much to hobbyists and small businesses as to the home     the following computers also introduced significant advancements to the home computer segment
