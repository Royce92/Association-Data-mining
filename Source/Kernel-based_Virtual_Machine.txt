 kvm  kernel based virtual machine  is a virtualization infrastructure for the linux kernel that turns it into a hypervisor  which was merged into the linux kernel mainline in february        kvm requires a processor with hardware virtualization extension   kvm has also been ported to freebsd  and illumos  in the form of loadable kernel modules     kvm originally supported x   processors and has been ported to s       powerpc   and ia     an arm port was merged during the     kernel merge window      a wide variety of guest operating systems work with kvm  including many flavours and versions of linux  bsd  solaris  windows  haiku  reactos  plan    aros research operating system  and os x   in addition  android      gnu hurd    debian k     minix      a  solaris    u  and darwin        together with other operating systems and some newer versions of these listed  are known to work with certain limitations       paravirtualization support for certain devices is available for linux  openbsd    freebsd    netbsd    plan     and windows guests using the virtio   api  this supports a paravirtual ethernet card  a paravirtual disk i o controller    a balloon device for adjusting guest memory usage  and a vga graphics interface using spice or vmware drivers             by itself  kvm does not perform any emulation  instead  it simply exposes the  dev kvm interface  with which a userspace host can then     on linux  qemu versions        and later is one such userspace host  qemu will use kvm when available to virtualize guests at near native speeds  but otherwise will fall back to software only emulation     internally  kvm uses seabios as an open source implementation of a    bit x   bios       kvm s parts are licensed under various gnu licenses       avi kivity began the development of kvm at qumranet  which was a technology startup company   bought by red hat later in            kvm was merged into the linux kernel mainline in kernel version         released on   february           kvm is maintained by paolo bonzini and gleb natapov
