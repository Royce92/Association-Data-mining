 software as a service  saas  pronounced  s s  or  s  s    is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted    it is sometimes referred to as  on demand software    saas is typically accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser  saas has become a common delivery model for many business applications  including office and messaging software  payroll processing software  dbms software  management software  cad software  development software  gamification  virtualization   accounting  collaboration  customer relationship management  crm   management information systems  mis   enterprise resource planning  erp   invoicing  human resource management  hrm   content management  cm  and service desk management   saas has been incorporated into the strategy of all leading enterprise software companies  one of the biggest selling points for these companies is the potential to reduce it support costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the saas provider citation needed    according to a gartner group estimate  saas sales in      reached     billion  and were projected to increase to      bn in       up       from        gartner group estimates that saas revenue will be more than double its      numbers by      and reach a projected      bn  customer relationship management  crm  continues to be the largest market for saas  saas revenue within the crm market was forecast to reach     bn in       up from     bn in           the term  software as a service   saas  is considered to be part of the nomenclature of cloud computing  along with infrastructure as a service  iaas   platform as a service  paas   desktop as a service  daas   backend as a service  baas   and information technology management as a service  itmaas               centralized hosting of business applications dates back to the     s  starting in that decade  ibm and other mainframe providers conducted a service bureau business  often referred to as time sharing or utility computing  such services included offering computing power and database storage to banks and other large organizations from their worldwide data centers citation needed    the expansion of the internet during the     s brought about a new class of centralized computing  called application service providers  asp   asps provided businesses with the service of hosting and managing specialized business applications  with the goal of reducing costs through central administration and through the solution provider s specialization in a particular business application  two of the world s pioneers and largest asps were usi  which was headquartered in the washington  d c  area  and futurelink corporation  headquartered in orange county  california citation needed    software as a service essentially extends the idea of the asp model  the term software as a service  saas   however  is commonly used in more specific settings     the acronym allegedly first appeared in an article called  strategic backgrounder  software as a service   internally published in february      by the software   information industry association s  siia  ebusiness division      dbaas  database as a service  has emerged as a sub variety of saas       the cloud  or saas  model has no physical need for indirect distribution since it is not distributed physically and is deployed almost instantaneously  the first wave of saas companies built their own economic model without including partner remuneration in their pricing structure  except when there were certain existing affiliations   it has not been easy for traditional software publishers to enter into the saas model  firstly  because the saas model does not bring them the same income structure  secondly  because continuing to work with a distribution network was decreasing their profit margins and was damaging to the competitiveness of their product pricing  today a landscape is taking shape with saas and managed service players who combine the indirect sales model with their own existing business model  and those who seek to redefine their role within the     it economy       unlike traditional software which is conventionally sold as a perpetual license with an up front cost  and an optional ongoing support fee   saas providers generally price applications using a subscription fee  most commonly a monthly fee or an annual fee    consequently  the initial setup cost for saas is typically lower than the equivalent enterprise software  saas vendors typically price their applications based on some usage parameters  such as the number of users using the application  however  because in a saas environment customers  data reside with the saas vendor  opportunities also exist to charge per transaction  event  or other unit of value  such as the number of processors required       the relatively low cost for user provisioning  i e   setting up a new customer  in a multi tenant environment enables some saas vendors to offer applications using the freemium model    in this model  a free service is made available with limited functionality or scope  and fees are charged for enhanced functionality or larger scope    some other saas applications are completely free to users  with revenue being derived from alternate sources such as advertising citation needed    a key driver of saas growth is saas vendors  ability to provide a price that is competitive with on premises software  this is consistent with the traditional rationale for outsourcing it systems  which involves applying economies of scale to application operation  i e   an outside service provider may be able to offer better  cheaper  more reliable applications citation needed    the vast majority of saas solutions are based on a multi tenant architecture  with this model  a single version of the application  with a single configuration  hardware  network  operating system   is used for all customers   tenants    to support scalability  the application is installed on multiple machines  called horizontal scaling   in some cases  a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre release versions of the applications  e g   a beta version  for testing purposes  this is contrasted with traditional software  where multiple physical copies of the software   each potentially of a different version  with a potentially different configuration  and often customized   are installed across various customer sites     while an exception rather than the norm  some saas solutions do not use multi tenancy  or use other mechanisms such as virtualization to cost effectively manage a large number of customers in place of multi tenancy    whether multi tenancy is a necessary component for software as a service is a topic of controversy       while not all software as a service applications share all traits  the characteristics below are common among many saas applications     saas applications similarly support what is traditionally known as application customization  in other words  like traditional enterprise software  a single customer can alter the set of configuration options  a k a   parameters  that affect its functionality and look and feel  each customer may have its own settings  or  parameter values  for the configuration options  the application can be customized to the degree it was designed for based on a set of predefined configuration options     for example  to support customers  common need to change an application s look and feel so that the application appears to be having the customer s brand  or if so desired co branded   many saas applications let customers provide  through a self service interface or by working with application provider staff  a custom logo and sometimes a set of custom colors  the customer cannot  however  change the page layout unless such an option was designed for     saas applications are often updated more frequently than traditional software    in many cases on a weekly or monthly basis  this is enabled by several factors     accelerated feature delivery is further enabled by agile software development methodologies    such methodologies  which have evolved in the mid     s  provide a set of software development tools and practices to support frequent software releases     since saas applications cannot access a company s internal systems  databases or internal services   they predominantly offer integration protocols and application programming interfaces  apis  that operate over a wide area network  typically  these are protocols based on http  rest  soap and json     the ubiquity of saas applications and other internet services and the standardization of their api technology has spawned development of mashups  which are lightweight applications that combine data  presentation and functionality from multiple services  creating a compound service  mashups further differentiate saas applications from on premises software as the latter cannot be easily integrated outside a company s firewall     inspired by the success of online social networks and other so called web     functionality  many saas applications offer features that let its users collaborate and share information     for example  many project management applications delivered in the saas model offer in addition to traditional project planning functionality collaboration features letting users comment on tasks and plans and share documents within and outside an organization  several other saas applications let users vote on and offer new feature ideas     while some collaboration related functionality is also integrated into on premises software   implicit or explicit  collaboration between users or different customers is only possible with centrally hosted software     several important changes to the software market and technology landscape have facilitated acceptance and growth of saas solutions     some limitations slow down the acceptance of saas and prohibit it from being used in some cases     the standard model also has limitations     as a result of widespread fragmentation in the saas provider space    there is an emerging trend towards the development of saas integration platforms  sip     these sips allow subscribers to access multiple saas applications through a common platform  they also offer new application developers an opportunity to quickly develop and deploy new applications  this trend is being referred to as the  third wave  in software adoption   where saas moves beyond standalone applications to become a comprehensive platform  zoho and sutisoft are two companies that offer comprehensive sips today  several other industry players  including salesforce  microsoft  and oracle are aggressively developing similar integration platforms  another trend deals with the rise of software products that combine functions for human resource management  payroll accounting  and expense management as an all in one solution in promoting collaboration between an employer and an employee  this supplements the ongoing effort of many businesses to create employee self service tools for their workforce     software as a service data escrow is the process of keeping a copy of critical software as a service application data with an independent third party  similar to source code escrow  where critical software source code is stored with an independent third party  saas data escrow is the same logic applied to the data within a saas application  it allows companies to protect and insure all the data that resides within saas applications  protecting against data loss       there are many and varied reasons for considering saas data escrow including concerns about vendor bankruptcy   unplanned service outages and potential data loss or corruption  many businesses are also keen to ensure that they are complying with their own data governance standards or want improved reporting and business analytics against their saas data  a research conducted by clearpace software ltd  into the growth of saas showed that    percent of the participants wanted to take a copy of their saas data  a third of these participants wanted a copy on a daily basis       one notable criticism of saas comes from richard stallman of the free software foundation referring to it as service as a software substitute  saass     he considers the use of saass to be a violation of the principles of free software    according to stallman     with saass  the users do not have a copy of the executable file  it is on the server  where the users can t see or touch it  thus it is impossible for them to ascertain what it really does  and impossible to change it  saas inherently gives the server operator the power to change the software in use  or the users  data being operated on     this criticism does not apply to all saas products  in       forbes contributor dan woods noted that drupal gardens  a free web hosting platform based on the open source drupal content management system  is a  new open source model for saas   he added   open source provides the escape hatch  in drupal gardens  users will be able to press a button and get a source code version of the drupal code that runs their site along with the data from the database  then  you can take that code  put it up at one of the hosting companies  and you can do anything that you would like to do        andrew hoppin  a former chief information officer for the new york state senate  refers to this combination of saas and open source software as opensaas and points to wordpress as another successful example of an opensaas software delivery model that gives customers  the best of both worlds  and more options  the fact that it is open source means that they can start building their websites by self hosting wordpress and customizing their website to their heart s content  concurrently  the fact that wordpress is saas means that they don t have to manage the website at all    they can simply pay wordpress com to host it
