 hydraulics is a topic in applied science and engineering dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids  at a very basic level  hydraulics is the liquid version of pneumatics  fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics  which focuses on the engineering uses of fluid properties  in fluid power  hydraulics is used for the generation  control  and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids  hydraulic topics range through some part of science and most of engineering modules  and cover concepts such as pipe flow  dam design  fluidics and fluid control circuitry  pumps  turbines  hydropower  computational fluid dynamics  flow measurement  river channel behavior and erosion     free surface hydraulics is the branch of hydraulics dealing with free surface flow  such as occurring in rivers  canals  lakes  estuaries and seas  its sub field open channel flow studies the flow in open channels     the word  hydraulics  originates from the greek word             hydraulikos  which in turn originates from       hydor  greek for water  and        aulos  meaning pipe              early uses of water power date back to mesopotamia and ancient egypt  where irrigation has been used since the  th millennium bc and water clocks had been used since the early  nd millennium bc  other early examples of water power include the qanat system in ancient persia and the turpan water system in ancient china     the greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems  an example is the construction by eupalinos  under a public contract  of a watering channel for samos  the tunnel of eupalinos  an early example of the usage of hydraulic wheel  probably the earliest in europe  is the perachora wheel   rd century bc       notable is the construction of the first hydraulic automata by ctesibius  flourished c      bc  and hero of alexandria  c          ad   hero describes a number of working machines using hydraulic power  such as the force pump  which is known from many roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines     in ancient china there was sunshu ao   th century bc   ximen bao   th century bc   du shi  circa    ad   zhang heng           ad   and ma jun            ad   while medieval china had su song              ad  and shen kuo              du shi employed a waterwheel to power the bellows of a blast furnace producing cast iron  zhang heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an armillary sphere for astronomical observation     in ancient sri lanka  hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of anuradhapura and polonnaruwa   the discovery of the principle of the valve tower  or valve pit   bisokotuwa in sinhalese  for regulating the escape of water is credited to ingenuity more than       years ago   by the first century ad  several large scale irrigation works had been completed   macro  and micro hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural needs  surface drainage and erosion control  ornamental and recreational water courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in sigiriya  sri lanka  the coral on the massive rock at the site includes cisterns for collecting water  large ancient reservoirs of sri lanka are kalawewa  king dhatusena   parakrama samudra  king parakrama bahu   tisa wewa  king dutugamunu   minneriya  king mahasen     in ancient rome  many different hydraulic applications were developed  including public water supplies  innumerable aqueducts  power using watermills and hydraulic mining  they were among the first to make use of the siphon to carry water across valleys  and used hushing on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal ores  they used lead widely in plumbing systems for domestic and public supply  such as feeding thermae     hydraulic mining was used in the gold fields of northern spain  which was conquered by augustus in    bc  the alluvial gold mine of las medulas was one of the largest of their mines  it was worked by at least   long aqueducts  and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits  and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content     in      benedetto castelli                     a student of galileo galilei  published the book della misura dell acque correnti or  on the measurement of running waters   one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics  he served as a chief consultant to the pope on hydraulic projects  i e   management of rivers in the papal states  beginning in           blaise pascal             studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics  centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids  his inventions include the hydraulic press  which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area  transmitted through the same pressure  or same change of pressure  at both locations  pascal s law or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest  the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force  this implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid  there is an equal increase at every other point in the container  i e   any change in pressure applied at any point of the fluid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids     a french physician  poiseuille researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred citation needed    several cities developed city wide hydraulic power networks in the   th century  to operate machinery such as lifts  cranes  capstans and the like  joseph bramah  was an early innovator and william armstrong  perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial scale  in london  the london hydraulic power company  was a major supplier its pipes serving large parts of the west end of london  city and the docks  but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and railway goods yards
