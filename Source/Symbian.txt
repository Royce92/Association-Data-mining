 symbian was a closed source  mobile operating system  os  and computing platform designed for smartphones   symbian was originally developed by symbian ltd    as a descendant of psion s epoc and runs exclusively on arm processors  although an unreleased x   port existed  the current form of symbian is an open source platform developed by symbian foundation in       as the successor of the original symbian os  symbian was used by many major mobile phone brands  like samsung  motorola  sony ericsson  and above all by nokia  it was the most popular smartphone os on a worldwide average until the end of       when it was overtaken by android     symbian rose to fame from its use with the s   platform built by nokia  first released in      and powering most nokia smartphones  uiq  another symbian platform  ran in parallel  but these two platforms were not compatible with each other  symbian^   was officially released in q       as the successor of s   and uiq  first used in the nokia n   to use a single platform for the os  in may      an update  symbian anna  was officially announced  followed by nokia belle  previously symbian belle  in august            on    february       nokia announced that it would use microsoft s windows phone os as its primary smartphone platform  whilst symbian would be gradually wound down      on    june      nokia signed an agreement for accenture to provide symbian based software development and support services to nokia through       about       nokia employees became accenture employees as of october         the transfer was completed on    september        the nokia     pureview is officially the last symbian smartphone    in january      nokia stopped accepting new or changed symbian software from developers  effectively terminating its support of the operating system               symbian originated from epoc  an operating system created by psion in the     s  in june       psion software became symbian ltd   a major joint venture between psion and phone manufacturers ericsson  motorola  and nokia     afterwards  different software platforms were created for symbian  backed by different groups of mobile phone manufacturers  they include s    nokia  samsung and lg   uiq  sony ericsson and motorola  and moap s   japanese only such as fujitsu  sharp etc       in june       nokia announced the acquisition of symbian ltd   and a new independent non profit organization called the symbian foundation was established  symbian os and its associated user interfaces s    uiq and moap s  were contributed by their owners nokia  ntt docomo  sony ericsson and symbian ltd   to the foundation with the objective of creating the symbian platform as a royalty free  open source software  under the osi  and fsf approved eclipse public license  epl   the platform has been designated as the successor to symbian os  following the official launch of the symbian foundation in april       the symbian platform was officially made available as open source code in february            nokia became the major contributor to symbian s code  since it then possessed the development resources for both the symbian os core and the user interface  since then nokia has been maintaining its own code repository for the platform development  regularly releasing its development to the public repository    symbian was intended to be developed by a community led by the symbian foundation  which was first announced in june      and which officially launched in april       its objective was to publish the source code for the entire symbian platform under the osi  and fsf approved eclipse public license  epl   the code was published under epl on   february       symbian foundation reported this event to be the largest codebase moved to open source in history         however  some important components within symbian os were licensed from third parties  which prevented the foundation from publishing the full source under epl immediately  instead much of the source was published under a more restrictive symbian foundation license  sfl  and access to the full source code was limited to member companies only  although membership was open to any organisation       in november       the symbian foundation announced that due to changes in global economic and market conditions  and also a lack of support from members such as samsung   and sony ericsson   it would transition to a licensing only organisation    nokia announced it would take over the stewardship of the symbian platform  symbian foundation will remain the trademark holder and licensing entity and will only have non executive directors involved     on    february       nokia announced a partnership with microsoft that would see it adopt windows phone as its primary smartphone platform    and symbian will be its franchise platform  dropping symbian as its main smartphone os of choice     as a consequence  the use of the symbian platform for building mobile applications dropped rapidly  research in june      indicated that over     of mobile developers using symbian at the time of publication were planning to abandon the platform       by   april       nokia ceased to openly source any portion of the symbian software and reduced its collaboration to a small group of pre selected partners in japan   source code released under the epl remains available in third party repositories         on    june       nokia made an agreement with accenture for an outsourcing program  accenture will provide symbian based software development and support services to nokia through       about       nokia employees became accenture employees as of october         the transfer was completed on    september           nokia terminated its support of software development and maintenance for symbian with effect from   january       thereafter refusing to publish new or changed symbian applications or content in the nokia store and terminating its  symbian signed  program for software certification        symbian has had a native graphics toolkit since its inception  known as avkon  formerly known as series      s   was designed to be manipulated by a keyboard like interface metaphor  such as the     key augmented telephone keypad  or the mini qwerty keyboards  avkon based software is binary compatible with symbian versions up to and including symbian^      symbian^  includes the qt framework  which is now the recommended user interface toolkit for new applications  qt can also be installed on older symbian devices     symbian^  was planned to introduce a new gui library framework specifically designed for a touch based interface  known as  ui extensions for mobile  or uiemo  internal project name  orbit    which was built on top of qt widget  a preview was released in january       however in october      nokia announced that orbit uiemo had been cancelled     nokia currently recommends that developers use qt quick with qml  the new high level declarative ui and scripting framework for creating visually rich touchscreen interfaces that allows development for both symbian and meego  it will be delivered to existing symbian^  devices as a qt update  when more applications gradually feature a user interface reworked in qt  the legacy s   framework  avkon  will be deprecated and no longer included with new devices at some point  thus breaking binary compatibility with older s   applications         symbian^  and earlier have a built in webkit based browser  symbian was the first mobile platform to make use of webkit  in june          some older symbian models have opera mobile as their default browser     nokia released a new browser with the release of symbian anna with improved speed and an improved user interface       symbian has strong localization support enabling manufacturers and  rd party application developers to localize their symbian based products in order to support global distribution  current symbian release  symbian belle  has support for    languages  which nokia makes available on device in language packs  set of languages which cover the languages commonly spoken in the area where the device variant is intended to be sold   all language packs have in common english  or a locally relevant dialect of it   the supported languages with dialects  and scripts  in symbian belle are     symbian belle marks the introduction of kazakh  while korean is no longer supported     from       symbian switched to using standard c   with qt as the main sdk  which can be used with either qt creator or carbide c    qt supports the older symbian s    rd  starting with feature pack    aka s        and symbian s    th edition  aka s       b  releases  as well as the new symbian platform  it also supports maemo and meego  windows  linux and mac os x         alternative application development can be done using python  see python for s     adobe flash lite or java me     symbian os previously used a symbian specific c   version  along with carbide c   integrated development environment  ide   as the native application development environment     web run time  wrt  is a portable application framework that allows creating widgets on the s   platform  it is an extension to the s   webkit based browser that allows launching multiple browser instances as separate javascript applications         as of       the sdk for symbian is standard c    using qt  it can be used with either qt creator  or carbide  the older ide previously used for symbian development       a phone simulator allows testing of qt apps  apps compiled for the simulator are compiled to native code for the development platform  rather than having to be emulated    application development can either use c   or qml     as symbian os is written in c   using symbian software s coding standards  it is possible to develop using symbian c    although it is not a standard implementation  before the release of the qt sdk  this was the standard development environment  there were multiple platforms based on symbian os that provided software development kit  sdks  for application developers wishing to target symbian os devices  the main ones being uiq and s    individual phone products  or families  often had sdks or sdk extensions downloadable from the maker s website too     the sdks contain documentation  the header files and library files needed to build symbian os software  and a windows based emulator   wins    up until symbian os version    the sdks also included a version of the gnu compiler collection  gcc  compiler  a cross compiler  needed to build software to work on the device     symbian os   and the symbian platform use a new application binary interface  abi  and needed a different compiler  a choice of compilers is available including a newer version of gcc  see external links below      unfortunately  symbian c   programming has a steep learning curve  as symbian c   requires the use of special techniques such as descriptors  active objects and the cleanup stack  this can make even relatively simple programs initially harder to implement than in other environments  it is possible that the techniques  developed for the much more restricted mobile hardware and compilers of the     s  caused extra complexity in source code because programmers are required to concentrate on low level details instead of more application specific features  as of       these issues are no longer the case when using standard c    with the qt sdk     symbian c   programming is commonly done with an integrated development environment  ide   for earlier versions of symbian os  the commercial ide codewarrior for symbian os was favoured  the codewarrior tools were replaced during      by carbide c    an eclipse based ide developed by nokia  carbide c   is offered in four different versions  express  developer  professional  and oem  with increasing levels of capability  fully featured software can be created and released with the express edition  which is free  features such as ui design  crash debugging etc  are available in the other  charged for  editions  microsoft visual studio      and      are also supported via the carbide vs plugin     symbian devices can also be programmed using python  java me  flash lite  ruby   net  web runtime  wrt  widgets and standard c c         visual basics programmers can use ns basic to develop apps for s    rd edition and uiq   devices     in the past  visual basic  visual basic  net  and c  development for symbian were possible through appforge crossfire  a plugin for microsoft visual studio  on    march      appforge ceased operations  oracle purchased the intellectual property  but announced that they did not plan to sell or provide support for former appforge products  net    a  net compact framework for symbian  which is developed by redfivelabs  is sold as a commercial product  with net    vb net and c   and other  source code is compiled into an intermediate language  il  which is executed within the symbian os using a just in time compiler   as of         redfivelabs has ceased development of net   with this announcement on their landing page   at this stage we are pursuing some options to sell the ip so that net   may continue to have a future       there is also a version of a borland ide for symbian os  symbian os development is also possible on linux and mac os x using tools and methods developed by the community  partly enabled by symbian releasing the source code for key tools  a plugin that allows development of symbian os applications in apple s xcode ide for mac os x was available       java me applications for symbian os are developed using standard techniques and tools such as the sun java wireless toolkit  formerly the j me wireless toolkit   they are packaged as jar  and possibly jad  files  both cldc and cdc applications can be created with netbeans  other tools include superwaba  which can be used to build symbian     and    s programs using java     nokia s   phones can also run python scripts when the interpreter python for s   is installed  with a custom made api that allows for bluetooth support and such  there is also an interactive console to allow the user to write python scripts directly from the phone     once developed  symbian applications need to find a route to customers  mobile phones  they are packaged in sis files which may be installed over the air  via pc connect  bluetooth or on a memory card  an alternative is to partner with a phone manufacturer and have the software included on the phone itself  applications must be symbian signed for symbian os   x in order to make use of certain capabilities  system capabilities  restricted capabilities and device manufacturer capabilities     applications can now be signed for free       symbian s design is subdivided into technology domains    each of which comprises a number of software packages    each technology domain has its own roadmap  and the symbian foundation has a team of technology managers who manage these technology domain roadmaps     every package is allocated to exactly one technology domain  based on the general functional area to which the package contributes and by which it may be influenced  by grouping related packages by themes  the symbian foundation hopes to encourage a strong community to form around them and to generate discussion and review     the symbian system model   illustrates the scope of each of the technology domains across the platform packages     packages are owned and maintained by a package owner  a named individual from an organization member of the symbian foundation  who accepts code contributions from the wider symbian community and is responsible for package     the symbian kernel  eka   supports sufficiently fast real time response to build a single core phone around it that is  a phone in which a single processor core executes both the user applications and the signalling stack    the real time kernel has a microkernel architecture containing only the minimum  most basic primitives and functionality  for maximum robustness  availability and responsiveness  it has been termed a nanokernel  because it needs an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions  it contains a scheduler  memory management and device drivers  with networking  telephony and file system support services in the os services layer or the base services layer  the inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is not a true microkernel     symbian features pre emptive multitasking and memory protection  like other operating systems  especially those created for use on desktop computers   epoc s approach to multitasking was inspired by vms and is based on asynchronous server based events     symbian os was created with three systems design principles in mind     to best follow these principles  symbian uses a microkernel  has a request and callback approach to services  and maintains separation between user interface and engine  the os is optimised for low power battery based devices and for rom based systems  e g  features like xip and re entrancy in shared libraries   applications  and the os itself  follow an object oriented design  model view controller  mvc      later os iterations diluted this approach in response to market demands  notably with the introduction of a real time kernel and a platform security model in versions   and       there is a strong emphasis on conserving resources which is exemplified by symbian specific programming idioms like descriptors and a cleanup stack  similar methods exist to conserve storage space  further  all symbian programming is event based  and the central processing unit  cpu  is switched into a low power mode when applications are not directly dealing with an event  this is done via a programming idiom called active objects  similarly the symbian approach to threads and processes is driven by reducing overheads     the all over model contains the following layers  from top to bottom     the base services layer is the lowest level reachable by user side operations  it includes the file server and user library  a plug in framework which manages all plug ins  store  central repository  dbms and cryptographic services  it also includes the text window server and the text shell  the two basic services from which a completely functional port can be created without the need for any higher layer services     symbian has a microkernel architecture  which means that the minimum necessary is within the kernel to maximise robustness  availability and responsiveness  it contains a scheduler  memory management and device drivers  but other services like networking  telephony and filesystem support are placed in the os services layer or the base services layer  the inclusion of device drivers means the kernel is not a true microkernel  the eka  real time kernel  which has been termed a nanokernel  contains only the most basic primitives and requires an extended kernel to implement any other abstractions     symbian is designed to emphasise compatibility with other devices  especially removable media file systems  early development of epoc led to adopting fat as the internal file system  and this remains  but an object oriented persistence model was placed over the underlying fat to provide a posix style interface and a streaming model  the internal data formats rely on using the same apis that create the data to run all file manipulations  this has resulted in data dependence and associated difficulties with changes and data migration     there is a large networking and communication subsystem  which has three main servers called  etel  epoc telephony   esock  epoc sockets  and c    responsible for serial communication   each of these has a plug in scheme  for example  esock allows different   prt  protocol modules to implement various networking protocol schemes  the subsystem also contains code that supports short range communication links  such as bluetooth  irda and usb     there is also a large volume of user interface  ui  code  only the base classes and substructure were contained in symbian os  while most of the actual user interfaces were maintained by third parties  this is no longer the case  the three major uis   s    uiq and moap   were contributed to symbian in       symbian also contains graphics  text layout and font rendering libraries     all native symbian c   applications are built up from three framework classes defined by the application architecture  an application class  a document class and an application user interface class  these classes create the fundamental application behaviour  the remaining needed functions  the application view  data model and data interface  are created independently and interact solely through their apis with the other classes     many other things do not yet fit into this model   for example  syncml  java me providing another set of apis on top of most of the os and multimedia  many of these are frameworks  and vendors are expected to supply plug ins to these frameworks from third parties  for example  helix player for multimedia codecs   this has the advantage that the apis to such areas of functionality are the same on many phone models  and that vendors get a lot of flexibility  but it means that phone vendors needed to do a great deal of integration work to make a symbian os phone     symbian includes a reference user interface called  techview   it provides a basis for starting customisation and is the environment in which much symbian test and example code runs  it is very similar to the user interface from the psion series   personal organiser and is not used for any production phone user interface     symbian  as it advanced to os version      began to spun off into several different user interfaces or uis  each back by a certain company or group of companies  unlike android os with its different cosmetic uis  symbian uis are deeper in code modifications and integrations  therefore referred to as ui platforms   things began more complicated when applications developed for different symbian uis platforms are not compatible with each other  and this led to os fragmentation       user interfaces platforms that run on or are based on symbian os include     also called series     it was backed mainly by nokia  there are several editions of this platform  appearing first as s     st edition  on nokia       it was followed by s    nd edition  nokia n    s    rd edition  nokia n    and touch based s    th edition  nokia n     the name  s    was dropped after the formation of symbian foundation and renames itself as symbian^     and       used by nokia communicators such as nokia     i     touch and button based  only phone using this platform is nokia          backed mainly by sony ericsson and then motorola  it is compatible with both buttons and touch stylus based inputs  the last major release version is uiq    in       on sony ericsson g     it was discontinued after the formation of symbian foundation  and the decision to consolidate different symbian ui versions into one led to the adoption of s   as the version going forward       used by fujitsu  mitsubishi  sony ericsson and sharp developed phones for ntt docomo  it uses an interface developed specifically for docomo s foma  freedom of mobile access  network brand and is based on the ui from earlier fujitsu foma models  the user cannot install new c

      of the market in the second quarter of            symbian has lost market share over the years as the market has dramatically grown  with new competing platforms entering the market  though its sales have increased during the same timeframe  e g   although symbian s share of the global smartphone market dropped from       in      to       in       shipments of symbian devices grew       from      million units to      million units    from q       to q        shipments of symbian devices grew        by     million units  from            units to             compared to an increase of     million units for android      million units for rim  and     million units for apple       prior reports on device shipments as published in february      showed that the symbian devices formed a       share of the smart mobile devices shipped in       with rim having        apple having        via ios   microsoft having       via windows ce and windows mobile  and android having            in the number of  smart mobile device  sales  symbian devices were the market leaders for       statistics showed that symbian devices formed a       share of smart mobile devices sold  with android having        rim having      and apple having        via ios     some estimates indicate that the number of mobile devices shipped with the symbian os up to the end of q       is     million       over the course of            motorola  samsung  lg  and sony ericsson announced their withdrawal from symbian in favour of alternative platforms including google s android  microsoft s windows phone             in q       according to idc worldwide market share has dropped to an all time low of            the users of symbian in the countries with non latin alphabets  such as russia  ukraine and others  have been criticizing the complicated method of language switching for many years    for example  if a user wants to type a latin letter  they must call the menu  click the languages item  use arrow keys to choose  for example  the english language from among many other languages  and then press the  ok  button  after typing the latin letter  the user must repeat the procedure to return to his native keyboard  this method slows down typing significantly  in touch phones and qwerty phones the procedure is slightly different but remains time consuming  all other mobile operating systems  as well as nokia s s   phones  enable switching between two initially selected languages by one click or a single gesture     early versions of the firmware for the original nokia n    running on symbian^  series     th edition have been heavily criticized as buggy  also contributed by the low amount of ram installed in the phone        in november       smartphone blog all about symbian criticized the performance of symbian s default web browser and recommended the alternative browser opera mobile    nokia s senior vice president jo harlow promised an updated browser in the first quarter of            there are many different versions and editions of symbian  which led to fragmentation  apps and software may be incompatible when installed across different versions of symbian       symbian os is subject to a variety of viruses  the best known of which is cabir  usually these send themselves from phone to phone by bluetooth  so far  none have taken advantage of any flaws in symbian os   instead  they have all asked the user whether they would like to install the software  with somewhat prominent warnings that it can t be trusted  although some rely on social engineering  often in the form of messages that come with the malware  purporting to be a utility  game or some other application for symbian     however  with a view that the average mobile phone user shouldn t have to worry about security  symbian os   x adopted a unix style capability model  permissions per process  not per object   installed software is theoretically unable to do damaging things  such as costing the user money by sending network data  without being digitally signed   thus making it traceable  commercial developers who can afford the cost can apply to have their software signed via the symbian signed program  developers also have the option of self signing their programs  however  the set of available features does not include access to bluetooth  irda  gsm cellid  voice calls  gps and few others  some operators have opted to disable all certificates other than the symbian signed certificates     some other hostile programs are listed below  but all of them still require the input of the user to run     a new form of malware threat to symbian os in the form of  cooked firmware  was demonstrated at the international malware conference  malcon  december       by indian hacker atul alex         symbian os   x devices can be hacked to remove the platform security introduced in os     onwards  allowing users to execute unsigned code    this allows altering system files  and access to previously locked areas of the os  the hack was criticised by nokia for potentially increasing the threat posed by mobile viruses as unsigned code can be executed       epoc   featured a primarily   bit per pixel  keyboard operated graphical interface     the hardware for which it was designed originally had pointer input in the form of a digitiser panel     in the late     s  the operating system was referred to as epoc   to distinguish it from psion s then new epoc   os     the epoc   operating system  at the time simply referred to as epoc  was later renamed symbian os  adding to the confusion with names  before the change to symbian  epoc   was often referred to as sibo to distinguish it from the  new  epoc  despite the similarity of the names  epoc   and epoc   were completely different operating systems  epoc   being written in c   from a new codebase with development beginning during the mid     s     epoc   was a pre emptive multitasking  single user operating system with memory protection  which encourages the application developer to separate their program into an engine and an interface  the psion line of pdas come with a graphical user interface called eikon which is specifically tailored for handheld machines with a keyboard  thus looking perhaps more similar to desktop guis than palmtop guis     however  one of epoc s characteristics is the ease with which new guis can be developed based on a core set of gui classes  a feature which has been widely explored from ericsson r    and onwards     epoc   was originally developed for the arm family of processors  including the arm   arm   strongarm and intel s xscale  but can be compiled towards target devices using several other processor types     during the development of epoc    psion planned to license epoc to third party device manufacturers  and spin off its software division as psion software  one of the first licensees was the short lived geofox  which halted production with less than       units sold  ericsson marketed a rebranded psion series  mx called the mc     and later created the epoc release     based smartphone  the r     oregon scientific also released a budget epoc device  the osaris  notable as the only epoc device to ship with release        work started on the    bit version in late          the series   device  released in june       used the first iterations of the epoc   os  codenamed  protea   and the  eikon  graphical user interface     the oregon scientific osaris was the only pda to use the er      the psion

achieve a commercial release  this release has been retrospectively dubbed symbian os       the first phone using er u  the ericsson r    was released in november       it was not an  open  phone   software could not be installed  notably  a number of never released psion prototypes for next generation pdas  including a bluetooth revo successor codenamed  conan  were using er u  the  u  in the name refers to the fact that it supported unicode     in june       psion software became symbian ltd   a major joint venture between psion and phone manufacturers ericsson  motorola  and nokia  as of release    epoc became known simply as symbian os     the first  open  symbian os phone  the nokia      communicator  was released in june       bluetooth support was added  almost         symbian phones were shipped in       rising to     million the following year     development of different uis was made generic with a  reference design strategy  for either  smartphone  or  communicator  devices  subdivided further into keyboard  or tablet based designs  two reference uis  dfrds or device family reference designs  were shipped   quartz and crystal  the former was merged with ericsson s  ronneby  design and became the basis for the uiq interface  the latter reached the market as the nokia series    ui     later dfrds were sapphire  ruby  and emerald  only sapphire came to market  evolving into the pearl dfrd and finally the nokia series    ui  a keypad based  square  ui for the first true smartphones  the first one of them was the nokia      smartphone  featuring symbian os       which was also the first with a built in camera  with vga      mpx            resolution  other notable s   symbian     devices are the nokia       the short lived sendo x and siemens sx    the
