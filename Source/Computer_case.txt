 a computer case also known as a computer chassis  tower  system unit  cabinet  base unit or simply case and sometimes incorrectly referred to as the  cpu  or  hard drive     is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a computer  usually excluding the display  keyboard and mouse      cases are usually constructed from steel  often secc   steel  electrogalvanized  cold rolled  coil  or aluminium  plastic is sometimes used  and other materials such as glass  wood and even lego blocks have appeared in home built cases             cases can come in many different sizes  known as form factors   the size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard  since it is the largest component of most computers  consequently  personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case  form factors for rack mounted and blade servers may include precise external dimensions as well  since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures     for example  a case designed for an atx motherboard and power supply may take on several external forms  such as a vertical tower  designed to sit on the floor  height   width  or a flat desktop  height   width  or pizza box  height    xa cm   xa in   designed to sit on the desk under the computer s monitor   full size tower cases are typically larger in volume than desktop cases  with more room for drive bays and expansion slots  desktop cases and mini tower cases under about   xa cm    xa in  high are popular in business environments where space is at a premium      currently  the most popular form factor for desktop computers is atx  although microatx and small form factors have also become very popular for a variety of uses  in the high end segment the unofficial and loosely defined xl atx spec appeared around       xl atx extends the length of the mainboard to accommodate   graphics cards with dual slot coolers  some xl atx mainboards increase the mainboard s width as well  to allow more space for the cpu and memory pwm  and in some cases a second cpu socket  while the market share of these exotic high end mainboards is very low  almost all high end cases and many mainstream cases support xl atx     expansion slots   companies like in win development  shuttle inc  and aopen originally popularized small cases  for which flexatx was the most commondubious   discuss motherboard size  as of      mini itx has widely replaced flexatx as the most common small form factor mainboard standard  the latest mini itx mainboards from asus  gigabyte  zotac and foxconn offer the same feature set as full size mainboards  high end mini itx mainboards support standard desktop cpus  use standard memory dimm sockets and feature a full size pcie   x slot with support for the fastest graphics cards  this allows customers to build a fully fledged high end computer in a significantly smaller case  apple inc  has also produced the mac mini computer  which is similar in size to a standard cd rom drive     tower cases are often categorized as mini tower  mid tower or full tower  full tower cases are typically   xa cm    xa in  or more in height and intended to stand on the floor  they have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays  the ratio of external to internal bays is shifting  however  as computing technology moves from floppy disks and cd roms to large capacity hard drives  usb flash drives  and network based solutions  the full tower case was developed to house file servers which would typically be tasked with serving data from expensive cd rom databases which held more data than the hard drives commonly available  hence many full tower cases include locking doors and other physical security features to prevent the theft of the discs  midtower cases are smaller  about   xa cm    xa in  high with two to four external bays  a minitower case will typically have only one or two external bays and stand from   xa cm    xa in  to   xa cm    xa in  tall  in      coolermaster introduced the cosmos ii  ultra tower  case  standing   xa cm    xa in  tall and featuring    drive bays    this is a high end case intended for desktop systems and doesn t include security features     computer cases usually include sheet metal enclosures for a power supply unit and drive bays  as well as a rear panel that can accommodate peripheral connectors protruding from the motherboard and expansion slots  most cases also have a power button or switch  a reset button  and leds to indicate power status as well as hard drivecitation needed and network activity  in some models   some cases include built in i o ports  such as usb and headphone ports  on the front of the case  such a case will also include the wires needed to connect these ports  switches and indicators to the motherboard        the top of the case  usually allowing the psu s built in fan to act as an auxiliary exhaust fan  but causes the psu to be fed air heated by the internal components of the case  thus causing psu efficiency and lifespan degradation        the bottom of the case  with a  often filtered  vent in the bottom of the case allowing the psu to draw cool air from the outside  regardless of the mounting position  the psu will usually be attached to the case with four screws to support its weight     accessing the interior of a modern tower case is done by removing the left and right side panels  looking front to back  accessing the motherboard  psu  drive bays and most case fan installation points is done by removing the left side panel  removing the right side panel is done to access the space behind the motherboard mounting plate  this space is devoted to cable management  as cables routed in front of the motherboard will cause disruptions in the flow of air within the case  alternatively  the case may have a single large cover that saddles the chassis     to prevent the buildup of performance degrading dust within the case  many models feature dust filters in front of the air intake fans  while the exact method of accessing the front filters depends on the case model  it usually requires the removal of the entire front panel  removal of the front panel itself may or may not require the removal of one or both of the side panel  if there is any doubt  consult the user s manual if possible  if you remain uncertain of how to detach the front panel  remove both side panels and perform a visual inspection of the fastening method before attempting to remove the front panel  after washing the filters  make sure that they re dry before re installing them into the case     traditionally  most computer cases required computer case screws to hold components and panels in place  i e  motherboard  psu  drives  and expansion cards   from the     s there is a trend towards tool less cases  in which components are held together with snap in plastic rails  thumbscrews  and other methods that do not require tools  this facilitates quick assembly and modification of computer hardware     through the     s  most computer cases had simple rectangular shapes  and were often painted beige or white with little attention given to visual design  beige box designs are still found on a large number of budget computers assembled from generic components  this class of machines is still known as white box computers     case modding is the artistic styling of computer cases  often to draw attention to the use of advanced or unusual components  since the early     s  some cases have included clear side panels or acrylic windows so that users can look inside while it is operating  modded cases may also include internal lighting  custom paint  or liquid cooling systems  some hobbyists build custom cases from raw materials like aluminum  steel  styrofoam  acrylic  or wood     prominent after market case manufacturers include antec  aopen  chieftec  cooler

button  which connects to the motherboard  when the case is opened  the switch position changes and the system records this change  the system s firmware or bios may be configured to report this event the next time it is powered on     this physical intrusion detection system may help computer owners detect tampering with their computer  however  most such systems are quite simple in construction  a knowledgeable intruder can open the case or modify its contents without triggering the switch     in the past  many tower cases intended to house file servers featured a locking door covering the external drive bays  this was a security feature intended to prevent the theft of the cd rom discs the drives would be holding  at the time  cd rom capacity was larger than the hard disks available  and many business critical databases were distributed on this media  these databases were often very expensive or held proprietary data  and hence would be likely targets for casual theft     swtpc
