 in microeconomics  economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to size  output  or scale of operation  with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units of output     often operational efficiency is also greater with increasing scale  leading to lower variable cost as well     economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels  such as a business or manufacturing unit  plant or an entire enterprise  for example  a large manufacturing facility would be expected to have a lower cost per unit of output than a smaller facility  all other factors being equal  while a company with many facilities should have a cost advantage over a competitor with fewer     some economies of scale  such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment  have a physical or engineering basis     the economic concept dates back to adam smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor   diseconomies of scale are the opposite     economies of scale often have limits  such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase  common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply  such as wood in the lumber  pulp and paper industry  a common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market  thus having to ship product uneconomical distances  other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate     large producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade  a commodity  and find it costly to switch grades frequently  they will therefore avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins  often smaller  usually older  manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity grade production to specialty products               the simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size or speed of operation   economies of scale often originate with fixed capital  which is lowered per unit of production as design capacity increases  in wholesale and retail distribution  increasing the speed of operations  such as order fulfillment  lowers the cost of both fixed and working capital  other common sources of economies of scale are purchasing  bulk buying of materials through long term contracts   managerial  increasing the specialization of managers   financial  obtaining lower interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments   marketing  spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets   and technological  taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function   each of these factors reduces the long run average costs  lrac  of production by shifting the short run average total cost  sratc  curve down and to the right     economies of scale is a practical concept that may explain real world phenomena such as patterns of international trade or the number of firms in a market  the exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries  it is also a justification for free trade policies  since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country for example  it would not be efficient for liechtenstein to have its own car maker  if they only sold to their local market  a lone car maker may be profitable  but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market  economies of scale also play a role in a  natural monopoly      the management thinker and translator of the toyota production system for service  professor john seddon  argues that attempting to create economies by increasing scale is powered by myth in the service sector  instead  he believes that economies will come from improving the flow of a service  from first receipt of a customer s demand to the eventual satisfaction of that demand  in trying to manage and reduce unit costs  firms often raise total costs by creating failure demand  seddon claims that arguments for economy of scale are a mix of a  the plausibly obvious and b  a little hard data  brought together to produce two broad assertions  for which there is little hard factual evidence      some of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis  such as the square cube law  by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube  this law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings  factories  pipelines  ships and airplanes      in structural engineering  the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness     drag loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume  although the physical details can be quite complicated  therefore  making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed     heat losses from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes  tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square cube law      overall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale  a crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known  changing the size will change the capital cost by the     power of the capacity ratio  the point six power rule        in estimating capital cost  it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor  and possibly not much more in materials  to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity       the cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment  such as electric motors  centrifugal pumps  diesel and gasoline engines  decreases as size increases  also  the efficiency increases with size       operating crew size for ships  airplanes  trains  etc   does not increase in direct proportion to capacity     operating crew consists of pilots  co pilots  navigators  etc  and does not include passenger service personnel   many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or  stretched  to increase payload       many manufacturing facilities  especially those making bulk materials like chemicals  refined petroleum products  cement and paper  have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity  this is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate  and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment  regardless of production capacity     karl marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste    marx cited the chemical industry as an example  which today along with petrochemicals  remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products  in the pulp and paper industry it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce process steam and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to usable form     economies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale  where economies of scale refer to a firm s costs  returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long run  all inputs variable  production function  a production function has constant returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion  returns are decreasing if  say  doubling inputs results in less than double the output  and increasing if more than double the output  if a mathematical function is used to represent the production function  and if that production function is homogeneous  returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function  homegeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous  increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one  and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one     if the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets  and thus the per unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases  then it can be shown that at a particular level of output  the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale  has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale  and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale        in this case  with perfect competition in the output market the long run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long run average cost curves  i e   at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale      if  however  the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets  then the above conclusions are modified  for example  if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels  but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input s per unit cost  then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels  conversely  if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input  then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range     the literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of reverse auction  and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins  suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue  buyers  in turn  benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes  in part as a result  numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers  and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs       however  surprisingly enough  shalev and asbjornsen found  in their research based on     reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers  that the higher auction volume  or economies of scale  did not lead to better success of the auction  they found that auction volume did not correlate with competition  nor with the number of bidder  suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition  they noted  however  that their data included a wide range of products  and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly  and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes  keeping competitive factors constant  increasing auction volume may further increase competition
