 the apple pippin is an open platform  multimedia technology platform   designed by apple computer  and marketed as pipp n  according to apple  pippin was directed at the home market as  an integral part of the consumer audiovisual  stereo  and television environment       pippin is based on the apple macintosh platform  in particular the mac os architecture  apple built a demonstration device based on pippin called  pippin power player   and used it to demonstrate the platform at trade shows and to the media  in order to attract potential software developers and hardware manufacturers   apple licensed the pippin technology to third party companies  bandai company ltd  developed the atmark and  world models  and focused them on the gaming and entertainment business in japan and the united states  katz media developed the kmp       and focused it on vertical markets throughout europe and canada             the apple pippin platform was named for the newtown pippin  an apple cultivar  a smaller and more tart relative of the mcintosh apple  which is the namesake of the macintosh    according to apple  it intended for pippin to be more than just a platform for game consoles   apple believes that over time pippin will take many forms  including home telecommunication devices and much more  apple did not want to choose a name that would be specific for a certain market space  as it will certainly appeal to many types of consumers and be shipped in a variety of forms from many manufacturers       the word  pippin  was used by apple prior to the apple pippin platform  the apple profile  an external hard disk drive for the apple iii and apple lisa  used the code name  pippin  during development      apple never intended to release pippin on its own  apple intended to make the pippin platform an open standard  by licensing the technology to third parties  much like how jvc shared the vhs format in the     s   relying on third party companies to produce pippin systems was a way to increase macintosh s market share   a goal identical to apple s clone attempt in the late     s   it even encouraged differentiation between systems  in order to encourage competition   as long as the systems stuck to apple s reference design to avoid fragmentation   the licensees could improve its systems by improving industrial design  integrating telephony  improving video and audio capabilities  increasing memory capacity  and more      in       bandai wanted to deliver a scaled down version macintosh purely for cd rom game playing  bandai president and ceo makoto yamashina chose the macintosh platform over other platforms available at the time      in early       bandai approached apple with the gaming console idea  the original design was based on a macintosh classic ii   xa mhz motorola       running macintosh system software  apple s involvement would be to define the initial logic board design  and bandai would provide the casing and packaging  this was considered the fastest delivery solution to market at a very reasonable return on investment for both apple and bandai     originally  bandai never intended to develop a system with internet connectivity in mind   however  apple and bandai received feedback from customers  indicating that they were looking for a system that could connect to the internet  to make internet connectivity possible  apple had to implement a modem into the pippin design  two years earlier         apple had already moved away from the older serial interface with an external hayes compatible modem on its macintosh systems  and switched to a serial interface which included geoport   a serial data technology that allowed software to emulate a modem  implementing geoport into the pippin platform required apple to make a major change in its design   moving away from the       footprint and to a powerpc footprint  apple chose the powerpc        bit processor  as it was designed to be a low cost  low end processor for embedded use     on december           apple announced the pippin platform in tokyo  as well as the partnership with bandai  on march           the white colored bandai pippin atmark             pipin attom ku   went on sale in japan at a price of        yen  which included a dial up modem and four bundled titles  yamashina predicted sales of         pippin atmark systems would be sold in japan within the first twelve months      in october       the nihon keizai shimbun reported that mitsubishi electric corporation would follow bandai as a licensee to the pippin technology  although mitsubishi didn t actually sign a license agreement with apple  it did manufacture the systems for bandai  and effectively  katz media  on an original equipment manufacturer basis      the black colored bandai pippin  world  pronounced at world  went on sale in the united states on september         at a price of us         the  world bundle included a six month unlimited internet account from psinet at a cost of us       per month  bandai predicted         pippin  world systems would be sold within twelve months      by       the bandai  world was extremely unpopular in the united states   bandai pulled the  world out of the american market  and shipped the unsold units back to japan   the black colored units were re branded atmark  and without the atmark labeling on the front   and sold in the japanese market      on june          katz media  based in norway  became the second  and last  company to sign a license agreement with apple to produce pippin systems   while bandai was targeting the japan and united states markets  katz media focused on europe and canada  because katz media was a media software only company  it signed an agreement with bandai so that bandai would produce the hardware as an oem for katz media       katz media originally intended to produce two configurations of the pippin  one as a basic multimedia system for running cd rom titles  and a higher end system supporting internet access    the goal was to start shipping pippin units in november         but didn t actually start shipping product until march         also  it ended up producing only one model of the pippin   the pippin kmp         the kmp      was available in two configurations  with or without an external    pin centronics scsi interface on the back of the unit     to develop content  katz media worked with a variety of multimedia developers and publishers to  pippinize  their existing cd rom titles and make them available for the pippin       katz media never sold the kmp      in the retail market  instead  it attempted to use the system as a set top box for a television set or vga display  to be distributed to its partners  client base in order to interface with a variety of vertically marketed interests  such as catalogs  databases  internet content  and so on    as a result  the katz media kmp      is the rarest of the pippin systems  and is extremely difficult to find in today s used market     katz media signed onto a number of agreements with companies across europe and canada  one agreement was to publish cd rom based catalogs for redwall retail stores  and use the pippin as an interactive kiosk that would be left in stores running the cd roms    katz media also attempted to push the kmp      into canada   a country that in may      had only    percent of its citizens with access to the internet    the idea was to use the country s existing cable network to bring in internet access  and the kmp      was to be used as an internet appliance that would be issued to subscribers    a hotel chain in europe signed a deal with katz media to use the kmp      in hotel rooms  so that guests can access the internet    katz media then signed with a hospital in france  using the kmp      as an on line system so that as a team  physicians can pull up and review case studies  and collaborate on diagnoses and treatments    on june           the netface consortium in the netherlands selected the kmp      as the device to be used as a part of what the company called  the world s first internet shopping mall     cai westland owned a two way cable environment with        subscribers  and the kmp      was to be given to the subscribers as a device to shop for products from a consortium of    companies       when steve jobs returned to apple in       he stopped all macintosh clone efforts  which shut down the apple pippin concept  once apple stopped all development of the pippin platform  it affected all parties  bandai stopped production of all models of pippin by mid         katz media  who was receiving its systems from bandai  vowed to continue supporting pippin in a pr notice released june             katz media reportedly had some         units committed because of written agreements with companies spanning twenty countries    the company would eventually file for bankruptcy by the end of         on february           daystar digital purchased all remaining inventory of hardware from bandai  and sold the inventory to anyone who would buy them      a former employee of daystar placed sales of the pippin through its distribution chain as high as       systems       bandai continued to support its consoles until december              to encourage software developers to create content for the pippin platform  apple attempted to sell the platform as being scalable  in that applications written for  example  the atmark or  world would work in future models of pippin  in apple s q a document  apple contrasted its scalability with the nintendo system  where the  nintendo   bit nes cartridges don t work on the    bit snes    the cd roms did not contain region protection  so that titles made for the atmark would also run on the  world  apple also promised the developers that   apple has no intention or desire to enter the business of regulating an industry which should be encouraged to exercise freedoms needed by the creative artists which apple wants to evangelize onto the platform  apple will abide by whatever ratings systems are regulated by governments  apple  where reasonable  will endorse those systems which reduce excessive oversight and permit the freedom to the artists    an example of this is the yellows series by akira gomi  originally a book displaying nude japanese women  it was converted to an electronic database     to develop pippin applications  developers had to become apple registered developers  so that they could receive the developer kits  as well as receive discounts on equipment required for pippin development  such as the power macintosh av system  at the may      world wide developers conference  wwdc   details were made available to potential developers   bandai also issued a  pippin security key  in the pippin hardware development kit  which when inserted into the applejack adb port allowed an off the shelf pippin system to bypass the authentication system when running non authenticated cd roms       on may           oracle corporation  along with    hardware and software vendors  announced an intent to build computers that are designed around the network computer platform    the idea was to design technology based on a profile that included diskless computers  commonly coded applications using languages such as java  and interface with the internet using common software such as netscape navigator  in may       apple became a partner in the network computing effort  and used the apple pippin platform as its implementation    katz media attempted to use the network computer platform concept as a way to push the pippin into vertical markets        although the apple imac        is popularly known for the disappearance of the floppy disk    the apple pippin platform was about two years ahead of the imac in this effort     the apple pippin platform was based on the powerpc platform  a platform designed and supported by ibm and apple  the powerpc     processor utilized risc    thereby allowing peripherals to rely on the internal processor in the pippin to perform much of the cpu processing  for example  instead of relying on a fully featured analog modem  the pippin had integrated geoport support on the serial port  this allowed to simplify the design of an external line adapter  daa   and therefore utilize the high speed risc processor as a data pump for the daa  various dial up internet service providers  isp    including prodigy  america on line  and eworld   were supported by the pippin platform  as well as generic local and national isps     the address bus of the powerpc     can theoretically access memory up to    mb  however  the operating system s maximum addressable memory size is    mb    furthermore  because of the asic design of the pippin hardware  the maximum ram size that can be added is    mb    officially  bandai produced memory upgrade modules of         and    mb  the memory chips are soldered onto a printed circuit board  and is placed in a plastic housing  making installation into a pippin system simple for the end user    japanese hackers produced an aftermarket    mb module    but because the module was much larger than the memory module compartment on the pippin  installation requires removing the logic board from the chassis  and then mounting the large memory module in between the logic board and chassis       apple encouraged hardware developers to produce pci compatible peripherals that can be added to the pippin  the only official method of producing add ons for the pippin was by developing pci compatible devices  and then placed in a docking station cabinet  a proprietary riser card interface  referred to by apple as a x pci slot  is located on the bottom of a pippin system  and is used by docking stations  a docking station for a pippin can contain a variety of hardware  such as scsi or floppy disk drive controllers  video interfaces  codecs  or network interfaces such as ethernet  the logic board passes pci signals through the x pci docking interface  and then to the docking station    docking stations within the pippin line do not provide pass through support  thereby limiting a pippin system to use only one docking station at one time  for example  a docking station for a floppy disk drive would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive  katz media produced a generic docking station  containing a pci slot  allowing a user to install pci cards  in       the pci adapter was sold by itself in the used market    the pci adapter without the docking station is difficult to use  since the pippin can t sit flat on a surface with the adapter and the pci card underneath    the pci docking station and the pci adapter can only be used on a pippin system with the kinka     rom bios    no pci based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the pippin     as bandai specifically marketed its pippin models as game consoles  many of the titles produced were games and entertainment software  i e  edutainment software  because the pippin platform was based on macintosh system software  graphic services such as  d and  d quickdraw were made available to developers  early on  apple encouraged hardware developers to produce  d rendering hardware so that the risc processor could be free to tend to other processing  mpeg codec was not supported by the system software  as quicktime was the only video format supported by the platform     the operating system is not located in the pippin s onboard storage  and is instead located on the cd roms for each of the pippin s software releases    apple could thus upgrade the operating system without having to sell new hardware to the consumer    however  because of this  once pippin software releases came to a halt  it became impossible to upgrade to a later operating system  or install extensions and such  the system automatically reboots whenever the cd rom eject button is pushed  so a user can not load the system software off one cd rom  and then insert another cd rom  apple intended for the pippin platform to be an appliance  and encouraged consumers to purchase a fully featured macintosh system if they were looking for something upgradable  bandai never upgraded its system software beyond the       version  hardware enthusiasts have been able to run system software as late as mac os      but this can only be done on a system utilizing a developer rom bios       on a typical powerpc based macintosh system  the boot process includes loading a bootstrap loader from rom  loading the process manager stored in the boot blocks of the startup device  locating a  blessed  system folder on the startup device  and then loading finder    however  because the pippin platform ran only on non writable cd rom  a modification to the boot process had to be made  for developers who were using standard       system software  a  pippinfinder  was installed into the system folder  allowing the cd rom to be bootable on a pippin based system  once development was finalized  pippinfinder was removed from the system folder  and the pippin specific system software was placed onto the build  in addition  an alias of the main executable was placed into the startup items folder  so that upon bootup  the application will launch automatically     developers had the challenge of using temporary memory more efficiently    since the pippin platform did not utilize a writable device such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive  developers were told to code their programs to the out of the box specifications  only ram based memory was available for storing data  pippin had     kb of internal nvram  but that had to be shared with the operating system and other applications   developers were not allowed to cache sound or video clips on a hard disk drive if one was available  also  the base specification for pippin had to be addressed by the developers  so that their applications can work without requiring the customer to purchase additional memory  the operating system and video used roughly     mb of the   mb ram in a typical pippin  therefore  developers were encouraged to keep the memory usage at     mb  an optional     inch disk drive capable of reading and writing high density disks was not standard equipment  but was available via a docking unit add on     the standard finder interface was also replaced with a simpler interface called  pippin launch   in finder  the interface was based on folders and files  in pippin launch  the icons are clickable squares  and the user did not have access to standard finder features  such as  new folder   maxi enterprise produced a cd rom called pease turbo  japanese  using pippin launch as its interface  and allows the user to access various resources within the pippin system   including the built in clock  appletalk  volume  and more     among developers   pippinized  was a reference to creating cd rom titles designed to boot on a pippin device    the requirements to producing pippinized cd rom discs include a power macintosh system  a scsi based external hard drive with     mb or more  a pippin console with the developer rom bios or developer dongle  and a cd r burner capable of burning at  x speed  toast pro for the power macintosh is the only cd r burning software supported  the system and application software is prepared on the external hard disk drive  and with the use of a dongle  available only to developers   is tested by booting off the hard disk drive on the pippin system  the dongle allows the pippin to boot from a volume that does not contain the  pippinauthenticationfile  file    once testing is finished  an image of the build is burned onto cd r  and more testing is performed on the pippin system     after the cd r is made  the disc had to be sent out to an authorized cd stamping house to be authenticated    rsa s public private key system was used to create the authentication system on the pippin platform  each authorized cd stamping house had its own public and private key pairs  and  the pippin hardware had its set of keys  apple hosted the internet based e mail system to process private key requests  every cd rom title had to be registered with apple by applying for the private key via e mail  the key is then used to encrypt the cd rom prior to stamping  when the pippin system is being booted using the cd rom  the pippin rom verifies the authenticity with its own set of keys  the disc itself was not encrypted  the  message  was the entire contents of the disc   so that even a non pippin system  such as a macintosh or a windows system running hfs drivers can read the disc  although rsa has been broken years later  no evidence of anyone hacking pippin s keys has been found     other than the rsa authentication and modified system files  according to apple   yes  pippin titles will play on macintosh computers  if the titles are   k based they will play on both power macintosh and   k based macintosh computers  if the titles are written in native powerpc code they might also play on both platforms depending upon whether or not the developer chose to code in fat binaries or not    macintosh systems cannot boot from a pippinized cd rom disc  but the disc can be read after the macintosh boots using the correct version of mac os     once bandai licensed pippin from apple  apple made no effort to market the pippin platform  all the marketing was to be done by the licensees    bandai spent us    million in marketing alone to sell the pippin line   as part of the licensing agreement  both bandai and katz media were not allowed to use the term  computer  when marketing the pippin systems  so that the systems would not be confused with apple s own macintosh product line       by the time the pippin systems were released  the market was already dominated by the sega saturn  sony playstation  and the  mostly windows based  pc  in addition  despite apple s efforts to sign on software developers  there was little ready to use software for pippin  the only major publisher being bandai itself  at a price of us     on launch    it was considered too expensive in comparison to its contemporaries     in may       pc graphics report interviewed a japanese executive associated with bandai    according to the article that documented the interview  attempting to market a gaming console as a computer was a sign of lack of cultural research on the part of the japan based bandai    in particular  computer illiterate people did not know what an     sign was  as in  world    consumers in america could not grasp the idea of surfing the internet using such a device    the executive could not understand how americans might not be interested in surfing the internet  the interviewer then referred the executive to a      study by the united states department of education  where it was found that approximately    to    percent of all adults residing in the u s  were considered functionally illiterate      and  any device that wasn t simple to use would be a failure in the u s  market     the same article also mentioned other problems with the pippin platform and marketing strategies    the out of the box memory configuration was too small to run the netscape     browser  or anything comparable to java and vrml support    also  the rendering of text on a tv screen made for difficulty reading web pages  since at the time the composite video output was the more commonly available connection to television sets    the us     price was too much   especially during the fall of      when the bandai pippin was originally released       apple intended to grow the pippin platform alongside the rest of the macintosh line  in an apple developer publication  apple s ceo gil amelio announced the pippin      reference platform  and suggested that the platform would include the latest macintosh technologies  including ieee      or firewire  as well as a    pin external scsi port as standard interfaces    in may       bandai announced a docking station that would include ethernet support at us         although such a peripheral was never made available       in       bandai developed two prototype units  and displayed them at the macworld expo tokyo     event  the bandai atmark pd was designed as a direct replacement of the original atmark footprint  and would have included an internal drive that can read a standard cd rom disc  as well as read write to a magneto optical worm pd disk with     mb of storage capacity       the bandai atmark ex was to feature a footprint similar to a macintosh desktop unit    it was designed to include   mb of ram  expandable to    mb   and the ability to utilize standard    pin edo dram modules  instead of the proprietary memory modules used in the atmark and  world  the chassis could handle a half sized pci card internally  the displayed unit contained a pci card based ethernet interface  as well as a built in analog modem  an infrared based adb interface was also designed into the prototype  which would have opened up a new line of peripherals     the white bandai atmark is the most common pippin system in existence today  about        systems were reportedly produced by bandai  it is unknown how many systems were actually sold to consumers  in the used market  the white atmark can be purchased brand new  most being sold out of japan  the drawback to the white bandai atmark is the kinka     rom bios   the first commercial version of the rom bios    this version restricts the system of upgrades  such as the magneto optical drive or a scsi hard disk drive    it also contains the rsa authentication system  which restricts the system from running un pippinized cd roms    collectors like the white atmark because they are usually brand new and complete  museum grade condition  and are readily available for purchase  hackers  however  do not like this release because of its rom bios s limitations       all black bandai  world units sold contain the kinka     rom bios    when bandai shipped the unsold  world systems from the united states to japan  it removed the kinka     rom bios  installed the kinka     rom bios  and re distributed the systems as atmark  bandai kept the black shell on these systems  but removed the  world labeling from the front  the kinka     rom bios allowed booting of non pippinized cd roms     the katz media kmp      was released with the kinka     rom bios included in the system  so it allowed katz media to support the kmp      and its client base without being locked down to the rsa authentication system  the kmp      was not officially designed specifically for software developers  software developers  and later collectors and hackers of pippin systems prefer the kinka     rom bios because of a lack of the rsa system  support for the pci expansion adapter  as well as support for booting from external hard disk drives and other scsi devices       the basic logic board design stayed the same throughout the life of the pippin platform  therefore the rom bios module of any version can be placed into any pippin system  this makes for a lucrative used market for just the rom bios module  the module is made up of a series of chips soldered onto a printed circuit board  and then inserted into the logic board via an edge connector  making it extremely difficult to reproduce  copies of the rom bios code are made available on the internet by enthusiasts  but only to encourage the development of pippin emulators     a pippin system can be turned into a developer system simply by installing either the developer or kinka     rom bios  and then modifying the middle metal lip on the back of the chassis  allowing a ribbon scsi interface cable to slip through the back from the internal scsi interface       according to apple  what would be included in a pippin based product was specific to each manufacturer   other than the color  the specifications on the bandai releases were the same across both the atmark and  world packages  while the katz media release addressed features needed to be scalable  including an external scsi interface  additional on board memory  and the lack of rsa technology         hard drive is supported by the pre release rom bios  but only if a zip     is detected as part of the scsi chain     standard equipment in every apple pippin package includes a dial up analog modem  earlier packages included a      kbit s modem  pa       or pa         while later packages included a      kbit s modem  pa       bde         over a geoport interface  and one corded applejack game pad     originally  expansion of the pippin was to be by way of the docking station  apple was looking forward to third party manufacturers producing add on products  such as pcmcia slots  mpeg   codecs  among others   some add ons were made available by bandai and other third party manufacturers  and included     note that earlier releases of the bandai pippin atmark could not use the    mb mo drive  later models had this support added  bandai nor apple sold the rom bios upgrades as a finished good     other peripherals not designed specifically for the pippin line can also be used without modification of the hardware or operating system     standard apple made adb devices  such as the apple keyboard line  and the apple desktop bus mouse  can be used on a pippin by way of an adb to applejack adapter  applejack devices can be used on an adb based macintosh by creating a home made applejack to adb adapter  pa       bde        which didn t exist as a finished good  some devices  such as the applejack game pad  pa         require extensions for the macintosh system software
