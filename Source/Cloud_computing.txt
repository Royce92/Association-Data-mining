 cloud computing is a computing term or metaphor that evolved in the late     s  based on utility and consumption of computing resources  cloud computing involves deploying groups of remote servers and software networks that allow centralized data storage and online access to computer services or resources  clouds can be classified as public  private or hybrid               cloud computing  relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale  similar to a utility  like the electricity grid  over a network   at the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of converged infrastructure and shared services     cloud computing  or in simpler shorthand just  the cloud   also focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of the shared resources  cloud resources are usually not only shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated per demand  this can work for allocating resources to users  for example  a cloud computer facility that serves european users during european business hours with a specific application  e g   email  may reallocate the same resources to serve north american users during north america s business hours with a different application  e g   a web server   this approach should maximize the use of computing power thus reducing environmental damage as well since less power  air conditioning  rack space  etc  are required for a variety of functions  with cloud computing  multiple users can access a single server to retrieve and update their data without purchasing licenses for different applications     the term  moving to cloud  also refers to an organization moving away from a traditional capex model  buy the dedicated hardware and depreciate it over a period of time  to the opex model  use a shared cloud infrastructure and pay as one uses it      proponents claim that cloud computing allows companies to avoid upfront infrastructure costs  and focus on projects that differentiate their businesses instead of on infrastructure   proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster  with improved manageability and less maintenance  and enables it to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business demand     cloud providers typically use a  pay as you go  model  this can lead to unexpectedly high charges if administrators do not adapt to the cloud pricing model      the present availability of high capacity networks  low cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization  service oriented architecture  and autonomic and utility computing have led to a growth in cloud computing     companies can scale up as computing needs increase and then scale down again as demands decrease    cloud vendors are experiencing growth rates of     per annum       the origin of the term cloud computing is unclear  the expression cloud is commonly used in science to describe a large agglomeration of objects that visually appear from a distance as a cloud and describes any set of things whose details are not inspected further in a given context    another explanation is that the old programs to draw network schematics surrounded the icons for servers with a circle  and a cluster of servers in a network diagram had several overlapping circles  which resembled a cloud       in analogy to above usage the word cloud was used as a metaphor for the internet and a standardized cloud like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics and later to depict the internet in computer network diagrams  with this simplification  the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram  the cloud symbol was used to represent the internet as early as           in which servers were then shown connected to  but external to  the cloud     references to cloud computing in its modern sense appeared early as       with the earliest known mention in a compaq internal document       the popularization of the term can be traced to      when amazon com introduced the elastic compute cloud       the underlying concept of cloud computing dates to the     s  when large scale mainframe computers were seen as the future of computing  and became available in academia and corporations  accessible via thin clients terminal computers  often referred to as  dumb terminals   because they were used for communications but had no internal processing capacities  to make more efficient use of costly mainframes  a practice evolved that allowed multiple users to share both the physical access to the computer from multiple terminals as well as the cpu time  this eliminated periods of inactivity on the mainframe and allowed for a greater return on the investment  the practice of sharing cpu time on a mainframe became known in the industry as time sharing    during the mid   s  time sharing was popularly known as rje  remote job entry   this nomenclature was mostly associated with large vendors such as ibm and dec  ibm developed the vm operating system to provide time sharing services     in the     s  telecommunications companies  who previously offered primarily dedicated point to point data circuits  began offering virtual private network  vpn  services with comparable quality of service  but at a lower cost  by switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use  they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively  they began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for  cloud computing extends this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure       as computers became more prevalent  scientists and technologists explored ways to make large scale computing power available to more users through time sharing  they experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure  platform  and applications to prioritize cpus and increase efficiency for end users       since      cloud computing has come into existence  in early       opennebula  enhanced in the reservoir european commission funded project  became the first open source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds  and for the federation of clouds    in the same year  efforts were focused on providing quality of service guarantees  as required by real time interactive applications  to cloud based infrastructures  in the framework of the irmos european commission funded project  resulting in a real time cloud environment    by mid       gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing  to shape the relationship among consumers of it services  those who use it services and those who sell them    and observed that  organizations are switching from company owned hardware and software assets to per use service based models  so that the  projected shift to computingxa     will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas        microsoft azure became available in late          in july       rackspace hosting and nasa jointly launched an open source cloud software initiative known as openstack  the openstack project intended to help organizations offer cloud computing services running on standard hardware  the early code came from nasa s nebula platform as well as from rackspace s cloud files platform       on march          ibm announced the ibm smartcloud framework to support smarter planet    among the various components of the smarter computing foundation  cloud computing is a critical piece     on june          oracle announced the oracle cloud    while aspects of the oracle cloud are still in development  this cloud offering is posed to be the first to provide users with access to an integrated set of it solutions  including the applications  saas   platform  paas   and infrastructure  iaas  layers           cloud computing is the result of evolution and adoption of existing technologies and paradigms  the goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take bene t from all of these technologies  without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them  the cloud aims to cut costs  and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by it obstacles       the main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization  virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more  virtual  devices  each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks  with operating system level virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices  idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently  virtualization provides the agility required to speed up it operations  and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization  autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on demand  by minimizing user involvement  automation speeds up the process  reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors       users routinely face difficult business problems  cloud computing adopts concepts from service oriented architecture  soa  that can help the user break these problems into services that can be integrated to provide a solution  cloud computing provides all of its resources as services  and makes use of the well established standards and best practices gained in the domain of soa to allow global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way     cloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used  such metrics are at the core of the public cloud pay per use models  in addition  measured services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic computing  allowing services to scale on demand and to perform automatic failure recovery     cloud computing is a kind of grid computing  it has evolved by addressing the qos  quality of service  and reliability problems  cloud computing provides the tools and technologies to build data compute intensive parallel applications with much more affordable prices compared to traditional parallel computing techniques       cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics     the national institute of standards and technology s definition of cloud computing identifies  five essential characteristics      on demand self service  a consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities  such as server time and network storage  as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider     broad network access  capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms  e g   mobile phones  tablets  laptops  and workstations      resource pooling  the provider s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi tenant model  with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand xa     rapid elasticity  capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released  in some cases automatically  to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand  to the consumer  the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time     cloud computing providers offer their services according to several fundamental models        in the most basic cloud service model   according to the ietf  internet engineering task force   providers of iaas offer computers   physical or  more often  virtual machines   and other resources   a hypervisor  such as xen  oracle virtualbox  kvm  vmware esx esxi  or hyper v runs the virtual machines as guests  pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational support system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers  varying requirements   iaas clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual machine disk image library  raw block storage  and file or object storage  firewalls  load balancers  ip addresses  virtual local area networks  vlans   and software bundles    iaas cloud providers supply these resources on demand from their large pools installed in data centers  for wide area connectivity  customers can use either the internet or carrier clouds  dedicated virtual private networks      to deploy their applications  cloud users install operating system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure  in this model  the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software  cloud providers typically bill iaas services on a utility computing basis  cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed           in the paas models  cloud providers deliver a computing platform  typically including operating system  programming language execution environment  database  and web server  application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers  with some paas offers like microsoft azure and google app engine  the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually  the latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real time in cloud environments    even more specific application types can be provided via paas  e g   such as media encoding as provided by services as bitcodin transcoding cloud   or media io       in the business model using software as a service  saas   users are provided access to application software and databases  cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications  saas is sometimes referred to as  on demand software  and is usually priced on a pay per use basis or using a subscription fee     in the saas model  cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients  cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs  this eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user s own computers  which simplifies maintenance and support  cloud applications are different from other applications in their scalability which can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run time to meet changing work demand    load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines  this process is transparent to the cloud user  who sees only a single access point  to accommodate a large number of cloud users  cloud applications can be multitenant  that is  any machine serves more than one cloud user organization     the pricing model for saas applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user    so price is scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point       proponents claim saas allows a business the potential to reduce it operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider  this enables the business to reallocate it operations costs away from hardware software spending and personnel expenses  towards meeting other goals  in addition  with applications hosted centrally  updates can be released without the need for users to install new software  one drawback of saas is that the users  data are stored on the cloud provider s server  as a result  there could be unauthorized access to the data  for this reason  users are increasingly adopting intelligent third party key management systems to help secure their data     users access cloud computing using networked client devices  such as desktop computers  laptops  tablets and smartphones  some of these devices   cloud clients   rely on cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless without it  examples are thin clients and the browser based chromebook  many cloud applications do not require specific software on the client and instead use a web browser to interact with the cloud application  with ajax and html  these web user interfaces can achieve a similar  or even better  look and feel to native applications  some cloud applications  however  support specific client software dedicated to these applications  e g   virtual desktop clients and most email clients   some legacy applications  line of business applications that until now have been prevalent in thin client computing  are delivered via a screen sharing technology     private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization  whether managed internally or by a third party  and hosted either internally or externally   undertaking a private cloud project requires a significant level and degree of engagement to virtualize the business environment  and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources  when done right  it can improve business  but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities    self run data centers   are generally capital intensive  they have a significant physical footprint  requiring allocations of space  hardware  and environmental controls  these assets have to be refreshed periodically  resulting in additional capital expenditures  they have attracted criticism because users  still have to buy  build  and manage them  and thus do not benefit from less hands on management    essentially  lacking the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept          a cloud is called a  public cloud  when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use  public cloud services may be free    technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture  however  security consideration may be substantially different for services  applications  storage  and other resources  that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non trusted network  saasu is a large public cloud  generally  public cloud service providers like amazon aws  microsoft and google own and operate the infrastructure at their data center and access is generally via the internet  aws and microsoft also offer direct connect services called  aws direct connect  and  azure expressroute  respectively  such connections require customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud provider       hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds  private  community or public  that remain distinct entities but are bound together  offering the benefits of multiple deployment models  hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation  managed and or dedicated services with cloud resources      gartner  inc  defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private  public and community cloud services  from different service providers    a hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can t be simply put in one category of private  public  or community cloud service  it allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service  by aggregation  integration or customization with another cloud service     varied use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist  for example  an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application  but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service    this example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services  hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements  level of control needed over data  and the applications an organization uses       another example of hybrid cloud is one where it organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud    this capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds   cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and  bursts  to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases  a primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization only pays for extra compute resources when they are needed    cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in house it infrastructure that supports average workloads  and use cloud resources from public or private clouds  during spikes in processing demands       community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns  security  compliance  jurisdiction  etc    whether managed internally or by a third party  and either hosted internally or externally  the costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud  but more than a private cloud   so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized      cloud computing can also be provided by a distributed set of machines that are running at different locations  while still connected to a single network or hub service  examples of this include distributed computing platforms such as boinc and folding home  an interesting attempt in such direction is cloud home  aiming at implementing cloud computing provisioning model on top of voluntarily shared resources       the intercloud   is an interconnected global  cloud of clouds      and an extension of the internet  network of networks  on which it is based  the focus is on direct interoperability between public cloud service providers  more so than between providers and consumers  as is the case for hybrid  and multi cloud            multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors  increase flexibility through choice  mitigate against disasters  etc  it differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services  rather than multiple deployment modes  public  private  legacy          cloud architecture    the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing  typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue  elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others     cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computing  it brings a systematic approach to the high level concerns of commercialization  standardization  and governance in conceiving  developing  operating and maintaining cloud computing systems  it is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems  software  web  performance  information  security  platform  risk  and quality engineering     cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is on the cloud at any time  it could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information    many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order even without a warrant  that is permitted in their privacy policies which users have to agree to before they start using cloud services    solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users  choices for how data is stored    users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access       according to the cloud security alliance  the top three threats in the cloud are  insecure interfaces and api s   data loss   leakage   and  hardware failure  which accounted for          and     of all cloud security outages respectively   together these form shared technology vulnerabilities  in a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on same data server  therefore information leakage may arise by mistake when information for one customer is given to other    additionally  eugene schultz  chief technology officer at emagined security  said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud   there are some real achilles  heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into   because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers  hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attack   a process he called  hyperjacking      there is the problem of legal ownership of the data  if a user stores some data in the cloud  can the cloud provider profit from it    many terms of service agreements are silent on the question of ownership       physical control of the computer equipment  private cloud  is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else s control  public cloud   this delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services    some small businesses that don t have expertise in it security could find that it s more secure for them to use a public cloud     there is the risk that end users don t understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service  persons sometimes don t read the many pages of the terms of service agreement  and just click  accept  without reading   this is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work  for example for an intelligent personal assistant  apple s siri or google now      fundamentally private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner  however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user       according to gartner s hype cycle  cloud computing has reached a maturity that leads it into a productive phase  this means that most of the main issues with cloud computing have been addressed to a degree that clouds have become interesting for full commercial exploitation  this however does not mean that all the problems listed above have actually been solved  only that the according risks can be tolerated to a certain degree    cloud computing is therefore still as much a research topic  as it is a market offering    what is clear through the evolution of cloud computing services is that the cto is a major driving force behind cloud adoption    the major cloud technology developers continue to invest billions a year in cloud r d  for example  in      microsoft committed     of its     bn r d budget to cloud
