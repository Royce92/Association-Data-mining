 in computational complexity theory  a computational resource is a resource used by some computational models in the solution of computational problems     the simplest computational resources are computation time  the number of steps necessary to solve a problem  and memory space  the amount of storage needed while solving the problem  but many more complicated resources have been defined citation needed    a computational problem is generallycitation needed defined in terms of its action on any valid input  examples of problems might be  given an integer n  determine whether n is prime   or  given two numbers x and y  calculate the product x y   as the inputs get bigger  the amount of computational resources needed to solve a problem will increase  thus  the resources needed to solve a problem are described in terms of asymptotic analysis  by identifying the resources as a function of the length or size of the input  resource usage is often partially quantified using big o notation     computational resources are useful because we can study which problems can be computed in a certain amount of each computational resource  in this way  we can determine whether algorithms for solving the problem are optimal and we can make statements about an algorithm s efficiency  the set of all of the computational problems that can be solved using a certain amount of a certain computational resource is a complexity class  and relationships between different complexity classes are one of the most important topics in complexity theory     the term  computational resource  is commonly used to describe accessible computing equipment and software  see utility computing     there has been some effort to formally quantify computing capability  a bounded turing machine has been used to model specific computations using the number of state transitions and alphabet size to quantify the computational effort required to solve a particular problem
