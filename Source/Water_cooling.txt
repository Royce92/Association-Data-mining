 water cooling is a method of heat removal from components and industrial equipment  as opposed to air cooling  water is used as the heat conductor  water cooling is commonly used for cooling automobile internal combustion engines and large industrial facilities such as steam electric power plants  hydroelectric generators  petroleum refineries and chemical plants   other uses include cooling the barrels of machine guns  cooling of lubricant oil in pumps  for cooling purposes in heat exchangers  cooling products from tanks or columns  and recently  cooling of various major components inside high end personal computers  the main mechanism for water cooling is convective heat transfer citation needed            cooling water is the water removing heat from a machine or system  cooling water may be recycled through a recirculating system or used in a single pass once through cooling  otc  system  recirculating systems may be open if they rely upon cooling towers or cooling ponds to remove heat or closed if heat removal is accomplished with negligible evaporative loss of cooling water  a heat exchanger or condenser may separate non contact cooling water from a fluid being cooled   or contact cooling water may directly impinge on items like saw blades where phase difference allows easy separation  environmental regulations emphasize the reduced concentrations of waste products in non contact cooling water      water is inexpensive and non toxic  the advantages of using water cooling over air cooling include water s higher specific heat capacity  density  and thermal conductivity  this allows water to transmit heat over greater distances with much less volumetric flow and reduced temperature difference     for cooling cpu cores in computing equipment  the primary advantage of water cooling is that its tremendously increased ability to transport heat away from source to a secondary cooling surface allows for large  more optimally designed radiators rather than small  inefficient fins mounted directly on the heat source     the water jacket around an engine is also very effective at deadening mechanical noises  which makes the engine quieter  however  the primary disadvantage is that it costs significantly more than an air cooled engine system citation needed    water accelerates corrosion of metal parts and is a favorable medium for biological growth  dissolved minerals in natural water supplies are concentrated by evaporation to leave deposits called scale  cooling water often requires addition of chemicals to minimize corrosion and insulating deposits of scale and biofouling   in water cooling systems for electronic devices the use of deionized water is required  which must be carefully controlled in order to avoid contamination  which would cause a decrease in resistance of the water and subsequently increase risk of short circuits citation needed    an open water cooling system makes use of evaporative cooling  lowering the temperature of the remaining  unevaporated  water  this method was common in early internal combustion engines  until scale buildup was observed from dissolved salts and minerals in the water  modern open cooling systems continuously waste a fraction of recirculating water as blowdown to remove dissolved solids at concentrations low enough to prevent scale formation  some open systems use inexpensive tap water  but this requires higher blowdown rates than deionized or distilled water  purified water systems still require blowdown to remove accumulation of byproducts of chemical treatment to prevent corrosion and biofouling      modern automotive cooling systems are slightly pressurized  often to    psi  this raises the boiling point of the coolant and reduces evaporation      the use of water cooling carries the risk of damage from freezing  automotive and many other engine cooling applications require the use of a water and antifreeze mixture to lower the freezing point to a temperature unlikely to be experienced  antifreeze also inhibits corrosion from dissimilar metals and can increase the boiling point  allowing a wider range of water cooling temperatures   its distinctive odor also alerts operators to cooling system leaks and problems that would go unnoticed in a water only cooling system  the heated water can also be used to warm the air conditioning system inside the car  if so desired citation needed    other less common chemical additives are products to reduce surface tension  these additives are meant to increase the efficiency of automotive cooling systems  such products are used to enhance the cooling of underperforming or undersized cooling systems or in racing where the weight of a larger cooling system could be a disadvantage citation needed    since approximately      it is common to use water cooling for tubes of powerful transmitters  as these devices uses high operation voltages   around    kv   the use of deionized water is required and it has to be carefully controlled  modern solid state transmitters can be built so  that even high power transmitters do not require water cooling  water cooling is however also sometimes used for thyristors of hvdc valves  for which also the use of deionized water is required citation needed    cooling hot computer components with various fluids has been in use since at least as far back as the development of cray   in       using fluorinert  through the     s  water cooling for home pcs slowly gained recognition amongst enthusiasts  but it started to become noticeably more prevalent after the introduction of amd s hot running athlon processor in mid      citation needed as of       there are several manufacturers of water cooling components and kits  and some custom computer retailers include various setups of water cooling for their high performance systems     water cooling can be used to cool many computer components  but especially the cpu  water cooling usually uses a cpu water block  a water pump  and a heat exchanger  usually a radiator with a fan attached   water cooling can allow quieter  potentially fanless  operation  or improved processor speeds  overclocking   or a balance of both  less commonly  gpus  northbridges  southbridges  hard disk drives  memory  voltage regulator modules  vrms   and even power supplies can be water cooled      radiator size may vary  from   mm dual fan    mm  to     quad fan     mm  and thickness from   mm to   mm    water coolers for desktop computers were  until the end of the     s  homemade  they were made from car radiators  or more commonly  a car s heater core   aquarium pumps and home made water blocks  laboratory grade pvc and silicone tubing and various reservoirs  homemade using plastic bottles  or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic  usually clear  and or a t line  more recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case  this  and the trend to cpus of higher power dissipation  has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling  although only a very small minority of computers are water cooled citation needed    dedicated overclockers occasionally use vapor compression refrigeration or thermoelectric coolers in place of more common standard heat exchangers  water cooling systems in which water is cooled directly by the evaporator coil of a phase change system are able to chill the circulating coolant below the ambient air temperature  impossible with a standard heat exchanger  and  as a result  generally provide superior cooling of the computer s heat generating components  the downside of phase change or thermoelectric cooling is that it uses much more electricity  and antifreeze must be added due to the low temperature  additionally  insulation  usually in the form of lagging around water pipes and neoprene pads around the components to be cooled  must be used in order to prevent damage caused by condensation of water vapour from the air on chilled surfaces  common places from which to borrow the required phase transition systems are a household dehumidifier or air conditioner citation needed    an alternative cooling system  which enables components to be cooled below the ambient temperature  but which obviates the requirement for antifreeze and lagged pipes  is to place a thermoelectric device  commonly referred to as a  peltier junction  or  pelt  after jean peltier  who documented the effect  between the heat generating component and the water block  because the only sub ambient temperature zone now is at the interface with the heat generating component itself  insulation is required only in that localized area  the disadvantage to such a system is that pelts typically dissipate a lot of power  and the water cooling system must remove this heat in addition to that generated by the component citation needed    another possible danger is damaging condensation  due to the ambient air right around the pelt being cold  a proper installation requires that the peltier be  potted  with silicone epoxy  the epoxy is applied around the edges of the device  preventing air from entering or leaving the interior citation needed    apple s power mac g  was the first mainstream desktop computer to have water cooling as standard  dell followed suit by shipping their xps computers with liquid coolingcitation needed  using thermoelectric cooling to help cool the liquid  currently  dell s only computers to offer liquid cooling are their alienware desktops      electronics applications are progressively requiring   higher power components   reduced space envelope conventional heat removal methods are therefore quickly reaching their limits     liquid cooling techniques are increasingly being used for the thermal management of electronic components  this type of cooling is a solution to ensure the optimisation of energy efficiency while simultaneously minimising noise and space requirements  especially useful in supercomputers or data centers as maintenance of the racks is quick and easy  after disassembly of the rack  advanced technology quick release couplings eliminate spillage for the safety of operators and protects the integrity of fluids  no impurities in the circuits   these couplings are also capable of being locked  panel mounted   to allow blind connection in difficult to access areas  it is important in electronics technology to analyse the connection systems to ensure     industrial cooling towers may use river water  coastal water  seawater   or well water as their source of fresh cooling water  the large mechanical induced draft or forced draft cooling towers in industrial plants continuously circulate cooling water through heat exchangers and other equipment where the water absorbs heat  that heat is then rejected to the atmosphere by the partial evaporation of the water in cooling towers where upflowing air is contacted with the circulating downflow of water  the loss of evaporated water into the air exhausted to the atmosphere is replaced by  make up  fresh river water or fresh cooling water  since the evaporation of pure water is replaced by make up water containing carbonates and other dissolved salts  a portion of the circulating water is also continuously discarded as  blowdown  water to prevent the excessive build up of salts in the circulating water      on very large rivers  but more often at coastal and estuarine sites   direct cooled  systems are often used  instead  these industrial plants do not use cooling towers and the atmosphere as a heat sink  but put the waste heat to the river or coastal water instead  these otc systems thus rely upon a good supply of river water or seawater for their cooling needs  many facilities  particularly electric power plants  use millions of gallons of water per day for cooling    such facilities are built with intake structures designed to pump in large volumes of water at a high rate of flow  these structures tend to also pull in large numbers of fish and other aquatic organisms  which are killed or injured on the intake screens       the warmed water is returned directly to the aquatic environment  often at temperatures significantly  to aquatic life  above the ambient receiving water  thermal pollution of rivers  estuaries and coastal waters is a consideration when siting such plants     high grade industrial water  produced by reverse osmosis  and potable water are sometimes used in industrial plants requiring high purity cooling water     some nuclear reactors use heavy water as cooling  heavy water is employed in nuclear reactors because it is a weaker neutron absorber  this allows for the use of less enriched fuel  for the main cooling system  normal water is preferably employed through the use of a heat exchanger  as heavy water is much more expensive  reactors that use other materials for moderation  graphite  may also use normal water for cooling     water is an ideal cooling medium for vessels as they are constantly surrounded by water that generally remains at a low temperature throughout the year  this does however pose new challenges as cooling systems operating with sea water need to be manufactured from materials that are suitable for the environment  a heat exchanger for example will need to be manufactured from materials such as cupronickel  bronze or titanium to protect it from erosion or corrosion  the velocity will also need to be far more restricted compared with a fresh water cooling system  if the velocity is too low  then sand and other sediments can block the tubes  if the velocity is too high then the tubes can be eroded by the sediments in the water       water is a favorable environment for many life forms  water cooling may alter natural water environments and create new environments  flow characteristics of recirculating cooling water systems encourage colonization by sessile organisms to use the circulating supply of food  oxygen and nutrients  volumes of water lost during evaporative cooling may decrease natural habitat for aquatic organisms  water temperature increases modify aquatic habitat by increasing biochemical reaction rates and decreasing oxygen saturation capacity of the habitat  temperature increases initially favor a population shift from those requiring the high oxygen concentration of cold water to those enjoying advantages of increased metabolic rates in warm water    temperatures may become high enough to support thermophilic populations     biofouling of heat exchange surfaces can reduce heat transfer rates of the cooling system  and biofouling of cooling towers can alter flow distribution to reduce evaporative cooling rates  biofouling may also create differential oxygen concentrations increasing corrosion rates  otc and open recirculating systems are most susceptible to biofouling  biofouling may be inhibited by temporary habitat modifications  temperature differences may discourage establishment of thermophilic populations in intermittently operated facilities  and intentional short term temperature spikes may periodically kill less tolerant populations  biocides have been commonly used to control biofouling where sustained facility operation is required       large otc flow rates may immobilize slow swimming organisms including fish and shrimp on screens protecting the small bore tubes of the heat exchangers from blockage  high temperatures or pump turbulence and shear may kill or disable smaller organisms passing the screens entrained with the cooling water    in the u s   cooling water intake structures kill billions of fish and other organisms each year    more agile aquatic predators consume organisms impinged on the screens  and warm water predators and scavengers colonize the cooling water discharge to feed on entrained organisms     manufactured metals tend to revert to ores via electrochemical reactions of corrosion  water can accelerate corrosion as both an electrical conductor and solvent for metal ions and oxygen  corrosion reactions proceed more rapidly as temperature increases   preservation of machinery in the presence of hot water has been improved by addition of chemicals including zinc  chromates and phosphates  the first two have toxicity concerns    and the last has been associated with eutrophication    residual concentrations of biocides and corrosion inhibitors are of potential concern for otc and blowdown from open recirculating systems    with the exception of machines with short design life  closed recirculating systems require periodic cooling water treatment or replacement raising similar concern about ultimate disposal of cooling water containing chemicals used with environmental safety assumptions of a closed system     industrial cooling water regulationsnthe u s  clean water act requires the environmental protection agency  epa  to issue regulations on industrial cooling water intake structures    epa issued final regulations for new facilities in       amended            and for existing facilities in            water contains varying amounts of impurities from contact with the atmosphere  soil  and containers  cooling water treatments add other chemicals attempting to maintain satisfactory heat exchange     total dissolved solids or tds  sometimes called filtrable residue  is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of filtered water is evaporated    salinity measures water density or conductivity changes caused by dissolved materials    probability of scale formation increases with increasing total dissolved solids  solids commonly associated with scale formation are calcium and magnesium carbonate and sulfate  corrosion rates initially increase with salinity in response to increasing electrical conductivity  but then decrease after reaching a peak as higher levels of salinity decrease dissolved oxygen levels      water ionizes into hydronium  h o  cations and hydroxyl  oh  anions  the concentration of ionized hydrogen  as protonated water  is expressed as ph    low ph values increase rate of corrosion while high ph values encourage scale formation  amphoterism is uncommon among metals used in water cooling systems  but aluminum corrosion rates increase with ph values above    galvanic corrosion may be severe in water systems with copper and aluminum components  acid may be added to cooling water systems to prevent scale formation if the ph decrease will offset increased salinity and dissolved solids       concentrations of polyphosphates or phosphonates with zinc and chromates or similar compounds have been maintained in cooling systems to keep heat exchange surfaces clean so a film of gamma iron oxide and zinc phosphate may inhibit corrosion by passivating anodic and cathodic reaction points    these increase salinity and total dissolved solids  and phosphorus compounds may provide the limiting essential nutrient for algal growth contributing to biofouling of the cooling system or to eutrophication of natural aquatic environments receiving blowdown or otc water  chromates reduce biofouling in addition to effective corrosion inhibition  but residual toxicity in blowdown or otc water has encouraged reduced chromate concentrations and use of less flexible corrosion inhibitors    blowdown may also contain chromium leached from cooling towers constructed of wood preserved with chromated copper arsenate     some groundwater contains very little oxygen when pumped from wells  but most natural water supplies include dissolved oxygen  corrosion increases with increasing oxygen concentrations   dissolved oxygen approaches saturation levels in cooling towers  dissolved oxygen is desirable in blowdown or otc water being returned to natural aquatic environments     chlorine may be added in the form of hypochlorite to decrease biofouling  but is later reduced to chloride to minimize toxicity of blowdown or otc water returned to natural aquatic environments  hypochlorite is increasingly destructive to wooden cooling towers as ph increases  chlorinated phenols have been used as biocides or leached from preserved wood in cooling towers  both hypochlorite and pentachlorophenol have reduced effectiveness at ph values greater than      non oxidizing biocides may be more difficult to detoxify prior to release of blowdown or otc water to natural aquatic environments
