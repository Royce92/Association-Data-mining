 a root name server is a name server for the root zone of the domain name system of the internet  it directly answers requests for records in the root zone and answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers for the appropriate top level domain  tld   the root name servers are a critical part of the internet infrastructure because they are the first step in translating  resolving  human readable host names into ip addresses that are used in communication between internet hosts     a combination of limits in the dns and certain protocols  namely the practical size of unfragmented user datagram protocol  udp  packets  resulted in a decision to limit the number of root servers to thirteen server addresses  the use of anycast addressing permits the actual number of root server instances to be much larger  and is     as of    october     update              the domain name system is a hierarchical naming system for computers  services  or any resource participating in the internet  the top of that hierarchy is the root domain  the root domain does not have a formal name and its label in the dns hierarchy is an empty string  all fully qualified domain names  fqdns  on the internet can be regarded as ending with this empty string for the root domain  and therefore ending in a full stop character  the label delimiter   e g   www example com   this is generally implied rather than explicit  as modern dns software does not actually require that the terminating dot be included when attempting to translate a domain name to an ip address     the root domain contains all top level domains of the internet  as of june     update  it contains    generic top level domains  gtlds  and     country code top level domains  cctlds  in the root domain   in addition  the arpa domain is used for technical name spaces in the management of internet addressing and other resources  a test domain is used for testing internationalized domain names     when a computer on the internet needs to resolve a domain name  it uses resolver software to perform the lookup  a resolver breaks the name up into its labels from right to left  the first component  tld  is queried using a root server to obtain the responsible authoritative server  queries for each label return more specific name servers until a name server returns the answer of the original query     in practice  most of this information does not change very often over a period of hours and therefore it is cached by intermediate name servers or by a name cache built into the user s application  dns lookups to the root name servers may therefore be relatively infrequent  a survey in        reports that only    of all queries to the root servers were legitimate  incorrect or non existent caching was responsible for     of the queries        were for unknown tlds     were for lookups using ip addresses as if they were domain names  etc  some misconfigured desktop computers even tried to update the root server records for the tlds  a similar list of observed problems and recommended fixes has been published in rfc          although any local implementation of dns can implement its own private root name servers  the term  root name server  is generally used to describe the thirteen well known root name servers that implement the root name space domain for the internet s official global implementation of the domain name system     as of february     update  there are    root name servers specified  with names in the form letter root servers net  where letter ranges from a to m  this does not mean there are    physical servers  each operator uses redundant computer equipment to provide reliable service even if failure of hardware or software occurs  additionally  nine of the servers operate in multiple geographical locations using a routing technique called anycast addressing  providing increased performance and even more fault tolerance     ten servers were originally in the united states  some are now operated using anycast addressing  three servers were originally located in stockholm  i   amsterdam  k   and tokyo  m      older servers had their own name before the policy of using similar names was established     the choice of thirteen name servers was made because of limitations in the original dns specification why  which specifies a maximum packet size of     bytes when using the user datagram protocol  udp     technically however  fourteen name servers fit into an ipv  packet  the addition of ipv  addresses for the root name servers requires more than     bytes  which is facilitated by the edns  extension to the dns standard    while only thirteen names are used for the root name servers  there are many more physical servers  a  c  e  f  g  i  j  k  l and m servers now exist in multiple locations on different continents  using anycast address announcements to provide decentralized service  as a result most of the physical root servers are now outside the united states  allowing for high performance worldwide     there are also several alternative namespace systems with an alternative dns root using their own set of root name servers that exist in parallel to the mainstream name servers  the first  alternic  generated a substantial amount of press citation needed    the function of a root name server may also be implemented locally  or on a provider network  such servers are synchronized with the official root zone file as published by icann  and do not constitute an alternate root     as the root name servers are an important part of the internet  they have come under attack several times  although none of the attacks have ever been serious enough to severely affect the performance of the internet     the dns root server system advisory committee is an icann committee  however  the root zone is controlled by the united states department of commerce who must approve all changes to the root zone file requested by icann  icann s bylaws   assign authority over the operation of the root name servers of the domain name system to the dns root server system advisory committee     the root zone file is a small  about     kb  data set   whose publication is the primary purpose of root name servers     the root zone file is at the apex of a hierarchical distributed database called the domain name system  dns   this database is used by almost all internet applications to translate worldwide unique names like www wikipedia org into other identifiers such as ip addresses     the contents of the root zone file is a list of names and numeric ip addresses of the authoritative dns servers for all top level domains  tlds  such as com  org  edu  or the country code top level domains  on    december       there were     tlds and     different authoritative servers for those tlds listed  other name servers forward queries for which they do not have any information about authoritative servers to a root name server  the root name server  using its root zone file  answers with a referral to the authoritative servers for the appropriate tld or with an indication that no such tld exists
