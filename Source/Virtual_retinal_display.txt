 a virtual retinal display  vrd   also known as a retinal scan display  rsd  or retinal projector  rp   is a display technology that draws a raster display  like a television  directly onto the retina of the eye  the user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them             in a conventional display a real image is produced  the real image is either viewed directly or  as in the case with most head mounted displays  projected through an optical system and the resulting virtual image is viewed  the projection moves the virtual image to a distance that allows the eye to focus comfortably  in a vrd no real image is ever produced  rather  an image is formed directly on the retina of the user s eye  a block diagram of the vrd is shown in the figure above     to create an image with the vrd a photon source  or three sources in the case of a color display  is used to generate a coherent beam of light  the use of a coherent source  such as a laser diode  allows the system to draw a diffraction limited spot on the retina  the light beam is intensity modulated to match the intensity of the image being rendered  the modulation can be accomplished after the beam is generated  if the source has enough modulation bandwidth  as in the case of a laser diode  the source can be modulated directly     the resulting modulated beam is then scanned to place each image point  or pixel  at the proper position on the retina  a variety of scan patterns are possible  the scanner could be used in a calligraphic  vector  mode  in which the lines that form the image are drawn directly  or in a raster mode  much like standard computer monitors or television  use of the raster method of image scanning allows the vrd to be driven by standard video sources  to draw the raster  a horizontal scanner moves the beam to draw a row of pixels  the vertical scanner then moves the beam to the next line where another row of pixels is drawn     after scanning  the optical beam must be properly projected into the eye  the goal is for the exit pupil of the vrd to be coplanar with the entrance pupil of the eye  the lens and cornea of the eye will then focus the beam on the retina  forming a spot  the position on the retina where the eye focuses the spot is determined by the angle at which light enters the eye  this angle is determined by the scanners and is continually varying in a raster pattern  the brightness of the focused spot is determined by the intensity modulation of the light beam  the intensity modulated moving spot  focused through the eye  draws an image on the retina  the eye s persistence allows the image to appear continuous and stable     finally  the drive electronics synchronize the scanners and intensity modulator with the incoming video signal in such a manner that a stable image is formed      liquid crystal displays  lcds  currently are the primary active display devices for the presentation of entertainment and information  an image that is generated electronically is viewed with the optical system of the eye  the image you see is subject not only to the quality of the optical system of the eye  but also to the quality of the display and the environment in which the display is located     with a vrd  defects in the eye s optical system  such as damaged cornea and lens and reduced retinal sensitivity could be bypassed  as well as the problems of the display environment  such as ambient brightness  angle of view and display brightness  additionally  the seen image could be augmented with other information and brightness of the system doesn t affect the image formed on the retina    although the vrd is an output device  the technology lends itself to augmentation with eye tracking or eyegaze systems for input  eye tracking is currently used in advanced still and video cameras for focusing on the object you wish to record     this approach produces several advantages over conventional display devices      a brief review of how the eye forms an image will aid in understanding the vrd     a point source emits waves of light which radiate in ever expanding circles about the point  the pupil of an eye  looking at the source  will see a small portion of the wavefront  the curvature of the wavefront as it enters the pupil is determined by the distance of the eye from the source  as the source moves farther away  less curvature is exhibited by the wavefronts  it is the wavefront curvature which determines where the eye must focus in order to create a sharp image     if the eye is an infinite distance from the source  plane waves enter the pupil  the lens of the eye images the plane waves to a spot on the retina  the spot size is limited by the aberrations in the lens of the eye and by the diffraction of the light through the pupil  it is the angle at which the plane wave enters the eye that determines where on the retina the spot is formed  two points focus to different spots on the retina because the wavefronts from the points are intersecting the pupil at different angles     neglecting the aberrations in the lens of the eye  one can determine the limit of the eye s resolution based on diffraction through the pupil  using rayleigh s criteria the minimum angular resolution is computed as follows          in the past similar systems have been made by projecting a defocused image directly in front of the user s eye on a small  screen   normally in the form of large glasses  the user focused their eyes on the background  where the screen appeared to be floating  the disadvantage of these systems was the limited area covered by the  screen   the high weight of the small televisions used to project the display  and the fact that the image would appear focused only if the user was focusing at a particular  depth   limited brightness made them useful only in indoor settings as well     only recently a number of developments have made a true vrd system practical  in particular the development of high brightness leds have made the displays bright enough to be used during the day  and adaptive optics have allowed systems to dynamically correct for irregularities in the eye  although this is not always needed   the result is a high resolution screenless display with excellent color gamut and brightness  far better than the best television technologies     the vrd was invented by kazuo yoshinaka of nippon electric co  in        later work at the university of washington in the human interface technology lab resulted in a similar system in       most of the research into vrds to date has been in combination with various virtual reality systems  in this role vrds have the potential advantage of being much smaller than existing television based systems  they share some of the same disadvantages however  requiring some sort of optics to send the image into the eye  typically similar to the sunglasses system used with previous technologies  it also can be used as part of a wearable computer system      apart from the advantages mentioned before  the vrd system scanning light into only one eye allows images to be laid over one s view of real objects  for example  it could project an animated  x ray like image of a car s engine or the human body     vrd system also can show an image in each eye with an enough angle difference to simulate three dimensional scenes with high fidelity  if applied to video games  for instance  gamers could have an enhanced sense of reality that liquid crystal display glasses could never provide  because the vrd can refocus dynamically to simulate near and distant objects with a far superior level of realism     this system only generates essentially needed photons  and as such it is more efficient for mobile devices that are only designed to serve a single user  a vrd could potentially use tens or hundreds of times less power for mobile telephone and netbook based applications     another important advantage is privacy  only the intended user  in the usual case of single user devices  is able to see the image displayed  this kind of device is also less vulnerable to tempest type side channel leak of information     it is believed that vrd based laser or led displays are not harmful to the human eye  as they are of a far lower intensity than those that are deemed hazardous to vision  the beam is spread over a greater surface area  and does not rest on a single point for an extended period of time     to ensure that vrd device is safe  rigorous safety standards from the american national standards institute and the international electrotechnical commission were applied to the development of such systems  optical damage caused by lasers comes from its tendency to concentrate its power in a very narrow area  this problem is overcome in vrd systems as they are scanned  constantly shifting from point to point with the beams focus     damage to the eye could result if the laser stopped scanning with the beam focused on a single point  this can be prevented by an emergency safety system to detect the situation and shut it off     although the power required is low  light must be collected and focused down in a point  this is an inherent property with lasers  but not so simple with a led  advances in led technology will be needed to further concentrate the light coming from these devices     vrds have been investigated for military use as an alternative display system for helmet mounted displays  however no vrd based system has yet reached operational use and current military hmd development now appears focused on other technologies such as holographic waveguide optics     a system similar to car repair procedures can be used by doctors for complex operations  while a surgeon is operating  he or she can keep track of vital patient data  such as blood pressure or heart rate  on a vrd  for procedures such as the placement of a catheter stent  overlaid images prepared from previously obtained magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scans assist in surgical navigation     it was subsequently commercialised in august
