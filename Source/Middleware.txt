 middleware is a computer software that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system  it can be described as  software glues    middleware makes it easier for software developers to perform communication and input output  so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application  middleware is the software that connects software components or enterprise applications  middleware is the software layer that lies between the operating system and the applications on each side of a distributed computer network  typically  it supports complex  distributed business software applications     middleware is the infrastructure which facilitates creation of business applications  and provides core services like concurrency  transactions  threading  messaging  and the sca framework for service oriented architecture  soa  applications  it also provides security and enables high availability functionality to the enterprise     middleware includes web servers  application servers  content management systems  and similar tools that support application development and delivery  it is especially integral to information technology based on extensible markup language  xml   simple object access protocol  soap   web services  soa  web     infrastructure  and light weight directory access protocol ldap             the term is most commonly used for software that enables communication and management of data in distributed applications  in this more specific sense middleware can be described as the dash in client server  or the  to  in peer to peer citation needed    objectweb defines middleware as   the software layer that lies between the operating system and applications on each side of a distributed computing system in a network    services that can be regarded as middleware include enterprise application integration  data integration  message oriented middleware  mom   object request brokers  orbs   and the enterprise service bus  esb      distributed computing system middleware can loosely be divided into two categories   those that provide human time services  such as web request servicing  and those that perform in machine time  this latter middleware is somewhat standardized through the service availability forum and is commonly used in complex  embedded systems within telecom  defense and aerospace industries     the term middleware is used in other contexts as well  middleware is sometimes used in a similar sense to a software driver  an abstraction layer that hides detail about hardware devices or other software from an application     the distinction between operating system and middleware functionality is  to some extent  arbitrary  while core kernel functionality can only be provided by the operating system itself  some functionality previously provided by separately sold middleware is now integrated in operating systems  a typical example is the tcp ip stack for telecommunications  nowadays included in virtually every operating system  at the other end of the scale  the boundary between middleware and application has also moved  digital tv middleware for example usually provides enough functionality so that no  application  is needed for end users to be able to use the tv services     middleware is a relatively new addition to the computing landscape  it gained popularity in the     s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems  although the term had been in use since        it also facilitated distributed processing  the connection of multiple applications to create a larger application  usually over a network
