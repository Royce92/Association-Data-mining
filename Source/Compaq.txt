 compaq computer corporation was a company founded in       that developed  sold  and supported computers and related products and services  compaq produced some of the first ibm pc compatible computers  being the first company to legally reverse engineer the ibm personal computer    it rose to become the largest supplier of pc systems during the     s before being overtaken by hp in        struggling in the aftermath of the dot com bubble bust  compaq was acquired for us    billion by hp in         the compaq brand remains in use by hp for lower end systems      the company was formed by rod canion  jim harris and bill murto former texas instruments senior managers  murto  svp of sales  departed compaq in       while canion  president and ceo  and harris  svp of engineering  left under a shakeup in       which saw eckhard pfeiffer appointed president and ceo  pfeiffer served through the     s  ben rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for    years from      until september           when he retired and was succeeded by michael capellas  who served as the last chairman and ceo until its merger with hp       prior to its takeover the company was headquartered in a facility in northwest unincorporated harris county  texas  that now continues as hp s largest united states facility             compaq was founded in february      by rod canion  jim harris and bill murto  three senior managers from semiconductor manufacturer texas instruments  the three of them had left due to lack of faith and loss of confidence in ti s management  and initially considered but ultimately decided against starting a chain of mexican restaurants     each invested        to form the company  which was founded with the temporary name gateway technology  the name  compaq  was said to be derived from  compatibility and quality  but this explanation was an afterthought  the name was chosen from many suggested by ogilvy and mather  it being the name least rejected  the first compaq pc was sketched out on a table napkin by ted papajohn while dining with the founders in a houston pie shop     their first venture capital came from benjamin m  rosen and sevin rosen funds who helped the fledgling company secure      million to produce their initial computer   overall  the founders managed to raise     million from venture capitalists  as this gave stability to the new company as well as providing assurances to the dealers or middlemen     unlike many startups  compaq differentiated its offerings from the many other ibm clones by not focusing mainly on price  but instead concentrating on new features  such as portability and better graphics displays as well as performance and all at prices comparable to those of ibm s pcs  in contrast to dell computer and gateway       compaq hired veteran engineers with an average of    years experience  which lent credibility to compaq s reputation of reliability among customers      due to its partnership with intel  compaq was able to maintain a technological lead in the market place as it was the first one to come out with the next generation of each intel processor      under canion s direction  compaq sold computers only through dealers to avoid potential competition that a direct sales channel would foster  which helped foster loyalty among resellers  by giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing compaq s offerings  either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales  dealers had a major incentive to advertise compaq         during its first year of sales  second year of operation   the company sold        pcs for sales of      million  the first start up to hit the      million mark that fast  compaq went public in      on the nyse and raised     million  in       it enjoyed record sales of      million from         pcs  and being the youngest ever firm to make the fortune      in       compaq hit the    billion revenue mark  taking the least amount of time to reach that milestone       by       compaq held the fifth place spot in the pc market with    billion in sales that year       two key marketing executives in compaq s early years  jim d arezzo and sparky sparks  had come from ibm s pc group  other key executives responsible for the company s meteoric growth in the late   s and early   s were ross a  cooley  another former ibm associate  who served for many years as svp of gm north america  michael swavely  who was the company s chief marketing officer in the early years  and eventually ran the north america organization  later passing along that responsibility to cooley when swavely retired  in the united states  brendan a   mac  mcloughlin  another long time ibm executive  led the company s field sales organization after starting up the western u s  area of operations  these executives  along with other key contributors  including kevin ellington  douglas johns  steven flannigan  and gary stimac  helped the company with the ibm corporation in all personal computer sales categories  after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth     the soft spoken canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped compaq to attract the best talent  instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper  canion chose a west coast style campus surrounded by forests  where every employee had similar offices and no one  not even the ceo  had a reserved parking spot  at semi annual meetings  turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers        in       company co founder bill murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the university of st  thomas  murto had helped to organize the company s marketing and authorized dealer distribution strategy  and held the post of senior vice president of sales since june       murto was succeeded by ross a  cooley  director of corporate sales  cooley would report to michael s  swavely  vice president for marketing  who has been given increased responsibility and the title of vice president for sales and marketing       in november      compaq announced their first product  the compaq portable  a portable ibm pc compatible personal computer  it was released in march      at        considerably more affordable than the canadian hyperion  the compaq portable was one of the progenitors of today s laptop  some called it a  suitcase computer  for its size and the look of its case  it was the second ibm pc compatible  being capable of running all software that would run on an ibm pc  it was a commercial success  selling        units in its first year and generating      million in sales revenue  the compaq portable was the first in the range of the compaq portable series  compaq was able to market a legal ibm clone because ibm mostly used  off the shelf  parts for their pc  furthermore  microsoft had kept the right to license the operating system to other computer manufacturers  the only part which had to be duplicated was the bios  which compaq did legally by using clean room reverse engineering at a cost of    million           unlike other companies  compaq did not bundle application software with its computers  vice president of sales and service h  l  sparks said in early            we ve considered it  and every time we consider it we reject it  i don t believe and our dealer network doesn t believe that bundling is the best way to merchandise those products     you remove the freedom from the dealers to really merchandise when you bundle in software  it is perceived by a lot of people as a marketing gimmick  you know  when you advertise a        computer with        worth of free software  it obviously can t be true     the software should stand on its merits and be supported and so should the hardware  why should you be constrained to use the software that comes with a piece of hardware  i think it can tend to inhibit sales over the long run     compaq instead emphasized pc compatibility  by october       when the company announced the compaq plus with a   mb hard drive  pc magazine wrote of  the reputation for compatibility it built with its highly regarded floppy disk portable     compaq computers remained the most compatible pc clones into         before clone bioses became available from phoenix technologies and other companies that also reverse engineered ibm s design  then sold their version to clone manufacturers     on june          compaq released the compaq deskpro  a    bit desktop computer using an intel      microprocessor running at     xa mhz  it was considerably faster than an ibm pc and was  like the compaq portable  also capable of running ibm software  it was compaq s first non portable computer and began the compaq deskpro line of computers     when compaq introduced the first pc based on intel s new       microprocessor  the compaq deskpro      in         it marked the first cpu change to the pc platform that was not initiated by ibm  an ibm made     machine eventually reached the market seven months later  but by that time compaq was the     supplier of choice and ibm had lost its image of technical leadership     for the first three months after announcement the deskpro     shipped with windows      this was a version of windows     adapted for the       processor  support for the virtual      mode was added by compaq engineers     compaq s technical leadership and the rivalry with ibm was emphasized when the systempro server was launched in late        this was a true server product with standard support for a second cpu and raid  but also the first product to feature the eisa bus  designed in reaction to ibm s mca  microchannel architecture  which was incompatible with the original at bus     although compaq had made its fortune by being     percent ibm compatible  it decided to continue with the original at bus instead of licensing ibm s mca  compaq s executives calculated that the     billion already spent by corporations on ibm compatible technology would make it difficult for even ibm to force manufacturers to adopt the new mca design  this was the right call as ibm s new mca was praised but failed to supplant the at bus  prior to developing eisa  compaq invested significant resources into reverse engineering mca  compaq shelved the idea of cloning mca and formed an alliance with hewlett packard and seven other major manufacturers  known collectively as the  gang of nine  to develop eisa       michael s  swavely  president of compaq s north american division since may       took a six month sabbatical in january       which would eventually become retirement effective on july            eckhard pfeiffer  then president of compaq international  was named to succeed him  pfeiffer also received the title of chief operating officer  with responsibility for the company s operations on a worldwide basis  so that canion could devote more time to strategy    swavely s abrupt departure in january led to rumors of turmoil in compaq s executive suite  including friction between canion and swavely  likely as swavely s rival pfeiffer had received the number two leadership position  swavely s u  s  marketing organization was losing ground with only    growth for compaq versus    in the market  likely due to short supplies of the lte    s from component shortages  rivals that undercut compaq s prices by as much as      and large customers who did not like compaq s dealer only policy    pfeiffer became president and ceo of compaq later that year  as a result of a boardroom coup led by board chairman ben rosen that forced co founder rod canion to resign as president and ceo       pfeiffer had joined compaq from texas instruments  and established operations from scratch in both europe and asia  pfeiffer was given         usd to start up compaq europe citation needed he started up compaq s first overseas office in munich in       by       compaq europe was a    billion business and number two behind ibm in that region  and foreign sales contributed    percent of compaq s revenues      pfeiffer  while transplanting compaq s u  s  strategy of dealer only distribution to europe  was more selective in signing up dealers than compaq had been in the u  s  such that european dealers were more qualified to handle its increasingly complex products       during the     s  under canion s direction compaq had focused on engineering  research  and quality control  producing high end high performance machines with high profit margins that allowed compaq to continue investing in engineering and next generation technology  this strategy was successful as compaq was considered a trusted brand while many other ibm clones were untrusted due to being plagued by poor reliability  however by the end of the eighties many manufacturers had improved their quality and were able to produce inexpensive pcs with off the shelf components  incurring none of the r d costs which allowed them to undercut compaq s expensive computers   faced with lower cost rivals such as dell computer  ast research  and gateway       compaq suffered a     million loss for that quarter  their first loss as a company  while the stock had dropped by over two thirds      an analyst stated that  compaq has made a lot of tactical errors in the last year and a half  they were trend setters  now they are lagging   canion initially believed that the     s recession was responsible for compaq s declining sales but insisted that they would recover once the economy improved  however pfeiffer s observation of the european market noted that it was competition as rivals could match compaq at a fraction of the cost  under pressure from compaq s board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their houston headquarters despite falling u s  sales  while the number of non u s  employees had stayed constant  compaq made its first ever layoffs       employees which was     of its workforce  while pfeiffer was promoted to evp and coo      rosen and canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper asian pc imports  as canion wanted compaq to build lower cost pcs with components developed in house in order to preserve compaq s reputation for engineering and quality  while rosen believed that compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster  while canion developed an    month plan to create a line of low priced computers  rosen sent his own compaq engineering team to comdex without canion s knowledge and discovered that a low priced pc could be made in half the time and at lower cost than canion s initiative     it was also believedby whom  that canion s consensus style management slowed the company s ability to react in the market  whereas pfeiffer s autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition citation needed    rosen initiated a    hour board meeting  and the directors also interviewed pfeiffer for several hours without informing canion  at the conclusion  the board was unanimous in picking pfeiffer over canion  as canion was popular with company workers      employees staged an impromptu protest with signs stating  we love you rod   and taking out a newspaper ad saying  rod  you are the wind beneath our wings  we love you     canion declined an offer to remain on compaq s board   and was bitter about his ouster as he didn t speak to rosen for years  although their relationship became cordial again  in       canion admitted that his ouster was justified  saying  i was burned out  i needed to leave  he rosen felt i didn t have a strong sense of urgency   two weeks after canion s ouster  five other senior executives resigned  including remaining company founder james c  harris as svp of engineering  these departures were motivated by an enhanced severance or early retirement  as well as an imminent demotion as their functions were to be shifted to vice presidents        under pfeiffer s tenure as chief executive  compaq entered the retail computer market with the presario which one of the first manufacturers in the mid     s to market a sub       pc  in order to maintain the prices it wanted  compaq became the first first tier computer manufacturer to utilize cpus from amd and cyrix  the two price wars resulting from compaq s actions ultimately drove numerous competitors from the market  such as packard bell and ast research  from third place in       compaq had overtaken apple computer and even surpassed ibm as the top pc manufacturer in       as both ibm and apple were struggling considerably during that time    compaq s inventory and gross margins were better than that of its rivals which enabled it to wage the price wars         compaq had decided to make a foray into printers in       and the first models were released to positive reviews in       however  pfeiffer saw that the prospects of taking on market leader hewlett packard  who had     market share  was tough  as that would force compaq to devote more funds and people to that project than originally budgeted  compaq ending up selling the printer business to xerox and took a charge of     million        on june           compaq reached an agreement with cisco systems inc  in order to get into networking  including digital modems  routers  and switches favored by small businesses and corporate departments  which was now a    billion business and the fastest growing part of the computer hardware market  compaq also built up a network engineering and marketing staff       in       despite record sales and profits at compaq  pfeiffer initiated a major management shakeup in the senior ranks    john t  rose  who previously ran compaq s desktop pc division  took over the corporate server business from svp gary stimac who had resigned  rose had joined compaq in      from digital equipment corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering  while stimac had been with compaq since      and was one of the longest serving executives  senior vice president for north america ross cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of       cfo daryl j  white  who joined the company in       resigned to run principal micro inc  michael winkler  who joined compaq in      to run its portable computer division  was promoted to general manager of the new pc products group      earl mason  hired from inland steel effective on may       immediately made an impact as the new cfo  under mason s guidance  compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits  which increased compaq s cash from      million to nearly    billion in one year  also compaq s return on invested capital  after tax operating profit divided by operating assets  has doubled to    percent from    percent in that period       compaq had been producing the pc chassis at its plant in shenzhen  china to cut costs  in       instead of expanding its own plant  compaq asked a taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals  with the taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached compaq in houston    pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy  to build pcs made to order which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks  with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software       vice president for corporate development kenneth e  kurtzman assembled five teams to examine compaq s businesses and assess each unit s strategy and that of key rivals  kurtzman s teams recommended to pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years or else compaq should exit that line  also  the company should no longer use profits from high margin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones  as instead each unit must show a return on investment    pfeiffer s vision was to make compaq a full fledged computer company  moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail pcs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that ibm did well at  such as computer servers which would also require more  customer handholding  from either the dealers or compaq staff themselves    unlike ibm and hp  compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers in house as these could be costly assets  instead compaq would leverage its partnerships  including these with andersen consulting and software maker sap  to install and maintain corporate systems  this allowed compaq to compete in the  big iron market  without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses       in january       compaq was at its height  ceo pfeiffer boldly predicted that the microsoft intel  wintel  duopoly would be replaced by  wintelpaq      pfeiffer also made several major  and some minor  acquisitions  in       compaq bought tandem computers  known for their nonstop server line citation needed this acquisition instantly gave compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market  minor acquisitions centered around building a networking arm and included networth        based in irving  texas and thomas conrad        based in austin  texas citation needed in      microcom was also acquired  based in norwood  ma  which brought a line of modems  remote access servers  ras  and the popular carbon copy software citation needed    in       compaq acquired digital equipment corporation for a then industry record of    billion usd  the merger made compaq  at the time  the world s second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind ibm    digital equipment  which had nearly twice as many employees as compaq while generating half the revenue  had been a leading computer company during the     s and early     s  however  digital had struggled during the     s  with high operating costs  for nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even  and had recently refocused itself as a  network solutions company   in       compaq had considered a bid for digital but only became seriously interested in      after digital s major divestments and refocusing on the internet  at the time of the acquisition  services accounted for    percent of digital s revenues  about    billion  and their gross margins on services averaged    percent  considerably higher than compaq s     margins on pc sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from compaq for years  compaq had originally wanted to purchase only digital s services business but that was turned down   when the announcement was made  it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave compaq a        person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases  by      services made up over     of compaq s revenues  largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger   in order to compete with ibm  however it was also risky merger  as the combined company would have to lay off       employees from compaq and        from digital which would potentially hurt morale  furthermore  compaq fell behind schedule in integrating digital s operations  which also distracted the company from its strength in low end pcs where it used to lead the market in rolling out next generation systems which let rival dell grab market share     reportedly compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate digital alone       however  pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do  or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity  and compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus  as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market    mark anderson  president of strategic news service  a research firm based in friday harbor  wash  was quoted as saying the kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders   like being a     billion company by the year       or to beat i b m    but they didn t have anything to do with customers  the new c e o  should look at everything eckhard acquired and ask  did the customer benefit from that  if the answer isn t yes  they should get rid of it  on one hand  compaq had previously dominated the pc market with its price war but was now struggling against dell  which sold directly to buyers  avoiding the dealer channel and its markup  and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum    at the same time  compaq  through its acquisitions of the digital equipment corporation last year and tandem computer in       had tried to become a major systems company  like ibm and hewlett packard  while ibm and hp were able generate repeat business from corporate customers to drive sales of their different divisions  compaq had not yet managed to make its newly acquired sales and services organizations work as seamlessly         in early       compaq had the problem of bloated pc inventories  by summer       compaq was suffering from product quality problems  robert w  stearns  svp of business development  said  in pfeiffer s quest for bigness  he lost an understanding of the customer and built what i call empty market share  large but not profitable   while jim moore  a technology strategy consultant with geopartners research in cambridge  mass   says pfeiffer  raced to scale without having economies of scale   the  colossus  that pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fast changing computer industry  that year compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many pcs  causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices  and since compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits       pfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor  rebuffing rosen s suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of compaq president  the board complained that pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rank and file  as he surrounded himself with a  clique  of chief financial officer earl mason  senior vice president john t  rose  and senior vice president of human resources hans gutsch  current and former compaq employees complained that gutsch was part of a group of senior executives  dubbed the  a team   who controlled access to pfeiffer  gutsch was said to be a  master of corporate politics  pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview   gutsch  who oversaw security  had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca    where the company s senior vice presidents worked    there were accusations that gutsch and others sought to divide top management  although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of tandem and digital equipment corp      pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks  saying  we cut the team down to the minimum number of people   those who would have to be directly involved  and not one person more   robert w  stearns  compaq s senior vice president for business development  with responsibility for mergers and acquisitions  had opposed the acquisition of digital as the cultural differences between both companies were too great  and complained that he was placed on the  b team  as a result       compaq entered      with strong expectations  fourth quarter      earnings reported in january      beat expectations by six cents a share with record    percent growth  the company launched compaq com as the key for its new direct sales strategy  and planned an ipo for altavista toward the end of      in order to capitalize on the dotcom bubble    however  by february       analysts were sceptical of compaq s plan to sell both direct and to resellers  compaq was hit with two class action lawsuits  as a result of cfo earl mason  svp john rose  and other executives selling     million usd of stock before a conference call with analysts  where they noted that demand for pcs was slowing down           on april           just nine days after compaq reported first quarter profit being at half of what analysts had expected  the latest in a string of earnings disappointments  pfeiffer was forced to resign as ceo in a coup led by board chairman ben rosen  reportedly  at the special board meeting held on april     the directors were unanimous in dismissing pfeiffer  the company s stock had fallen    percent since its all time high in january         compaq shares  which traded as high as        early in       dropped    percent on april     the first day of trading after the first quarter announcement and closed the following friday at           during three out of the last six quarters of pfeiffer s tenure  the company s revenues or earnings had missed expectations    while rival dell computer had     growth in u s  pc sales in the first quarter of       compaq could only manage              rosen suggested that the accelerating change brought about by the internet had overtaken compaq s management team  saying  as a company engaged in transforming its industry for the internet era  we must have the organizational flexibility necessary to move at internet speed   in a statement  pfeiffer said  compaq has come a long way since i joined the company in       and  under ben s guidance  i know this company will realize its potential     rosen s priority was to have compaq catchup as an e commerce competitor  and he also moved to streamline operations and reduce the indecision that plagued the company       roger kay  an analyst at international data corporation  observed that compaq s behavior at times seemed like a personal vendetta  noting that  eckhard has been so obsessed with staying ahead of dell that they focused too hard on market share and stopped paying attention to profitability and liquidity  they got whacked in a price war that they started     subsequent earnings releases from compaq s rivals  dell  gateway  ibm  and hewlett packard suggested that the problems were not affecting the whole pc industry as pfeiffer had suggested   dell and gateway sold direct  which helped them to avoid compaq s inventory problems and compete on price without dealer markups  plus gateway sold web access and a broad range of software tailored to small businesses  hewlett packard s pc business had similar challenges like compaq but this was offset by hp s extremely lucrative printer business  while ibm sold pcs at a loss but used them to lock in multi year services contracts with customers       after pfeiffer s resignation  the board established an office of the ceo with a triumvirate of directors  rosen as interim ceo and vice chairmen frank p  doyle and robert ted enloe iii    they began  cleaning house   as shortly afterward many of pfeiffer s top executives resigned or were pushed out  including john j  rando  earl l  mason  and john t  rose  rando  senior vice president and general manager of compaq services  was a key player during the merger discussions   and the most senior executive from digital to remain with compaq after the acquisition closed       and had been touted by some as the heir apparent to pfeiffer  rando s division had performed strongly as it had sales of      billion for the first quarter compared to      million in       which met expectations and was anticipated to post accelerated and profitable growth going forward  at the time of rando s departure  compaq services ranked third behind those of ibm and eds  while slightly ahead of hewlett packard s and andersen consulting  however customers switched from digital and tandem technology based workstations to those of hp  ibm  and sun microsystems    mason  senior vice president and chief financial officer  had previously been offered the job of chief executive of alliant foodservice  inc   a foodservice distributor based in chicago  and he informed compaq s board that he accepted the offer          rose  senior vice president and general manager of compaq s enterprise computing group  resigned effective as of june   and was succeeded by tandem veteran enrico pesatori  rose was reportedly upset that he was not considered for the ceo vacancy  which became apparent once michael capellas was named coo  while enterprise computing  responsible for engineering and marketing of network servers  workstations and data storage products  reportedly accounted for one third of compaq s revenues and likely the largest part of its profits  it was responsible for the earnings shortfall in q  of           in addition  rose was part of the  old guard  close to former ceo pfeiffer  and he and other compaq executives had been criticized at the company s annual meeting for selling stock before reporting the sales slowdown    capellas was appointed coo after pressure mounted on rosen to find a permanent ceo  however it was reported that potential candidates did not want to work under rosen as chairman       pfeiffer s permanent replacement was michael capellas  who had been serving as compaq s svp and cio for under a year  a couple months after pfeiffer s ouster  capellas was elevated to interim chief operating officer on june      and was soon appointed president and ceo  capellas also assumed the title of chairman on september          when rosen stepped down from the board of directors   at his retirement  rosen proclaimed  these are great achievements to create        jobs      billion in sales and     billion in market value  all starting with a sketch and a dream        capellas was able to restore some of the luster lost in the latter part of the pfeiffer era and he repaired the relationship with microsoft which had deteriorated under his predecessor s tenure       however compaq still struggled against lower cost competitors with direct sales channels such as dell who took over the top spot of pc manufacturer from compaq in         compaq relied significantly on reseller channels  so their criticism caused compaq to retreat from its proposed direct sales plan  although capellas maintained that he would use the middlemen to provide value added services    despite falling to no    among pc manufacturers  capellas proclaimed  we are no    in the traditional pc market  but we re focused on industry leadership in the next generation of internet access devices and wireless mobility  that s where the growth and the profitability will be   the company s longer term strategy involves extending its services to servers and storage products  as well as handheld computers such as the ipaq pocketpc which accounted for    percent of total unit volume        during november       compaq began to work with microsoft to create the first in a line of small scale  web based computer systems called msn companions       in       compaq also signed new sales and equipment alliance with navisite  under the pact  compaq agreed to promote and sell navisite web hosting services  in return  navisite took compaq as a preferred provider for its storage and intel based servers     compaq struggled as a result of the collapse of the dot com bubble bust  which hurt sales of their high end systems in      and       and they managed only a small profit in a few quarters during these years  they also accumulated      billion in short term debt around this time    the stock price of compaq  which was around     when capellas became ceo  was trading at half that by            in       compaq signed a merger agreement with hewlett packard for       billion  including        billion for goodwill  where each compaq share would be exchanged for        of a hewlett packard share  there would be a termination fee of      million usd that either company would have to pay the other to break the merger    compaq shareholders would own     of the combined company while hp s would have        hewlett packard had reported yearly revenues of     billion  while compaq s was     billion  and the combined company would have been close to ibm s     billion revenues  it was projected to have      billion in annual cost savings by mid       the expected layoffs at compaq and hp       and      jobs  respectively  would leave the combined company with a workforce of               both companies had to seek approval from their shareholders through separate special meetings  while compaq shareholders unanimously approved the deal  there was a public proxy battle within hp as the deal was strongly opposed by numerous large hp shareholders  including the sons of the company founders  walter hewlett and david w  packard  as well as the california public employees  retirement system  calpers  and the ontario teachers pension plan      walter hewlett only relunctantly approved the merger  in his duty as a member of the board of directors  since the merger agreement  called for unanimous board approval in order to ensure the best possible shareholder reception     while supporters of the merger argued that there would be economies of scale and that the sales of pcs would drive sales of printers and cameras  walter hewlett was convinced that pcs were a low margin but risky business that would not contribute and would likely dilute the old hp s traditionally profitable imaging and printing division      david w  packard in his opposition to the deal  cited massive layoffs as an example of this departure from hp s core values   arguing that although the founders never guaranteed job security   bill and dave never developed a premeditated business strategy that treated hp employees as expendable    packard further stated that  fiorina s high handed management and her efforts to reinvent the company ran counter to the company s core values as established by the founders   the founders  families who controlled a significant amount of hp shares were further irked because fiorina had made no attempt to reach out to them and consult about the merger  instead they received the standard roadshow presentation as other investors       analysts on wall street were generally critical of the merger  as both companies had been struggling before the announcement  and the stock prices of both companies dropped in the months after the merger agreement was made public  particularly rival dell made gains from defecting hp and compaq customers who were wary of the merger    carly fiorina  initially seen as hp s savior when she was hired as ceo back in       had seen the company s stock price drop to less than half since she assumed the position  and her job was said to be on shaky ground before the merger announcement    hp s offer was regarded by analysts to be overvaluing compaq  due to compaq s shaky financial performance in the past recent years  there were rumors that it could run out of money in    months and be forced to cease business operations had it stayed independent   as well as compaq s own more conservative valuation of its assets        detractors of the deal noted that buying compaq was a  distraction  that would not directly help hp take on ibm s breadth or dell computer s direct sales model  plus there were significant cultural differences between hp and compaq  which made decisions by consensus and rapid autocratic styles  respectively  one of compaq s few bright spots was its services business  which was outperforming hp s own services division       the merger was approved by hp shareholders only after the narrowest of margins clarification needed and allegations of vote buying  primarily involving an alleged last second back room deal with deutsche bank  haunted the new company  it was subsequently disclosed that hp had retained deutsche bank s investment banking division in january      to assist in the merger  hp had agreed to pay deutsche bank    million guaranteed  and another    million contingent upon approval of the merger  on august           the u s  sec charged deutsche bank with failing to disclose a material conflict of interest in its voting of client proxies for the merger and imposed a civil penalty of           deutsche bank consented without admitting or denying the findings       compaq s pre merger ticker symbol was cpq  this was combined with hewlett packard s ticker symbol  hwp  to create the current ticker symbol  hpq      capellas  compaq s last chairman and ceo  became president of the post merger hewlett packard  under chairman and ceo carly fiorina  to ease the integration of the two companies  however  capellas was reported not to be happy with his role  being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become ceo as the board supported fiorina  capellas stepped down on november           just six months on the job  to become ceo of mci worldcom where he would lead its acquisition by verizon  capella s former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the ceo         fiorina helmed hp for nearly three years after capellas left  hp laid off thousands of former compaq  dec  hp  and tandem employees      its stock price generally declined and profits did not perk up  several senior executives from the compaq side including jeff clarke and peter blackmore would resign or be ousted from the post merger hp  though the combination of both companies  pc manufacturing capacity initially made it the number one  it soon lost the lead and further market share to dell which squeezed hp on low end pcs      hp was also unable to compete effectively with ibm in the high end server market  in addition  the merging of the stagnant compaq computer assembly business with hp s lucrative printing and imaging division was criticized for obstructing the profitability of the printing imaging segment    overall  it has been suggested that the purchase of compaq was not a good move for hp  due to the narrow profit margins in the commoditized pc business  especially in light of ibm s      announcement to sell its pc division to lenovo  the inquirer noted that the continued low return on investment and small margins of hp s personal computer manufacturing business  now named the personal systems group   continues to be what it was in the individual companies  not much more than a job creation scheme for its employees        in february       the board of directors ousted fiorina      former compaq ceo capellas was mentioned by some as a potential successor  but several months afterwards  mark hurd was hired as president and ceo of hp  hurd separated the pc division from the imaging and printing division and renamed it the personal systems group  placing it under the leadership of evp todd r  bradley  hewlett packard s pc business has since been reinvigorated by hurd s restructuring and now generates more revenue than the traditionally more profitable printers  by late       hp had retaken the    sales position of pcs from dell  which struggled with missed estimates and poor quality  and has held that rank ever since     most compaq products have been re branded with the hp nameplate  such as the company s market leading proliant server line  while the compaq brand remains on only some consumer oriented and budget products  notably compaq presario pcs  hp s business computers line was discontinued in favour of the compaq evo line  which was rebranded hp compaq  hp s jornada pdas were replaced by compaq ipaq pdas  which were renamed hp ipaq  all compaq computers now ship with hp software     in may       hp announced in a press release a new logo for their compaq division to be placed on the new model compaq presarios       in       hp reshuffled its business line notebooks  the  compaq  name from its  hp compaq  series was originally used for all of hp s business and budget notebooks  however  the hp elitebook line became the top of the business notebook lineup while the hp compaq b series became its middle business line    as of early       the  hp probook  filled out hp s low end business lineup       in       hp sold part of compaq s former headquarters to the lone star college system       in       the last compaq presario branded laptop was produced at an hp computer assembly facility in china  since then  the presario was rebranded under hp s laptop computer line as the hp      series citation needed    on august           then ceo of hp leo apotheker announced plans for a partial or full spinoff of the personal systems group  the pc unit had the lowest profit margin although it accounted for nearly a third of hp s overall revenues in       hp was still selling more pcs than any other vendor  shipping      million pcs in the second quarter of             of the market according to gartner   while dell and lenovo were tied for second place  each with more than a     share of the market and shipments of over    million units       however  the announcement of the pc spinoff  concurrent with the discontinuation of webos  and the purchase of autonomy corp  for     billion  was poorly received by the market  and after apotheker s ouster  plans for a divestiture were cancelled      in march       the printing and imaging division was merged into the pc unit    in in october       according to gartner  lenovo took the lead as the number one pc manufacturer from hp  while idc ranked lenovo just right behind hp    in q        forbes reported that lenovo ranked ahead of hp as the world s number one pc supplier       compaq world headquarters  now hp united states  campus consisted of    acres         xa m   of land which contained    office buildings    manufacturing buildings  a product conference center  an employee cafeteria  mechanical laboratories  warehouses  and chemical handling facilities         instead of headquartering the company in a downtown houston skyscraper  then ceo rod canion chose a west coast style campus surrounded by forests  where every employee had similar offices and no one  not even the ceo  had a reserved parking spot     as it grew  compaq became so important to houston that it may have caused the construction of highway     in the late     s  and many other technology companies appeared in what became known as the      corridor        senior vice president of human resources  hans w  gutsch  oversaw the company s facilities and security  gutsch had an had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of cca    where the company s senior vice presidents had their offices  eckhard pfeiffer  president and ceo  introduced a whole series of executive perks to a company that had always had an egalitarian culture  for instance he oversaw the construction of an executive parking garage  previously parking places had never been reserved           on august           the compaq commons was opened in the headquarters campus  which featured a conference center  an employee convenience store  a wellness center  and an employee cafeteria        in       hp sold part of compaq s former headquarters to the lone star college system    hewlett packard buildings          two eight story reinforced concrete buildings totaling         square feet  plus a       car parking garage and a central chiller plant  were all deemed by the college to be too robust and costly to maintain so they were demolished by implosion on september                          as of january     update the site is one of hp s largest campuses  with       employees in all six of hp s divisions       compaq originally competed directly against ibm  manufacturing computer systems equivalent with the ibm pc  as well as apple computer  in the     s  as ibm s own pc division declined  compaq faced other ibm pc compatible manufacturers like dell computer  packard bell  ast research  and gateway          by the mid     s  compaq s price war had enabled it to overtake ibm and apple  while other ibm pc compatible manufacturers such as packard bell and ast were driven from the market     dell became the number one supplier of pcs in          at the time of their      merger  compaq and hp were the second and third largest pc manufacturers  so their combination made them number one  however  the combined hp compaq struggled and fell to second place behind dell from            due to dell s struggles in late       hp has led all pc vendors since      onwards     during its existence as a division of hp  compaq primarily competed against other budget oriented personal computer series from manufacturers including acer  lenovo  and toshiba     before its merger with hp  compaq sponsored the williams formula one team when it was still powered by bmw engines  hp inherited and continued the sponsorship deal for a few years
