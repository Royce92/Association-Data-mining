 fujitsu cloud iaas trusted public s  is a fujitsu cloud computing platform that aims to deliver standardized enterprise class public cloud services globally   it offers infrastructure as a service  iaas  from fujitsu s data centers to provide computing resources that can be employed on demand and suited to customers  needs  the service ensures a high level of reliability that is sufficient for deployment in mission critical systems     in japan  the service was offered as the on demand virtual system service  oviss  and was then launched globally as fujitsu global cloud platform s   fgcp s    since july      the service has been called iaas trusted public s    globally  the service is operated from fujitsu data centers located in australia  singapore  the united states  the united kingdom and germany     fujitsu has also launched a windows azure powered global cloud platform  in a partnership with microsoft  this is a platform as a service  paas  offering that was known as fgcp a  in japan but has since been renamed fujitsu cloud paas a  for windows azure   it is operated from a fujitsu data center in japan  it offers a set of application development frameworks  such as microsoft  net  java and php  and data storage capabilities consistent with the windows azure platform provided by microsoft  the basic service consists of compute  storage  microsoft sql azure  and windows azure appfabric technologies such as service bus and access control service  with options for interoperating services covering implementation and migration of applications  system building  systems operation  and support             fujitsu launched its global cloud strategy in april        provision of services from this platform was offered on a trial basis to     companies in japan from the following month   fujitsu announced general availability of the iaas service in japan  under the name on demand virtual system service  oviss   starting on   october       as part of the service s global rollout  it was launched in australia under the name fujitsu global cloud platform  fgcp  in february        this was followed by launches in march      in singapore and in may      in the united kingdom   germany  and the united states of america    in july       fujitsu added a center in western japan to bring the total number to seven    in july      fujitsu announced the fujitsu cloud initiative globally which also announced the new name as fujitsu cloud iaas trusted public s       the basic component in the iaas trusted public s  is called a virtual system  it consists of a firewall and one or multiple network segments in which customers can host their virtual machines  once signed up  customers can deploy multiple systems within their environment  much like a virtual data center     iaas trusted public s  employs templates to allow customers to quickly deploy virtual systems  a template consists of a firewall  network segment definitions and virtual servers with os middleware installed and set up  this allows quick selection of for example a system of three network zones  with pre installed a web server in the dmz  an application server in the secure zone and a database in another secure zone  a virtual system includes a firewall to control access between the network segments and from and to the internet and intranet  the intranet connection is for communication between the virtual servers and customers  existing servers hosted in the same fujitsu data center     virtual servers are chosen from a list of pre defined images  which have only an operating system installed or also additional software     servers with different computational resources are offered     operating systems offered globally include windows server       windows server       red hat enterprise linux  centos   and ubuntu       fujitsu has claimed that licensing is the only issue that prevents delivery of microsoft office as a cloud service to web based devices  in a manner similar to google docs       a virtual server has a system disk of a pre defined size  additional disks  with sizes configurable from    gb to    tb  can be attached to a server when it is not running     customers can provision global ip addresses and assign them to virtual servers  this is similar to amazon s elastic ip address feature     users provision and manage their virtual systems through a self service portal  it can also be used to initiate a vpn connection to a virtual zone     all operations offered through the service portal are also offered through a cloud api  the api is xml rpc based  using ssl to encrypt its messages and certificates for authentication  operations are also possible through multi cloud api apache deltacloud     fujitsu has submitted their cloud api specification to the distributed management task force s open cloud standards incubator to promote open standards for cloud interoperability    and contributed to the dmtf s cloud infrastructure management interface  cimi  standard    in july      fujitsu demonstrated a client using cimi to manage a system in iaas trusted public s  at a management developers conference       servers are physically located in fujitsu s tier iii data centers  in japan  australia  singapore  uk  us and germany
