 the north american electric reliability corporation  nerc  is a nonprofit corporation based in atlanta  georgia  and formed on march           as the successor to the north american electric reliability council  also known as nerc   the original nerc was formed on june          by the electric utility industry to promote the reliability and adequacy of bulk power transmission in the electric utility systems of north america  nerc s mission states that it is to  ensure the reliability of the north american bulk power system       nerc oversees eight regional reliability entities and encompasses all of the interconnected power systems of the contiguous united states  canada and a portion of baja california in mexico     nerc s major responsibilities include working with all stakeholders to develop standards for power system operation  monitoring and enforcing compliance with those standards  assessing resource adequacy  and providing educational and training resources as part of an accreditation program to ensure power system operators remain qualified and proficient  nerc also investigates and analyzes the causes of significant power system disturbances in order to help prevent future events     nerc also provides for critical infrastructure protection  nerc cip              early electric power systems  such as those installed by george westinghouse and thomas edison  prior to the start of the   th century were isolated central stations which served small pockets of customers independently of each other  as some of these power systems grew to cover larger geographic areas  it became possible to connect previously isolated systems  this allowed neighboring systems to share generation and voltage stability resources  providing mutual benefit to each side  however  tying power systems together with these early interconnections also introduced the risk that a single significant disturbance could collapse all of the systems tied to the interconnection  generally it was decided that the benefits outweighed the risks  and by      interconnections began to flourish and grow in size  by the end of the     s there were virtually no isolated power systems remaining in the lower forty eight states and southern canada  practically all power companies were attached to large interconnections     in       when the eastern interconnection was established in its current form  the interconnected systems group  composed of southern and midwestern utility companies   the pjm interconnection  and the canada united states eastern interconnection  canuse  formed the interconnection coordination committee to recommend an informal operations structure  which led to the formation of the north american power systems interconnection committee  napsic   napsic eventually grew to also include the texas interconnection and most of the companies in what is today the western electricity coordinating council  wecc   operating within the western interconnection     on november          a relatively minor system disturbance triggered a power system protection component that was not properly configured  the interconnection was operating near peak capacity due to the extreme cold weather and high heating demand  and was therefore more vulnerable than usual  the small initial outage quickly cascaded into the northeast blackout of       this disturbance revealed the extent that interconnections had evolved without adequate high level planning and operating oversight to try to prevent such events  and that interconnected power systems frequently had varying operating standards and procedures developed somewhat independently by each member on the interconnection  restoration efforts were also partially hampered due to the lack of common practices and coordination procedures  furthermore  power system protection schemes were often designed with only a local power system s design in mind  meaning that they might misoperate in response to protection schemes activating in neighboring systems  this disturbance revealed the necessity to develop common operating and protection standards as well as plans to effectively coordinate power system restoration efforts     the electric reliability act of      proposed the creation of a council on power coordination  although not enacted  the proposed legislation stimulated the development of an industry reliability council  the federal power commission  predecessor of the federal energy regulatory commission  recommended the formation of a council on power coordination made up of representatives from each of the nation s regional coordinating organizations  to exchange and disseminate information and to review  discuss and assist in resolving interregional coordination matters     the north american electric reliability council  nerc  was established by the electric utility industry  in response to the      blackout  nine regional reliability organizations were formalized under nerc  also formalized were regional planning coordination guides  which nerc maintained  napsic operations criteria and guides continued to be maintained and practiced voluntarily     although significant disturbances continued to occasionally occur  such as the new york city blackout of       nerc undoubtedly played a significant role in minimizing the impact and frequency of these events  it is difficult to quantify this success because it is impossible to know how many disturbances were prevented by the influence of nerc and the reliability councils     out of its long history  nerc developed a complex committee structure which brings together hundreds of industry expert volunteers in nearly    committees  sub committees  task forces  and working groups considering issues from wind and renewable power integration to education to demand side management and energy efficiency  nerc s role in raising awareness of reliability issues and creating the impetus to address them is intended to improve reliability every day     with the passage of the energy policy act of       an electric reliability organization  ero  was created to develop and enforce compliance with mandatory reliability standards in the u s  this non governmental   self regulatory organization  was created in recognition of the interconnected and international nature of the bulk power grid  in       nerc applied for and was granted this designation     today  nerc s standards are mandatory and enforceable throughout the united states and several provinces in canada  electric utilities and or energy concerns in the states of alaska  hawaii  the dominion of puerto rico  and the territories of american samoa  guam  and the virgin islands are not under reliability oversight by nerc   entities in the u s  found to be in violation of a standard can be subject to fines of up to    million per day per violation     as part of the fallout of the northeast blackout of       the energy policy act of      authorized the federal energy regulatory commission  ferc  to designate a national electric reliability organization  ero   on july           ferc issued an order certifying nerc as the ero for the united states  prior to being the national ero  nerc s guidelines for power system operation and accreditation were referred to as policies  for which compliance was strongly encouraged yet ultimately voluntary  nerc has worked with all stakeholders over the past several years to revise its policies into standards  and now has authority to enforce those standards on power system entities operating in the united states  as well as several provinces in canada  by way of significant financial penalties for noncompliance  efforts between nerc and the canadian and mexican governments are underway to obtain comparable authority for nerc to enforce its standards on the nerc member systems residing outside of the united states     in april       nerc issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyberwarfare
