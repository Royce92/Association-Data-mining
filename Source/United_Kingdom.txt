beginning in    ad  and the     year rule of southern britain  was followed by an invasion by germanic anglo saxon settlers  reducing the brythonic area mainly to what was to become wales and the historic kingdom of strathclyde    most of the region settled by the anglo saxons became unified as the kingdom of england in the   th century    meanwhile  gaelic speakers in north west britain  with connections to the north east of ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from there in the  th century      united with the picts to create the kingdom of scotland in the  th century

feudalism on the northern french model and norman french culture    the norman elites greatly influenced  but eventually assimilated with  each of the local cultures    subsequent medieval english kings completed the conquest of wales and made an unsuccessful attempt to annex scotland  following the declaration of arbroath  scotland maintained its independence  albeit in near constant conflict with england  the english monarchs  through inheritance of substantial territories in france and claims to the french crown  were also heavily involved in conflicts in france  most notably the hundred years war  while the kings of scots were in an alliance with the french during this period       the early modern period saw religious conflict resulting from the reformation and the introduction of protestant state churches in each country    wales was fully incorporated into the kingdom of england    and ireland was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the english crown    in what was to become northern ireland  the lands of the independent catholic gaelic nobility were confiscated and given to protestant settlers from england and scotland       in       the kingdoms of england  scotland and ireland were united in a personal union when james vi  king of scots  inherited the crowns of england and ireland and moved his court from edinburgh to london  each country nevertheless remained a separate political entity and retained its separate political  legal  and religious institutions         in the mid   th century  all three kingdoms were involved in a series of connected wars  including the english civil war  which led to the temporary overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the short lived unitary republic of the commonwealth of england  scotland and ireland         although the monarchy was restored  it ensured  with the glorious revolution of      and the subsequent bill of rights       and the claim of right act       that  unlike much of the rest of europe  royal absolutism would not prevail  and a professed catholic could never accede to the throne  the british constitution would develop on the basis of constitutional monarchy and the parliamentary system    with the constitutional rights of parliament legally established  no monarch has since entered the house of commons when it is sitting meeting  which is annually commemorated at the state opening of parliament by the british monarch when the doors of the house of commons are slammed in the face of the monarch s messenger  symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch      with the founding of the royal society in       science was greatly encouraged  during this period  particularly in england  the development of naval power  and the interest in voyages of discovery  led to the acquisition and settlement of overseas colonies  particularly in north america         on   may       the united kingdom of great britain came into being  the result of acts of union being passed by the parliaments of england and scotland to ratify the      treaty of union and so unite the two kingdoms           in the   th century  cabinet government developed under robert walpole  in practice the first prime minister              a series of jacobite uprisings sought to remove the protestant house of hanover from the british throne and restore the catholic house of stuart  the jacobites were finally defeated at the battle of culloden in       after which the scottish highlanders were brutally suppressed  the british colonies in north america that broke away from britain in the american war of independence became the united states of america in       british imperial ambition turned elsewhere  particularly to india       during the   th century  britain was involved in the atlantic slave trade  british ships transported an estimated   million slaves from africa to the west indies before banning the trade in      and taking a leading role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide by pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of treaties  and then formed the world s oldest international human rights organisation  anti slavery international  in london in             the term  united kingdom  became official in      when the parliaments of britain and ireland each passed an act of union  uniting the two kingdoms and creating the united kingdom of great britain and ireland       in the early   th century  the british led industrial revolution began to transform the country  it slowly led to a shift in political power away from the old tory and whig landowning classes towards the new industrialists  an alliance of merchants and industrialists with the whigs would lead to a new party  the liberals  with an ideology of free trade and laissez faire  in      parliament passed the great reform act  which began the transfer of political power from the aristocracy to the middle classes  in the countryside  enclosure of the land was driving small farmers out  towns and cities began to swell with a new urban working class  few ordinary workers had the vote  and they created their own organisations in the form of trade unions     after the defeat of france in the revolutionary and napoleonic wars              the uk emerged as the principal naval and imperial power of the   th century  with london the largest city in the world from about          unchallenged at sea  british dominance was later described as pax britannica      by the time of the great exhibition of       britain was described as the  workshop of the world     the british empire was expanded to include india  large parts of africa and many other territories throughout the world  alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies  british dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries  such as china  argentina and siam      domestically  political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise  during the century  the population increased at a dramatic rate  accompanied by rapid urbanisation  causing significant social and economic stresses    after       the uk s industrial monopoly was challenged by germany and the usa  to seek new markets and sources of raw materials  the conservative party under disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in egypt  south africa and elsewhere  canada  australia and new zealand became self governing dominions       social reform and home rule for ireland were important domestic issues after       the labour party emerged from an alliance of trade unions and small socialist groups in       and suffragettes campaigned for women s right to vote before          the uk fought with france  russia and  after       the us  against germany and its allies in world war i              the uk armed forces were engaged across much of the british empire and in several regions of europe  particularly on the western front    the high fatalities of trench warfare caused the loss of much of a generation of men  with lasting social effects in the nation and a great disruption in the social order     after the war  the uk received the league of nations mandate over a number of former german and ottoman colonies  the british empire reached its greatest extent  covering a fifth of the world s land surface and a quarter of its population    however  the uk had suffered     million casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt    the rise of irish nationalism and disputes within ireland over the terms of irish home rule led eventually to the partition of the island in         and the irish free state became independent with dominion status in       northern ireland remained part of the united kingdom    a wave of strikes in the mid     s culminated in the uk general strike of       the uk had still not recovered from the effects of the war when the great depression           occurred  this led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old industrial areas  as well as political and social unrest in the     s  a coalition government was formed in            the uk entered world war ii by declaring war on germany in       after it had invaded poland and czechoslovakia  in       winston churchill became prime minister and head of a coalition government  despite the defeat of its european allies in the first year of the war  the uk continued the fight alone against germany  in       the raf defeated the german luftwaffe in a struggle for control of the skies in the battle of britain  the uk suffered heavy bombing during the blitz  there were also eventual hard fought victories in the battle of the atlantic  the north africa campaign and burma campaign  uk forces played an important role in the normandy landings of       achieved with its ally the us  after germany s defeat  the uk was one of the big three powers who met to plan the post war world  it was an original signatory to the declaration of the united nations  the uk became one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council  however  the war left the uk severely weakened and depending financially on marshall aid and loans from the united states       in the immediate post war years  the labour government initiated a radical programme of reforms  which had a significant effect on british society in the following decades    major industries and public utilities were nationalised  a welfare state was established  and a comprehensive  publicly funded healthcare system  the national health service  was created    the rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with britain s now much diminished economic position  so that a policy of decolonisation was unavoidable  independence was granted to india and pakistan in          over the next three decades  most colonies of the british empire gained their independence  many became members of the commonwealth of nations        although the uk was the third country to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal  with its first atomic bomb test in        the new post war limits of britain s international role were illustrated by the suez crisis of       the international spread of the english language ensured the continuing international influence of its literature and culture  from the     s onward  its popular culture was also influential abroad  as a result of a shortage of workers in the     s  the uk government encouraged immigration from commonwealth countries  in the following decades  the uk became a multi ethnic society     despite rising living standards in the late     s and     s  the uk s economic performance was not as successful as many of its competitors  such as west germany and japan  in       the uk joined the european economic community  eec   and when the eec became the european union  eu  in       it was one of the    founding members     from the late     s  northern ireland suffered communal and paramilitary violence  sometimes affecting other parts of the uk  conventionally known as the troubles  it is usually considered to have ended with the belfast  good friday  agreement of                   following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife in the     s  the conservative government of the     s initiated a radical policy of monetarism  deregulation  particularly of the financial sector  for example  big bang in       and labour markets  the sale of state owned companies  privatisation   and the withdrawal of subsidies to others     this resulted in high unemployment and social unrest  but ultimately also economic growth  particularly in the services sector  from       the economy was helped by the inflow of substantial north sea oil revenues        around the end of the   th century there were major changes to the governance of the uk with the establishment of devolved administrations for scotland  wales and northern ireland       the statutory incorporation followed acceptance of the european convention on human rights  the uk is still a key global player diplomatically and militarily  it plays leading roles in the eu  un and nato  however  controversy surrounds some of britain s overseas military deployments  particularly in afghanistan and iraq        the      global financial crisis severely affected the uk economy  the coalition government of      introduced austerity measures intended to tackle the substantial public deficits which resulted     in      the scottish government held a referendum on scottish independence  with     of voters rejecting the independence proposal and opting to remain within the united kingdom        the total area of the united kingdom is approximately         square kilometres        xa sqxa mi   the country occupies the

predominantly west and north of the mainland  notably the hebrides  orkney islands and shetland islands  the topography of scotland is distinguished by the highland boundary faultxa   a geological rock fracturexa   which traverses scotland from arran in the west to stonehaven in the east     the faultline separates two distinctively different regions  namely the highlands to the north and west and the lowlands to the south and east  the more rugged highland region contains the majority of scotland s mountainous land  including ben nevis which at       metres       xa ft  is the highest point in the british isles     lowland areasxa   especially the narrow waist of land between the firth of clyde and the firth of forth known as the central beltxa   are flatter and home to most of the

plentiful rainfall all year round     the temperature varies with the seasons seldom dropping below    xa  c    xa  f  or rising above   xa  c    xa  f      the prevailing wind is from the south west and bears frequent spells of mild and wet weather from the atlantic ocean     although the eastern parts are mostly sheltered from this wind since the majority of the rain falls over the western regions the eastern parts are therefore the driest  atlantic currents  warmed by the gulf stream  bring mild winters     especially in the west where winters are wet and even more so over high ground  summers are warmest in the south east of england  being closest to the european mainland  and coolest in the north  heavy snowfall can occur in winter and early spring on high ground  and occasionally settles to great depth away from the hills     each country of the united kingdom has its own system of administrative and geographic demarcation  whose origins often pre date the formation of the united kingdom  thus there is  no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the united kingdom      until the   th century there was little change to those arrangements  but there has since been a constant evolution of role and function     change did not occur in a uniform manner and the devolution of power over local government to scotland  wales and northern ireland means that future changes are also unlikely to be uniform     the organisation of local government in england is complex  with the distribution of functions varying according to local arrangements  legislation concerning local government in england is the responsibility of the uk parliament and the government of the united kingdom  as england has no devolved parliament  the upper tier subdivisions of england are the nine government office regions or european union government office regions     one region  greater london  has had a directly elected assembly and mayor since      following popular support for the proposal in a referendum     it was intended that other regions would also be given their own elected regional assemblies  but a proposed assembly in the north east region was rejected by a referendum in          below the regional tier  some parts of england have county councils and district councils and others have unitary authorities  while london consists of    london boroughs and the city of london  councillors are elected by the first past the post system in single member wards or by the multi member plurality system in multi member wards        for local government purposes  scotland is divided into    council areas  with wide variation in both size and population  the cities of glasgow  edinburgh  aberdeen and dundee are separate council areas  as is the highland council which includes a third of scotland s area but only just over        xa people  local councils are made up of elected councillors  of whom there are currently           they are paid a part time salary  elections are conducted by single transferable vote in multi member wards that elect either three or four councillors  each council elects a provost  or convenor  to chair meetings of the council and to act as a figurehead for the area  councillors are subject to a code of conduct enforced by the standards commission for scotland     the representative association of scotland s

islands of jersey and guernsey in the english channel  and the isle of man in the irish sea  by mutual agreement  the british government manages the islands  foreign affairs and defence and the uk parliament has the authority to legislate on their behalf  however  internationally  they are regarded as  territories for which the united kingdom is responsible      the power to pass legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own respective legislative assemblies  with the assent of the crown  privy council or  in the case of the isle of man  in certain circumstances the lieutenant governor      since      each crown dependency has had a chief minister as its head of government        the united kingdom is a unitary state under a constitutional monarchy  queen elizabeth ii is the head of state of the uk as well as monarch of fifteen other independent commonwealth countries  the monarch has  the right to be consulted  the right to encourage  and the right to

disparate written sources  including statutes  judge made case law and international treaties  together with constitutional conventions  as there is no technical difference between ordinary statutes and  constitutional law   the uk parliament can perform  constitutional reform  simply by passing acts of parliament  and thus has the political power to change or abolish almost any written or unwritten element of the constitution  however  no parliament can pass laws that future parliaments cannot change        the uk has a parliamentary government based on the westminster system that has been emulated around the world  a legacy of the british empire  the parliament of the united kingdom meets in the palace of westminster and has two houses  an elected house of commons and an appointed

general election these three parties together won     out of     seats in the house of commons        most of the remaining seats were won by parties that contest elections only in one part of the uk  the scottish national party  scotland only   plaid cymru  wales only   and the alliance party  democratic unionist party  social democratic and labour party and sinn f in  northern ireland onlynb      in accordance with party policy  no elected sinn f in members of parliament have ever attended the house of commons to speak on behalf of their constituents because of the requirement to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch     scotland  wales and northern ireland each have their own government or executive  led by a first minister  or  in the case of northern ireland  a diarchal first minister and deputy first minister   and a devolved unicameral legislature  england  the largest country of the united kingdom  has no such devolved executive or legislature and is administered and legislated for directly by the uk government and parliament on all issues  this situation has given rise to the so called west lothian question which concerns the fact that members of parliament from scotland  wales and northern ireland can vote  sometimes decisively     on matters that only affect england     the mckay commission reported on this matter in march      recommending that laws affecting only england should need support from a majority of english members of parliament        the scottish government and parliament have wide ranging powers over any matter that has not been specifically reserved to the uk parliament  including education  healthcare  scots law and local government     at the      elections the scottish national party won re election and achieved an overall majority in the scottish parliament  with its leader  alex salmond  as first minister of scotland        in       the uk and scottish governments signed the edinburgh agreement setting out the terms for a referendum on scottish independence in       which was defeated     to         the welsh government and the national assembly for wales have more limited powers than those devolved to scotland     the assembly is able to legislate on devolved matters through acts of the assembly  which require no prior consent from westminster  the      elections resulted in a minority labour administration led by carwyn jones        the northern ireland executive and assembly have powers similar to those devolved to scotland  the executive is led by a diarchy representing unionist and nationalist members of the assembly  currently  peter robinson  democratic unionist party  and martin mcguinness  sinn f in  are first minister and deputy first minister respectively     devolution to northern ireland is contingent on participation by the northern ireland administration in the north south ministerial council  where the northern ireland executive cooperates and develops joint and shared policies with the government of ireland  the british and irish governments co operate on non devolved matters affecting northern ireland through the british irish intergovernmental conference  which assumes the responsibilities of the northern ireland administration in the event of its non operation     the uk does not have a codified constitution and constitutional matters are not among the powers devolved to scotland  wales or northern ireland  under the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty  the uk parliament could  in theory  therefore  abolish the scottish parliament  welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly        indeed  in       the uk parliament unilaterally prorogued the parliament of northern ireland  setting a precedent relevant to contemporary devolved institutions     in practice  it would be politically difficult for the uk parliament to abolish devolution to the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly  given the political entrenchment created by referendum decisions     the political constraints placed upon the uk parliament s power to interfere with devolution in northern ireland are even greater than in relation to scotland and wales  given that devolution in northern ireland rests upon an international agreement with the government of ireland        the united kingdom does not have a single legal system  as article    of the      treaty of union provided for the continuation of scotland s separate legal system     today the uk has three distinct systems of law  english law  northern ireland law and scots law  a new supreme court of the united kingdom came into being in october      to replace the appellate committee of the house of lords        the judicial committee of the privy council  including the same members as the supreme court  is the highest court of appeal for several independent commonwealth countries  the british overseas territories and the crown dependencies        both english law  which applies in england and wales  and northern ireland law are based on common law principles     the essence of common law is that  subject to statute  the law is developed by judges in courts  applying statute  precedent and common sense to the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles  which are reported and binding in future similar cases  stare decisis      the courts of england and wales are headed by the senior courts of england and wales  consisting of the court of appeal  the high court of justice  for civil cases  and the crown court  for criminal cases   the supreme court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in england  wales and northern ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction  often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions        scots law is a hybrid system based on both common law and civil law principles  the chief courts are the court of session  for civil cases     and the high court of justiciary  for criminal cases     the supreme court of the united kingdom serves as the highest court of appeal for civil cases under scots law     sheriff courts deal with most civil and criminal cases including conducting criminal trials with a jury  known as sheriff solemn court  or with a sheriff and no jury  known as sheriff summary court     the scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts for a criminal trial   guilty    not guilty  and  not proven   both  not guilty  and  not proven  result in an acquittal        crime in england and wales increased in the period between      and       though since that peak there has been an overall fall of     in recorded crime from      to         needs update    according

europe  dating to the arrival of chinese seamen in the   th century     in      there were probably fewer than        non white residents in britain  almost all born overseas        since      substantial immigration from africa  the caribbean and south asia has been a legacy of ties forged by the british empire     migration from new eu member states in central and eastern europe since      has resulted in growth in these population groups  although some of this migration has been temporary     since the     s  there has been substantial diversification of the immigrant population  with migrants to the uk coming from a much wider range of countries than previous waves  which tended to involve larger numbers of migrants coming from a relatively small number of countries              academics have argued that the ethnicity categories employed in british national statistics  which were first introduced in the      census  involve confusion between the concepts of ethnicity and
