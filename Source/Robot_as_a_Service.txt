 robot as a service  or raas  is a cloud computing unit that facilities the seamless integration of robot and embedded devices into web and cloud computing environment  in terms of service oriented architecture  soa   a raas unit includes services for performing functionality  a service directory for discovery and publishing  and service clients for user s direct access    the current raas implementation facilitates soap and restful communications between raas units and the other cloud computing units  hardware support and standards are available to support raas implementation  devices profile for web services  dpws  defines implementation constraints to enable secure web service messaging  discovery  description  and eventing on resource constrained devices between web services and devices  raas can be considered a unit of internet of things  iot   internet of intelligent things  ioit  that deal with intelligent devices that have adequate computing capacity   cyber physical system  cps  that is a combination of a large computational and communication core and physical elements that can interact with the physical world   and autonomous decentralized system  ads  whose components are designed to operate in a loosely coupled manner and data are shared through a content oriented protocol                 the initial design and implementation of applying service oriented computing in embedded systems and robots was presented in the   th ifip      workgroups meeting in february        in the initial design  a robot is the service client that looks up the service registry and consumes web services on remote sites  evolved from service oriented robot  robot as a service is an all in one soa unit  that is  the unit includes services for performing functionality  service directory for discovery and publishing  and applications for client s direct access   this all in one design gives the robot unit tools and capacity to be a self contained cloud unit in the cloud computing environment     raas follows soa and is a cloud computing unit  a raas unit acts as a service provider  a service broker  and as a service client     a raas cloud unit is a service provider  each unit hosts a repository of preloaded services  a developer or a client can deploy new services into or remove service from a robot  the services can be used by this robot and can also be shared with other robots     a raas cloud contains a set of applications deployed  a developer or client can compose a new application  functionality  based on the services available in the unit and outside the unit     a raas unit is a service broker  a client can look up the services and applications available in the unit s directory  a client can search and discover the applications and services deployed on the robot by browsing the directory  the services and applications can be organized in a hierarchy of classes to facilitate the discovery  the main components of a raas unit and typical applications and services deployed  raas units are designed for the cloud computing environment  the services in raas will communicate with the drivers and other operating system components  which further communicate with the devices and other hardware components  the raas units can directly communicate with each other through wi fi  if the wireless infrastructure is available or through ad hoc wireless network otherwise  the communication between raas and other services in the cloud are through standard service interface wsdl enabled by dpws or restful service overall http     a few prototypes of raas have been implemented  which include both web interface and physical devices                dependability  including reliability and security are critical in raas design  collaborating raas units can be scheduled for redundant execution  backing up each other s operations  the redundant design can also address the instruction level attack such as code injection and return oriented programming  rop  attacks  as the redundant raas units are independent of each other  instruction level gadget programming is likely to generate different sequences in different devices  these differences in behaviors can be detected by the collaboration among the raas units  the major challenge in designing raas is to deal with the diversity of the networks  applications  and the environments or end users  in cloud computing  the network and communication protocols are limited to a few standards such wsdl  soap  http  and restful architecture  in raas  http  soap  and wsdl standards and robotics applications are the main design considerations     raas can be used in where soa  cloud computing  iot  cps  and ads are used  one the application in computer science education  raas uses existing services to compose different applications at workflow level  which significantly reduce the learning curve of robotics programming
