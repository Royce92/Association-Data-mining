 cloud computing security or  more simply  cloud security is an evolving sub domain of computer security  network security  and  more broadly  information security  it refers to a broad set of policies  technologies  and controls deployed to protect data  applications  and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing             organizations use the cloud in a variety of different service models  saas  paas  and iaas  and deployment models  private  public  hybrid  and community    there are a number of security issues concerns associated with cloud computing but these issues fall into two broad categories  security issues faced by cloud providers  organizations providing software   platform   or infrastructure as a service via the cloud  and security issues faced by their customers  companies or organizations who host applications or store data on the on the cloud    the responsibility goes both ways  however  the provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure and that their clients  data and applications are protected while the user must take measures to fortify their application and use strong passwords and authentication measures     when an organization elects to store data or host applications on the public cloud  it loses its ability to have physical access to the servers hosting its information  as a result  potentially business sensitive and confidential data is at risk from insider attacks  according to a recent cloud security alliance report  insider attacks are the third biggest threat in cloud computing   therefore  cloud service providers must ensure that thorough background checks are conducted for employees who have physical access to the servers in the data center  additionally  data centers must be frequently monitored for suspicious activity     in order to conserve resources  cut costs  and maintain efficiency  cloud service providers often store more than one customer s data on the same server  as a result there is a chance that one user s private data can by viewed by other users  possibly even competitors   to handle such sensitive situations  cloud service providers should ensure proper data isolation and logical storage segregation      the extensive use of virtualization in implementing cloud infrastructure brings unique security concerns for customers or tenants of a public cloud service   virtualization alters the relationship between the os and underlying hardware   be it computing  storage or even networking  this introduces an additional layer   virtualization   that itself must be properly configured  managed and secured   specific concerns include the potential to compromise the virtualization software  or  hypervisor   while these concerns are largely theoretical  they do exist   for example  a breach in the administrator workstation with the management software of the virtualization software can cause the whole datacenter to go down or be reconfigured to an attacker s liking     cloud security architecture is effective only if the correct defensive implementations are in place  an efficient cloud security architecture should recognize the issues that will arise with security management   the security management addresses these issues with security controls  these controls are put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack  while there are many types of controls behind a cloud security architecture  they can usually be found in one of the following categories      in the middle east  engineer g  tello was the pioneer in using cloud security controls     it is generally recommended that information security controls be selected and implemented according and in proportion to the risks  typically by assessing the threats  vulnerabilities and impacts  while cloud security concerns can be grouped into any number of dimensions  e g  gartner named seven  while the cloud security alliance identified fourteen areas of concern    three are outlined below       numerous laws and regulations pertain to the storage and use of data  in the us these include privacy or data protection laws  payment card industry   data security standard  pci dss   the health insurance portability and accountability act  hipaa   the sarbanes oxley act  the federal information security management act of       fisma   and children s online privacy protection act of       among others     similar laws may apply in different legal jurisdictions and may differ quite markedly from those enforced in the us  cloud service users may often need to be aware of the legal and regulatory differences between the jurisdictions  for example data stored by a cloud service provider may be located in  say  singapore and mirrored in the us        many of these regulations mandate particular controls  such as strong access controls and audit trails  and require regular reporting  cloud customers must ensure that their cloud providers adequately fulfil such requirements as appropriate  enabling them to comply with their obligations since  to a large extent  they remain accountable     aside from the security and compliance issues enumerated above  cloud providers and their customers will negotiate terms around liability  stipulating how incidents involving data loss or compromise will be resolved  for example   intellectual property  and end of service  when data and applications are ultimately returned to the customer   in addition  there are considerations for acquiring data from the cloud that may be involved in litigation    these issues are discussed in service level agreements  sla      legal issues may also include records keeping requirements in the public sector  where many agencies are required by law to retain and make available electronic records in a specific fashion  this may be determined by legislation  or law may require agencies to conform to the rules and practices set by a records keeping agency  public agencies using cloud computing and storage must take these concerns into account
