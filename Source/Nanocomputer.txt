 nanocomputer is the logical name for a computer smaller than the microcomputer  which is smaller than the minicomputer   the minicomputer is called  mini  because it was a lot smaller than the original  mainframe  computers      the term nanocomputer is increasingly used to refer to general computing devices of size comparable to a credit card  the first use of this name appears to be to describe the s mp  manufactured by the flying electron inc     november         it is now used for a wider range of devices  such as     a perhaps more principled interpretation  analogous to the first microcomputers having fundamental parts no bigger than several micrometres  is that of a computer whose fundamental parts are no bigger than a few nanometers   there are several ways nanocomputers might be built  using mechanical  electronic  biochemical  or quantum technology  it was argued in      that is unlikely that nanocomputers will be made out of semiconductor transistors  microelectronic components that are at the core of all modern electronic devices   as they seem to perform significantly less well when shrunk to sizes under     nanometers      this is rather contradicted by the smallest part of current state of the art microprocessors measuring   xa nm as of april        moreover intel s   nanometer technology outlook predicts  xa nm feature size by       the international technology roadmap for semiconductors gives an industrial consensus on feature scaling following moore s law     note that a silicon silicon bond length is      xa pm   which means that a  xa nm width transistor would be    silicon atoms wide
