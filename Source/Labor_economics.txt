 labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour  labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers  labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services  workers   the demands of labour services  employers   and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages  employment  and income     in economics  labour is the process in which both man and nature participate  and in which man of his own accord starts  regulates  and controls the material re actions between himself and nature   the elementary factors of the labour process are     the personal activity of man  i e   work itself      the subject of that work  and     its instruments              labour power is a crucial subject in the field of economics  referring to the capacity to labour as distinguished from labour itself      karl marx defined labour power as follows     he adds further on that     labour power is a commodity  it is sold and bought on the market  a worker tries to sell his or her labour power to an employer  in exchange for a wage or salary  if successful  the only alternative being unemployment   this exchange involves submitting to the authority of the capitalist for a specific period of time     during that time  the worker does actual labour  producing goods and services  the capitalist can then sell these and obtain surplus value  since the wages paid to the workers are lower than the value of the goods or services they produce for the capitalist citation needed    labour power can also be sold by the worker on  own account   in which case he is self employed  or it can be sold by an intermediary  such as a hiring agency  in principle a group of workers can also sell their labour power as an independent contracting party  some labour contracts are very complex  involving a number of different intermediaries     normally  the worker is legally the owner of his labour power  and can sell it freely according to his own wishes  however  most often the trade in labour power is regulated by legislation  and the sale may not be truly  free    it may be a forced sale for one reason or another  and indeed it may be bought and sold against the real wishes of the worker even although he owns his own labour power  various gradations of freedom and unfreedom are possible  and free wage labour can combine with slave labour or semi slavery     the concept of labour power as a commodity was first explicitly stated by friedrich engels in the principles of communism            the labour theory of value  ltv  is an economic theory of value that states that the economic value of a good or service is determined by the total amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it  when speaking in terms of labour theory of value  value  without any qualifying adjective should theoretically refer to the amount of labour necessary to the production of a marketable commodity  including the labour necessary to the development of any real capital employed in the production  both david ricardo and karl marx attempted to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price  or natural price of a commodity      when speaking in terms of a labour theory of value  value  without any qualifying adjective should theoretically refer to the amount of labour necessary to the production of a marketable commodity  including the labour necessary to the development of any real capital employed in the production  both david ricardo and karl marx attempted to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price  or natural price of a commodity   the labour theory of value  as presented by adam smith  however  did not require the quantification of all past labour  nor did it deal with the labour needed to create the tools  capital  that might be employed in the production of a commodity  the smith theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labour it would command in others  value in trade  or whatever labour it would  save  the self  value in use   or both  but this  value  is subject to supply and demand at a particular time     the real price of every thing  what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it  is the toil and trouble of acquiring it  what every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it  and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else  is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself  and which it can impose upon other people   wealth of nations book    chapter v     smith s theory of price  which for many is the same as value  has nothing to do with the past labour spent in the production of a commodity  it speaks only of the labour that can be  commanded  or  saved  at present  if there is no use for a buggy whip then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use  regardless of all the labour spent in its creation     value  in use  is the usefulness of this commodity  its utility  a classical paradox often comes up when considering this type of value  in the words of adam smith     the word value  it is to be observed  has two different meanings  and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object  and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys  the one may be called  value in usexa    the other   value in exchange   the things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange  and on the contrary  those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use  nothing is more useful than water  but it will purchase scarce any thing  scarce any thing can be had in exchange for it  a diamond  on the contrary  has scarce any value in use  but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it   wealth of nations book    chapter iv     value  in exchange  is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity  in other words  its price in the case of money   it is relative to labour as explained by adam smith     the value of any commodity xa     to the person who possesses it  and who means not to use or consume it himself  but to exchange it for other commodities  is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command  labour  therefore  is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities  wealth of nations book    chapter v  emphasis added      value  without qualification  is the labour embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production  marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition  in his terms  value is the  socially necessary abstract labour  embodied in a commodity  to ricardo and other classical economists  this definition serves as a measure of  real cost    absolute value   or a  measure of value  invariable under changes in distribution and technology      ricardo  other classical economists  and marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labour value  they thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies     other supporters of the labour theory of value used the word  value  in the second sense  to represent  exchange value       since the term value is understood in the ltv as denoting something created by labour  and its  magnitude  as something proportional to the quantity of labour performed  it is important to explain how the labour process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates note      the value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labour performed on average for its production  part of what the ltv means by  socially necessary  is that the value only increases in proportion to this labour as it is performed with average skill and average productivity  so though workers may labour with greater skill or more productivity than others  these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity  each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity  by working sloppily  unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labour  thus increasing the average labour time necessary for the production of each unit commodity  but these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labour process at a higher price  as opposed to value  simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities     however  production not only involves labour  but also certain means of labour  tools  materials  power plants and so on  these means of labourxa   also known as means of productionxa   are often the product of another labour process as well  so the labour process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value  labour also requires other means of production that are not produced with labour and therefore bear no value  such as sunlight  air  uncultivated land  unextracted minerals  etc  while useful  even crucial to the production process  these bring no value to that process  in terms of means of production resulting from another labour process  ltv treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labour process  due to the constancy of their value  these means of production are referred to  in this light  as constant capital     consider for example workers who take coffee beans  use a roaster to roast them  and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee  in performing this labour  these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee  the worker also transfers the value of constant capitalxa   the value of the beans  some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer  and the value of the cupxa   to the value of the final cup of coffee  again  on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labour previously possessed to the finished cup of coffeenote   so the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labourxa   this constant capitalxa   and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work     often this is expressed mathematically as     note  if the product resulting from the labour process is homogeneous  all similar in quality and traits  for example  all cups of coffee  then the value of the period s product can be divided by the total number of items  use values or   produced to derive the unit value of each item   where  is the total items produced     the ltv further divides the value added during the period of production    into two parts  the first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid  for example  if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid         then the time necessary to add        toxa   while preserving the value ofxa   constant capital is considered the necessary labour portion of the period  or week   denoted   the remaining period is considered the surplus labour portion of the week  or   the value used to purchase labour power  for example the        paid in wages to these workers for the week  is called variable capital     this is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production  variable capital can add value in the labour process  the amount it adds depends on the duration  intensity  productivity and skill of the labour power purchased  in this sense the buyer of labour power has purchased a commodity of variable use  finally  the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labour is performed is called surplus value     from the variables defined above  we find two other common expression for the value produced during a given period as     the first form of the equation expresses the value resulting from production  focusing on the costs  and the surplus value appropriated in the process of production    the second form of the equation focuses on the value of production in terms of the valued added by the labour performed during the process      one issue facing the ltv is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other  if a commodity s value is not the same as its price  and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ  then what is the relation between the two  if any  various ltv schools of thought provide different answers to this question  for example  some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labour embodied in a good acts as a centre of gravity for price     however  most economists would say that cases where pricing is even approximately equal to the value of the labour embodied are only special cases  and not the general case  in the standard formulation  prices also normally include a level of income for  capital  and  land   these incomes are known as  profit  and  rent  respectively     in book    chapter vi  adam smith writes     the real value of all the different component parts of price  it must be observed  is measured by the quantity of labour which they can  each of them  purchase or command  labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour  but of that which resolves itself into rent  and of that which resolves itself into profit     the final sentence explains how smith sees value of a product as relative to labour of buyer or consumer  as opposite to marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labour of labourer or producer  and we value things  price them  based on how much labour we can avoid or command  and we can command labour not only in a simple way but also by trading things for a profit     the demonstration of the relation between commodities  unit values and their respective prices is known in marxian terminology as the transformation problem or the transformation of values into prices of production  the transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the ltv  the problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labour  in proportion to its duration and intensity  is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced  if there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation compared with before then the relation between values  proportional to labour  and prices  proportional to total capital advanced  is incomplete  various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation  but the debate has not reached any clear resolution     ltv does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price  since the price of a commodity is something other than its value  in value  price and profit         karl marx quotes adam smith and sums up     the ltv seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium  this could be explained by a cost of production argument pointing out that all costs are ultimately labour costs  but this does not account for profit  and it is vulnerable to the charge of tautology in that it explains prices by prices   marx later called this  smith s adding up theory of value      smith argues that labour values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen   marx  on the other hand  uses a measurement analogy  arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them    and that labour is a common substance of what marx eventually calls commodity values       the labour theory of value has developed over many centuries  it had no single originator  but rather many different thinkers arrived at the same conclusion independently  some writers trace its origin to thomas aquinas      in his summa theologiae             he expresses the view that      value can  does and should increase in relation to the amount of labour which has been expended in the improvement of commodities     scholars such as joseph schumpeter have cited ibn khaldun  who in his muqaddimah         described labour as the source of value  necessary for all earnings and capital accumulation  he argued that even if earning  results from something other than a craft  the value of the resulting profit and acquired  capital  must  also  include the value of the labour by which it was obtained  without labour  it would not have been acquired     scholars have also pointed to sir william petty s treatise of taxes of        and to john locke s labour theory of property  set out in the second treatise on government         which sees labour as the ultimate source of economic value  karl marx himself credited benjamin franklin in his      essay entitled  a modest enquiry into the nature and necessity of a paper currency  as being  one of the first  to advance the theory       adam smith accepted the theory for pre capitalist societies but saw a flaw in its application to contemporary capitalism  he pointed out that if the  labour embodied  in a product equaled the  labour commanded   i e  the amount of labour that could be purchased by selling it   then profit was impossible  david ricardo  seconded by marx  responded to this paradox by arguing that smith had confused labour with wages   labour commanded   he argued  would always be more than the labour needed to sustain itself  wages   the value of labour  in this view  covered not just the value of wages  what marx called the value of labour power   but the value of the entire product created by labour       ricardo s theory was a predecessor of the modern theory that equilibrium prices are determined solely by production costs associated with neo ricardianism       based on the discrepancy between the wages of labour and the value of the product  the  ricardian socialists xa   charles hall  thomas hodgskin  john gray  and john francis bray  and percy ravenstone  xa   applied ricardo s theory to develop theories of exploitation     marx expanded on these ideas  arguing that workers work for a part of each day adding the value required to cover their wages  while the remainder of their labour is performed for the enrichment of the capitalist  the ltv and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought       th century american individualist anarchists based their economics on the ltv  with their particular interpretation of it being called  cost the limit of price   they  as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition  hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labour required to produce it  hence  they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labour     adam smith held that  in a primitive society  the amount of labour put into producing a good determined its exchange value  with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labour a good can purchase  however  according to smith  in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labour cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production   the whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer  he must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him      nevertheless  the  real value  of such a commodity produced in advanced society is measured by the labour which that commodity will command in exchange xa     but smith disowns what is naturally thought of as the genuine classical labour theory of value  that labour cost regulates market value  this theory was ricardo s  and really his alone        classical economist david ricardo s labour theory of value holds that the value of a good  how much of another good or service it exchanges for in the market  is proportional to how much labour was required to produce it  including the labour required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in the process  david ricardo stated it as   the value of a commodity  or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange  depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production  and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour    ricardo       in this heading ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labour necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the labourers for its production  however  ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labour required to produce them  for example  he said  i cannot get over the difficulty of the wine  which is kept in the cellar for three or four years i e   while constantly increasing in exchange value  or that of the oak tree  which perhaps originally had not   s  expended on it in the way of labour  and yet comes to be worth        quoted in whitaker  of course  a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage  if anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich  that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine  there is also the theory that adding to the price of a luxury product increases its exchange value by mere prestige     the labour theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the subjective theory of value  which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labour was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity  ricardo s labour theory of value is not a normative theory  as are some later forms of the labour theory  such as claims that it is immoral for an individual to be paid less for his labour than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces     it is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labour theory of value as it is commonly defined          for instance  david ricardo theorized that prices are determined by the amount of labour but found exceptions for which the labour theory could not account  in a letter  he wrote   i am not satisfied with the explanation i have given of the principles which regulate value   adam smith theorized that the labour theory of value holds true only in the  early and rude state of society  but not in a modern economy where owners of capital are compensated by profit  as a result   smith ends up making little use of a labour theory of value        pierre joseph proudhon s mutualism   and american individualist anarchists such as josiah warren  lysander spooner and benjamin tucker   adopted the liberal labour theory of value of classical economics but used it to criticise capitalism instead favouring a non capitalist market system       josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist      and the four page weekly paper he edited during       the peaceful revolutionist  was the first anarchist periodical published   cost the limit of price was a maxim coined by josiah warren  indicating a  prescriptive  version of the labour theory of value  warren maintained that the just compensation for labour  or for its product  could only be an equivalent amount of labour  or a product embodying an equivalent amount     thus  profit  rent  and interest were considered unjust economic arrangements   in keeping with the tradition of adam smith s the wealth of nations    the  cost  of labour is considered to be the subjective cost  i e   the amount of suffering involved in it    he put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental  labour for labour store  called the cincinnati time store at the corner of  th and elm streets in what is now downtown cincinnati  where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labour   all the goods offered for sale in warren s store were offered at the same price the merchant himself had paid for them  plus a small surcharge  in the neighborhood of   to   percent  to cover store overhead     the store stayed open for three years  after it closed  warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism  these included  utopia  and  modern times   warren said that stephen pearl andrews  the science of society  published in       was the most lucid and complete exposition of warren s own theories       mutualism is an economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production  either individually or collectively  with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the free market    integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate  just high enough to cover administration    mutualism is based on a labour theory of value that holds that when labour or its product is sold  in exchange  it ought to receive goods or services embodying  the amount of labour necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility     mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon     collectivist anarchism as defended by mikhail bakunin defended a form of labour theory of value when it advocated a system where  all necessaries for production are owned in common by the labour groups and the free communesxa     based on the distribution of goods according to the labour contributed        contrary to popular belief    marx opposed  ascribing a supernatural creative power to labour   arguing that     here marx was distinguishing between exchange value  the subject of the ltv  and use value     marx used the concept of  socially necessary abstract labour time  to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and neoclassical economics  whereas most economists start with the individual s perspective  marx started with the perspective of society as a whole   social production  involves a complicated and interconnected division of labour of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity   abstract  labour refers to a characteristic of commodity producing labour that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous  concrete  types of labour  that is  the concept abstracts from the particular characteristics of all of the labour and is akin to average labour      socially necessary  labour refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity  in a given state of society  under certain social average conditions or production  with a given social average intensity  and average skill of the labour employed     that is  the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions  this explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business  finally  it is not labour per se  which creates value  but labour power sold by free wage workers to capitalists  another distinction to be made is that between productive and unproductive labour  only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value note      there are two sides to labour economics in capitalist systems  labour economics can be seen as the application of microeconomic techniques to the labor market or the use of macroeconomic techniques  microeconomic techniques study the role of individuals in the labour market  macroeconomic techniques look at the interrelations between the labour market  the goods market  the money market  and the foreign trade market  it looks at how these interactions influence macro variables such as employment levels  participation rates  aggregate income and gross domestic product     the labour process is the basis of the connexion between labour and capitalist economics  first  capitalist buys labour power in order to use it  and labour power in use is labour itself  the purchaser of labour power consumes it by setting the seller of it to work  by working  the latter becomes actually  what before he only was potentially  labour power in action  a labourer  in order that his labour may re appear in a commodity  he must  before all things  expend it on something useful  on something capable of satisfying a want of some sort   hence  what the capitalist sets the labourer to produce  is a particular use value  a specified article  the fact that the production of use values  or goods  is carried on under the control of a capitalist and on his behalf  does not alter the general character of that production  we shall  therefore  in the first place  have to consider the labour process independently of the particular form it assumes under given social conditions           the labour force is defined as the number of people of working age  who are either employed or actively looking for work  the participation rate is the number of people in the labour force divided by the size of the adult civilian non institutional population  or by the population of working age that is not institutionalised   the non labour force includes those who are not looking for work  those who are institutionalised such as in prisons or psychiatric wards  stay at home spouses  children  and those serving in the military  the unemployment level is defined as the labour force minus the number of people currently employed  the unemployment rate is defined as the level of unemployment divided by the labour force  the employment rate is defined as the number of people currently employed divided by the adult population  or by the population of working age   in these statistics  self employed people are counted as employed     variables like employment level  unemployment level  labour force  and unfilled vacancies are called stock variables because they measure a quantity at a point in time  they can be contrasted with flow variables which measure a quantity over a duration of time  changes in the labour force are due to flow variables such as natural population growth  net immigration  new entrants  and retirements from the labour force  changes in unemployment depend on  inflows made up of non employed people starting to look for jobs and of employed people who lose their jobs and look for new ones  and outflows of people who find new employment and of people who stop looking for employment  when looking at the overall macroeconomy  several types of unemployment have been identified  including     neo classical economists view the labour market as similar to other markets in that the forces of supply and demand jointly determine price  in this case the wage rate  and quantity  in this case the number of people employed      however  the labour market differs from other markets  like the markets for goods or the financial market  in several ways  perhaps the most important of these differences is the function of supply and demand in setting price and quantity  in markets for goods  if the price is high there is a tendency in the long run for more goods to be produced until the demand is satisfied  with labour  overall supply cannot effectively be manufactured because people have a limited amount of time in the day  and people are not manufactured     the labour market also acts as a non clearing market  according to neoclassical theory most markets have a point of equilibrium without excess surplus or demand  but the labour market is expected to have a persistent level of unemployment  contrasting the labour market to other markets also reveals persistent compensating differentials among similar workers  the standard competitive assumption leads to clear conclusions  workers earn their marginal product of labour       many sociologists  political economists  and heterodox economists claim that labour economics tends to lose sight of the complexity of individual employment decisions citation needed these decisions  particularly on the supply side  are often loaded with considerable emotional baggage and a purely numerical analysis can miss important dimensions of the process  such as social benefits of a high income or wage rate regardless of the marginal utility from increased consumption or specific economic goals     from the perspective of mainstream economics  neoclassical models are not meant to serve as a full description of the psychological and subjective factors that go into a given individual s employment relations  but as a useful approximation of human behaviour in the aggregate  which can be fleshed out further by the use of concepts such as information asymmetry  transaction costs  contract theory etc     also missing from most labour market analyses is the role of unpaid labour  even though this type of labour is unpaid it can nevertheless play an important part in society  the most dramatic example is child raising  however  over the past    years an increasing literature  usually designated as the economics of the family  has sought to study within household decision making  including joint labour supply  fertility  child raising  as well as other areas of what is generally referred to as home production       the labour market  as institutionalised under today s market economic systems  has been criticised    especially by both mainstream socialists and anarcho syndicalists          who utilise the term wage slavery     as a pejorative for wage labour  socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery  cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels       according to noam chomsky  analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the enlightenment era  in his      book on the limits of state action  classical liberal thinker wilhelm von humboldt explained how  whatever does not spring from a man s free choice  or is only the result of instruction and guidance  does not enter into his very nature  he does not perform it with truly human energies  but merely with mechanical exactness  and so when the labourer works under external control   we may admire what he does  but we despise what he is     both the milgram and stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage based workplace relations       the american philosopher john dewey posited that until  industrial feudalism  is replaced by  industrial democracy   politics will be  the shadow cast on society by big business     thomas ferguson has postulated in his investment theory of party competition that the undemocratic nature of economic institutions under capitalism causes elections to become occasions when blocs of investors coalesce and compete to control the state       as per anthropologist david graeber  the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves  usually the owner would receive a share of the money  and the slave  another  with which to maintain his or her living expenses   such arrangements  according to graeber  were quite common in new world slavery as well  whether in the united states or brazil  c  l  r  james argued that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations       additionally  marxists posit that labour as commodity  which is how they regard wage labour    provides an absolutely fundamental point of attack against capitalism     it can be persuasively argued   noted one concerned philosopher   that the conception of the worker s labour as a commodity confirms marx s stigmatisation of the wage system of private capitalism as  wage slavery   that is  as an instrument of the capitalist s for reducing the worker s condition to that of a slave  if not below it
