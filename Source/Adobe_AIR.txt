 adobe integrated runtime  also known as adobe air  is a cross platform runtime system developed by adobe systems for building desktop applications and mobile applications  programmed using adobe flash  actionscript and optionally apache flex  the runtime supports installable applications on windows  os x and mobile operating systems like android  ios and blackberry tablet os  it also originally ran on linux  but support was discontinued as of version     in          notable applications built with adobe air include ebay desktop  tweetdeck   adobe media player   angry birds   machinarium   among other multimedia and task management applications       according to adobe  over         unique applications were built on air  and over   billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world  as of may                      adobe air is a runtime environment that allows adobe flash  actionscript  or html  and javascript code to construct applications and video games that run outside a web browser  and behave like a native application on supported platforms  an application developed for flash player or html  and deployed in a browser does not require installation  while air applications require that users install the application from an installer file  windows and os x  or the appropriate app store  ios and android   air applications have unrestricted access to local storage and file systems  while browser based applications only have access to individual files selected by users       adobe air externally uses adobe flash as the rendering engine  and actionscript   as the primary programming language  flash applications must specifically be built for the adobe air runtime in order to use additional features provided  such as file system integration  native client extensions  greater control over screen  integration with taskbar or dock  and access to accelerometer and gps devices    html  applications may run on the webkit engine included in air     using air  developers can access the full adobe flash functionality  including text  vector graphics  raster graphics  video  audio  camera and microphone capability  adobe air also includes additional features such as file system integration  native client extensions  desktop integration and access to connected devices  air enables applications to work with data in different ways  including using local files  local sqlite databases  for which air has built in support   a database server  or the encrypted local store included with air     developers can access additional functionality by building air native extensions  which can access full device functionality being programmed in the native language       on desktop platforms  air supports     on mobile platforms  air supports many mobile hardware features  including hardware accelerated graphics rendering  touch screen gestures  camera and microphone  accelerometer and networking with http  tcp and udp protocols  air gamepad allows mobile applications to serve as secondary displays and controllers for flash games       in       the addition of stage d to the flash player allowed flash and air apps access to gpus for hardware acceleration  several third party frameworks have been developed to build upon the functionality of stage d  including the starling framework and away d  these frameworks are also compatible with air  and provide vital performance improvements to air apps published for mobile devices     air apps can be augmented in functionality with the usage of air native extensions  anes   native extensions are plug in code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an actionscript api    allowing developers to access native features not otherwise usable in air  such as apple game center or google cloud messaging     native extensions may be developed by anyone using publicly available tools    some are distributed for free or even as open source  while others are sold commercially       native extensions may be programmed in the native language on each platform  allowing access to the full set of platform apis provided by the developer   c   for windows  java for android  objective c for ios        air is a cross platform technology and air applications can be repackaged with few or no changes for many popular desktop and mobile platforms  different installation options exist for each platform     air applications may be published with or without the air runtime  applications packaged with the air runtime are larger in file size  and are known as  captive runtime  applications    if the runtime is not embedded in the app  it must be installed separately     in january       adobe claimed that there were over     million installations of adobe air worldwide  and that  the majority of air runtime installations occur at the time the first air application is installed by a user     in may       adobe claimed that over         unique applications were built on air  and over   billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world         the latest version of adobe air  version    contains adobe flash player     and is available for windows xp and later  as well as os x    official support for desktop linux distributions ceased in june      with version           adobe air is installed with adobe reader    released in july         adobe photoshop and adobe lightroom  with no option for exclusion       adobe air applications can be published as native phone applications on certain mobile operating systems  such as android  arm cortex a  and above    and apple ios       the following table explains to what extent adobe air can run on various mobile operating systems     option    the runtime is not included with the app  and must installed as a separate app from the app market       adobe air runs flash applications within a contained flash player instance  it runs web applications via webkit rendering engine  multiple instances of the browser can be started within a single air application  but javascript content executes with some security limitations     air does not provide direct access to native gui elements such as navigation bars or controls  native extensions can be used to access additional native resources     the air sdk is available as a free standalone download for software developers to make air applications    sdk users do not need to install any commercial software to use the sdk  although several options are available  air apps can be compiled from the command line using the air compiler included in the sdk  the compiler can also be called from an ide to obviate the need for the command line     air can also be used with adobe flex    flex is an integrated collection of stylable graphical user interface  data manipulation and networking components  and applications built upon it are known as  flex  applications  flex guis are defined in mxml  similar to how android and microsoft visual studio define guis  however  flex does not give access to native gui components     air applications built without the flex framework allow greater flexibility and performance  and are known as  pure actionscript  applications          video games built on the air platform are typically pure actionscript projects  various open source component frameworks are available for pure actionscript projects  such as madcomponents  that provide ui components at significantly smaller swf file sizes         adobe distributes three commercial software products for developing of air applications in actionscript     third party development environments that target the air runtime are also available  including     adobe flash builder is the premium tool for flex application development  since it includes an integrated drag and drop user interface builder  not found in competing tools like flashdevelop       adobe provides for air html  and javascript development with adobe dreamweaver cs   although any other html editor or text editor can be used       adobe air can run a subset of javascript  with no ability to dynamically execute code when running in the application sandbox  according to adobe  this restriction is designed to prevent malicious remote content from attacking a user s system    because of this restriction  javascript frameworks that make use of dynamic javascript functions like eval   were not initially compatible with adobe air  however  several frameworks including dojo toolkit citation needed jquery citation needed and extjscitation needed were updated to run in adobe air s application sandbox  some frameworks like mootools were already compatible citation needed    dreamweaver cs  cs  requires an additional extension to compile air applications    as does flash cs  in the form of an update        apollo      betas adobe made a public preview release of air  then called apollo  along with a software development kit  sdk  and extension for developing apollo applications with the flex framework  on march              on june           apollo was renamed to air and a public beta release of the runtime was launched  public beta   of air sdk was released on october          public beta    was released on december                x    adobe air     version     of the adobe air runtime and
