 a monitor or a display is an electronic visual display for computers  the monitor comprises the display device  circuitry and an enclosure  the display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display  tft lcd  thin panel  while older monitors used a cathode ray tube  crt  about as deep as the screen size     originally  computer monitors were used for data processing while television receivers were used for entertainment  from the     s onwards  computers  and their monitors  have been used for both data processing and entertainment  while televisions have implemented some computer functionality  the common aspect ratio of televisions  and then computer monitors  has also changed from     to                  early electronic computers were fitted with a panel of light bulbs where the state of each particular bulb would indicate the on off state of a particular register bit inside the computer  this allowed the engineers operating the computer to monitor the internal state of the machine  so this panel of lights came to be known as the  monitor   as early monitors were only capable of displaying a very limited amount of information  and were very transient  they were rarely considered for programme output  instead  a line printer was the primary output device  while the monitor was limited to keeping track of the programme s operation     as technology developed it was realized that the output of a crt display was more flexible than a panel of light bulbs and eventually  by giving control of what was displayed to the programme itself  the monitor itself became a powerful output device in its own right     multiple technologies have been used for computer monitors  until the   st century most used cathode ray tubes but they have largely been superseded by lcd monitors     the first computer monitors used cathode ray tubes  crts   prior to the advent of home computers in the late     s  it was common for a video display terminal  vdt  using a crt to be physically integrated with a keyboard and other components of the system in a single large chassis  the display was monochrome and far less sharp and detailed than on a modern flat panel monitor  necessitating the use of relatively large text and severely limiting the amount of information that could be displayed at one time  high resolution crt displays were developed for specialized military  industrial and scientific applications but they were far too costly for general use     some of the earliest home computers  such as the trs    and commodore pet  were limited to monochrome crt displays  but color display capability was already a standard feature of the pioneering apple ii  introduced in       and the specialty of the more graphically sophisticated atari      introduced in       either computer could be connected to the antenna terminals of an ordinary color tv set or used with a purpose made crt color monitor for optimum resolution and color quality  lagging several years behind  in      ibm introduced the color graphics adapter  which could display four colors with a resolution of     x     pixels  or it could produce     x     pixels with two colors  in      ibm introduced the enhanced graphics adapter which was capable of producing    colors and had a resolution of     x          by the end of the     s color crt monitors that could clearly display      x     pixels were widely available and increasingly affordable  during the following decade maximum display resolutions gradually increased and prices continued to fall  crt technology remained dominant in the pc monitor market into the new millennium partly because it was cheaper to produce and offered viewing angles close to     degrees   crts still offer some image quality advantages over lcd displays but improvements to the latter have made them much less obvious  the dynamic range of early lcd panels was very poor  and although text and other motionless graphics were sharper than on a crt  an lcd characteristic known as pixel lag caused moving graphics to appear noticeably smeared and blurry     there are multiple technologies that have been used to implement liquid crystal displays  lcd   throughout the     s  the primary use of lcd technology as computer monitors was in laptops where the lower power consumption  lighter weight  and smaller physical size of lcds justified the higher price versus a crt  commonly  the same laptop would be offered with an assortment of display options at increasing price points   active or passive  monochrome  passive color  or active matrix color  tft   as volume and manufacturing capability have improved  the monochrome and passive color technologies were dropped from most product lines     tft lcd is a variant of lcd which is now the dominant technology used for computer monitors      the first standalone lcd displays appeared in the mid     s selling for high prices  as prices declined over a period of years they became more popular  and by      were competing with crt monitors  among the first desktop lcd computer monitors was the eizo l   in the mid     s  the apple studio display in       and the apple cinema display in       in       tft lcds outsold crts for the first time  becoming the primary technology used for computer monitors   the main advantages of lcds over crt displays are that lcds consume less power  take up much less space  and are considerably lighter  the now common active matrix tft lcd technology also has less flickering than crts  which reduces eye strain   on the other hand  crt monitors have superior contrast  have superior response time  are able to use multiple screen resolutions natively  and there is no discernible flicker if the refresh rate is set to a sufficiently high value  lcd monitors have now very high temporal accuracy and can be used for vision research      organic light emitting diode  oled  monitors provide higher contrast and better viewing angles than lcds but they require more power when displaying documents with white or bright backgrounds  in       a    inch    xa cm  oled monitor cost        but the prices are expected to drop      the performance of a monitor is measured by the following parameters     on two dimensional display devices such as computer monitors the display size or viewable image size is the actual amount of screen space that is available to display a picture  video or working space  without obstruction from the case or other aspects of the unit s design  the main measurements for display devices are  width  height  total area and the diagonal     the size of a display is usually by monitor manufacturers given by the diagonal  i e  the distance between two opposite screen corners  this method of measurement is inherited from the method used for the first generation of crt television  when picture tubes with circular faces were in common use  being circular  only their diameter was needed to describe their size  since these circular tubes were used to display rectangular images  the diagonal measurement of the rectangle was equivalent to the diameter of the tube s face  this method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles  it had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size  and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally         the estimation of the monitor size by the distance between opposite corners does not take into account the display aspect ratio  so that for example a         inch    xa cm  widescreen display has less area  than a    inch    xa cm      screen  the     screen has dimensions of     xa in  xa     xa in    xa cm  xa   xa cm  and area    xa sqxa in       xa cm    while the widescreen is     xa in  xa     xa in    xa cm  xa   xa cm      xa sqxa in       xa cm       until about       most computer monitors had a     aspect ratio and some had      between      and       monitors with      and mostly             aspect ratios became commonly available  first in laptops and later also in standalone monitors  reasons for this transition was productive uses for such monitors  i e  besides widescreen computer game play and movie viewing  are the word processor display of two standard letter pages side by side  as well as cad displays of large size drawings and cad application menus at the same time    in            became the most common sold aspect ratio for lcd monitors and the same year       was the mainstream standard for laptops and notebook computers      in      the computer industry started to move over from       to      because      was chosen to be the standard high definition television display size  and because they were cheaper to manufacture  eventually  monitors with non hd resolutions such as     x     were no longer produced       in      non widescreen displays with     aspect ratios were only being manufactured in small quantities  according to samsung this was because the  demand for the old  square monitors  has decreased rapidly over the last couple of years   and  i predict that by the end of       production on all     or similar panels will be halted due to a lack of demand        the resolution for computer monitors has increased over time  from    x    during the early     s  to    x    during the late     s  since       the most commonly sold resolution for computer monitors is     x        top end consumer products are limited to     x     at   xa in    xa cm   excluding apple products    apple introduced     x     with retina macbook pro at     xa in    xa cm  on june           and introduced a     x     retina imac at   xa in    xa cm  on october              most modern monitors will switch to a power saving mode if no video input signal is received  this allows modern operating systems to turn off a monitor after a specified period of inactivity  this also extends the monitor s service life     some monitors will also switch themselves off after a time period on standby     most modern laptops provide a method of screen dimming after periods of inactivity or when the battery is in use  this extends battery life and reduces wear     many monitors have other accessories  or connections for them  integrated  this places standard ports within easy reach and eliminates the need for another separate hub  camera  microphone  or set of speakers  these monitors have advanced microprocessors which contain codec information  windows interface drivers and other small software which help in proper functioning of these functions     some displays  especially newer lcd monitors  replace the traditional anti glare matte finish with a glossy one  this increases color saturation and sharpness but reflections from lights and windows are very visible  anti reflective coatings are sometimes applied to help reduce reflections  although this only mitigates the effect     in about       nec alienware together with ostendo technologies  based in carlsbad  ca  were offering a curved  concave     inch     xa cm  monitor that allows better viewing angles near the edges  covering     of peripheral vision  this monitor had     x    resolution  led backlight and was marketed as suitable both for gaming and office work  while for       it was rather expensive    as of       the monitor is no longer available  ostendo technologies is no longer pursuing curved monitor technology     narrow viewing angle screens are used in some security conscious applications     newer monitors are able to display a different image for each eye  often with the help of special glasses  giving the perception of depth     a directional screen which generates  d images without headgear     these monitors use touching of the screen as an input method  items can be selected or moved with a finger  and finger gestures may be used to convey commands  the screen will need frequent cleaning due to image degradation from fingerprints     a combination of a monitor with a graphics tablet  such devices are typically unresponsive to touch without the use of one or more special tools  pressure  newer models however are now able to detect touch from any pressure and often have the ability to detect tilt and rotation as well     touch and tablet screens are used on lcd displays as a substitute for the light pen  which can only work on crts     computer monitors are provided with a variety of methods for mounting them depending on the application and environment     a desktop monitor is typically provided with a stand from the manufacturer which lifts the monitor up to a more ergonomic viewing height  the stand may be attached to the monitor using a proprietary method or may use  or be adaptable to  a video electronics standards association  vesa  standard mount  using a vesa standard mount allows the monitor to be used with an after market stand once the original stand is removed  stands may be fixed or offer a variety of features such as height adjustment  horizontal swivel  and landscape or portrait screen orientation     the flat display mounting interface  fdmi   also known as vesa mounting interface standard  mis  or colloquially as a vesa mount  is a family of standards defined by the video electronics standards association for mounting flat panel monitors  tvs  and other displays to stands or wall mounts    it is implemented on most modern flat panel monitors and tvs     for computer monitors  the vesa mount typically consists of four threaded holes on the rear of the display that will mate with an adapter bracket     rack mount computer monitors are available in two styles and are intended to be mounted into a    inch rack     a fixed rack mount monitor is mounted directly to the rack with the lcd visible at all times  the height of the unit is measured in rack units  ru  and  u or  u are most common to fit    inch or    inch lcd displays  the front sides of the unit are provided with flanges to mount to the rack  providing appropriately spaced holes or slots for the rack mounting screws  a    inch diagonal lcd is the largest size that will fit within the rails of a    inch rack  larger lcds may be accommodated but are  mount on rack  and extend forward of the rack  there are smaller display units  typically used in broadcast environments  which fit multiple smaller lcd displays side by side into one rack mount     a stowable rack mount monitor is  u   u or  u high and is mounted on rack slides allowing the display to be folded down and the unit slid into the rack for storage  the display is visible only when the display is pulled out of the rack and deployed  these units may include only a display or may be equipped with a keyboard creating a kvm  keyboard video monitor   most common are systems with a single lcd display but there are systems providing two or three displays in a single rack mount system     a panel mount computer monitor is intended for mounting into a flat surface with the front of the display unit protruding just slightly  they may also be mounted to the rear of the panel  a flange is provided around the lcd display  sides  top and bottom  to allow mounting  this contrasts with a rack mount display where the flanges are only on the sides  the flanges will be provided with holes for thru bolts or may have studs welded to the rear surface to secure the unit in the hole in the panel  often a gasket is provided to provide a water tight seal to the panel and the front of the lcd will be sealed to the back of the front panel to prevent water and dirt contamination     an open frame monitor provides the lcd monitor and enough supporting structure to hold associated electronics and to minimally support the lcd  provision will be made for attaching the unit to some external structure for support and protection  open frame lcd displays are intended to be built in to some other piece of equipment  an arcade video game would be a good example with the display mounted inside the cabinet  there is usually an open frame display inside all end use displays with the end use display simply providing an attractive protective enclosure  some rack mount lcd display manufacturers will purchase desk top displays  take them apart  and discard the outer plastic parts  keeping the inner open frame lcd display for inclusion into their product     according to an nsa document leaked to der spiegel  the nsa sometimes swaps the monitor cables on targeted computers with a bugged monitor cable in order to allow the nsa to remotely see what s displayed on the targeted computer monitor       van eck phreaking is the process of remotely displaying the contents of a crt or lcd display by detecting its electromagnetic emissions  it is named after dutch computer researcher wim van eck  who in      published the first paper on it  including proof of concept  phreaking is the process of exploiting telephone networks  used here because of its connection to eavesdropping citation needed
