 netbsd is an open source  unix like operating system that descends from berkeley software distribution  bsd   a research unix derivative developed at the university of california  berkeley  it was the second open source bsd descendant formally released after it forked from the    bsd  branch of the bsd source code  repository  it continues to be actively developed and is available for many platforms  including large scale server systems  desktop systems  and handheld devices   and is often used in embedded systems       a major netbsd project goal is a clean  well designed  portable operating system  one that adheres to strict open source code transparency traceable to its inception               netbsd was originally derived from the    bsd release of the berkeley software distribution from the computer systems research group of the university of california  berkeley  via their net   source code release and the    bsd project   the netbsd project began as a result of frustration within the    bsd developer community with the pace and direction of the operating system s development   the four founders of the netbsd project  chris demetriou  theo de raadt  adam glass  and charles hannum  felt that a more open development model would benefit the project  one centered on portable  clean  correct code  they aimed to produce a unified  multi platform  production quality  bsd based operating system  the name  netbsd  was suggested by de raadt  based on the importance and growth of networks such as the internet at that time  and the distributed  collaborative nature of its development     the netbsd source code repository was established on    march      and the first official release  netbsd      was made in april         this was derived from    bsd     plus the version       unofficial patchkit  with several programs from the net   release missing from    bsd re integrated  and various other improvements   the first multi platform release  netbsd      was made in october       also in       for disputed reasons  one of the founders  theo de raadt  left the project  he later founded a new project  openbsd  from a forked version of netbsd     near the end of         in       netbsd     introduced the pkgsrc packages collection       until       netbsd   x releases were made at roughly annual intervals  with minor  patch  releases in between  from release     onwards  netbsd uses semantic versioning  and each major netbsd release corresponds to an incremented major version number  i e  the major releases following     are          and so on  the previous minor releases are now divided into two categories  x y  stable  maintenance releases and x y z releases containing only security and critical fixes       as the project s motto   of course it runs netbsd    suggests  netbsd has been ported to a large number of     and    bit architectures  these range from vax minicomputers to pocket pc pdas  as of       netbsd supports    hardware platforms  across    different processor architectures   the kernel and userland for these platforms are all built from a central unified source code tree managed by cvs  currently  unlike other kernels such as  clinux  the netbsd kernel requires the presence of an mmu in any given target architecture     netbsd s portability is aided by the use of hardware abstraction layer interfaces for low level hardware access such as bus input output or dma  using this portability layer  device drivers can be split into  machine independent  and  machine dependent  components  this makes a single driver easily usable on several platforms by hiding hardware access details  and reduces the work to port it to a new system       this permits a particular device driver for a pci card to work without modifications  whether it s in a pci slot on an ia     alpha  powerpc  sparc  or other architecture with a pci bus  also  a single driver for a specific device can operate via several different buses  like isa  pci  or pc card     in comparison  linux device driver code often must be reworked for each new architecture  as a consequence  in porting efforts by netbsd and linux developers  netbsd has taken much less time to port to new hardware   betterxa sourcexa needed    this platform independence aids the development of embedded systems  particularly since netbsd      when the entire toolchain of compilers  assemblers  linkers  and other tools fully support cross compiling     in       as a demonstration of netbsd s portability and suitability for embedded applications  technologic systems  a vendor of embedded systems hardware  designed and demonstrated a netbsd powered kitchen toaster       commercial ports to embedded platforms  including the amd geode lx     freescale powerquicc processors  marvell orion  amcc     family of powerpc processors  intel xscale iop and ixp series  were available from and supported by wasabi systems     the netbsd cross compiling framework  also known as  build sh     lets a developer build a complete netbsd system for an architecture from a more powerful system of different architecture  cross compiling   including on a different operating system  the framework supports most posix compliant systems   several embedded systems using netbsd have required no additional software development other than toolchain and target rehost       netbsd features pkgsrc  short for  package source    a framework for building and managing third party application software packages  the pkgsrc collection consists of more than       packages as of october     update    building and installing packages such as kde  gnome  the apache http server or perl is performed through the use of a system of makefiles  this can automatically fetch the source code  unpack  patch  configure  build and install the package such that it can be removed again later  an alternative to compiling from source is to use a precompiled binary package  in either case  any prerequisites dependencies will be installed automatically by the package system  without need for manual intervention     pkgsrc supports not only netbsd  but also several other bsd variants like freebsd and darwin mac os x  and other unix like operating systems such as linux  solaris  irix  and others  as well as interix  pkgsrc has also been adopted as the official package management system for dragonfly bsd       netbsd has supported smp since the netbsd     release in         which was initially implemented using the giant lock approach  during the development cycle of the netbsd   release  major work was done to improve smp support  most of the kernel subsystems were modified to be mp safe and use the fine grained locking approach  new synchronization primitives were implemented and scheduler activations was replaced with a     threading model in february         a scalable m  thread scheduler was implemented  though the old    bsd scheduler still remains the default but was modified to scale with smp  threaded software interrupts were implemented to improve synchronization  the virtual memory system  memory allocator and trap handling were made mp safe  the file system framework  including the vfs and major file systems were modified to be mp safe  since april       the only subsystems running with a giant lock are the network protocols and most device drivers     netbsd provides various features in the security area    the kernel authorization framework    or kauth  is a subsystem managing all authorization requests inside the kernel  and used as system wide security policy  it allows external modules to plug in the authorization process  netbsd also incorporates exploit mitigation features    aslr  mprotect and segvguard from pax project  and gcc stack smashing protection  ssp  or also known as propolice  enabled by default since netbsd      compiler extensions  verified executables  or veriexec  is an in kernel file integrity subsystem in netbsd  it allows the user to set digital fingerprints  hashes  of files  and take a number of different actions if files do not match their fingerprints  for example  one can allow perl to run only scripts that match their fingerprints    the cryptographic device driver  cgd  allows using disks or partitions  including cds and dvds  for encrypted storage       the xen virtual machine monitor has been supported in netbsd since release      the use of xen requires a special pre kernel boot environment that loads a xen specialized kernel as the  host os   dom    any number of  guest oses   domu  virtualized computers  with or without specific xen domu support  can be run in parallel with the appropriate hardware resources     the need for a third party boot manager  such as grub  was eliminated with netbsd   s xen compatible boot manager    netbsd   as a dom  has been benchmarked comparably to linux  with better performance than linux in some tests       user space virtualization such as virtualbox and qemu are also supported on netbsd     netbsd     introduced the rump kernel  an architecture to run drivers in user space by emulating kernel space calls  this anykernel architecture allows adding support of netbsd drivers to other kernel architectures  ranging from exokernels to monolithic kernels       netbsd includes many enterprise features like iscsi  a journaling filesystem  logical volume management and the zfs filesystem     the wapbl journaling filesystem  an extension of the bsd ffs filesystem  was contributed by wasabi systems in            the netbsd logical volume manager is based on a bsd reimplementation of a device mapper driver and a port of the linux logical volume manager tools  it was mostly written during the google summer of code            the zfs filesystem developed by sun microsystems was imported into the netbsd base system in       currently  the netbsd zfs port is based on zfs version        the chfs flash memory filesystem was imported into netbsd in november       chfs is a file system developed at the department of software engineering  university of szeged  hungary  and is the first open source flash specific file system written for netbsd     at the source code level  netbsd is very nearly entirely compliant with posix    ieee              standard and mostly compliant with posix    ieee                  netbsd also provides system call level binary compatibility on the appropriate processor architectures with several unix derived and unix like operating systems  including linux  other bsd variants like freebsd  apple s darwin  solaris and sunos    this allows netbsd users to run many applications that are only distributed in binary form for other operating systems  usually with no significant loss of performance       a variety of  foreign  disk filesystem formats are also supported in netbsd  including fat  ntfs  linux ext fs  mac os x ufs  risc os filecore adfs  amigaos fast file system  irix efs and many more through fuse     all of the netbsd kernel and most of the core userland source code is released under the terms of the bsd license  two  three  and four clause variants   this essentially allows everyone to use  modify  redistribute or sell it as they wish  as long as they do not remove the copyright notice and license text  the four clause variants also include terms relating to publicity material   thus  the development of products based on netbsd is possible without having to make modifications to the source code public  in contrast  the gpl stipulates that changes to source code of a product must be released to the product recipient when products derived from those changes are released     on    june       the netbsd foundation announced a transition to the two clause bsd license  citing concerns with ucb support of clause   and industry applicability of clause         netbsd also includes the gnu development tools and other packages  which are covered by the gpl and other open source licenses  as with other bsd projects  netbsd separates those in its base source tree to make it easier to remove code that is under more restrictive licenses    as for packages  the installed software licenses may be controlled by modifying the list of allowed licenses in the pkgsrc configuration file  mk conf      the following table lists major netbsd releases and their notable features in reverse chronological order  minor and patch releases are not included     this release also introduces netbsd packet filter  npf    a new packet filter  designed with multi core systems in mind  which can do tcp ip traffic filtering  stateful inspection  and network address translation  smp support for xen domu kernels  initial suspend resume support for xen domu  pci pass through support for xen   and addition of the balloon driver  major rework of mips port adding support for smp and    bit  o    n    n   abis are supported  processors  dsp v  ase extension  various netlogic rmi processor models  loongson family processors  and new soc boards  improved smp on powerpc port and added support for book e freescale mpc  xx  e    core  processors  arm has gained support for cortex a  processors  various new socs  and initial support for raspberry pi  to address the year      problem  time t was extended to    bit type on all netbsd ports     the netbsd  flag  logo  designed by grant bissett  was introduced in      and is an abstraction of their older logo    designed by shawn mueller in       mueller s version was based on the famous world war ii photograph raising the flag on iwo jima  which some perceived as culturally insensitive and inappropriate for an international project       the netbsd foundation is the legal entity that owns the intellectual property and trademarks associated with netbsd    and on    january       became a     c   tax exempt non profit organization  the members of the foundation are developers who have cvs commit access    the netbsd foundation has a board of directors  elected by the voting of members for two years       netbsd s clean design  high performance  scalability  and support for many architectures has led to its use in embedded devices and servers  especially in networking applications       a commercial real time operating system  qnx  uses a network stack based on netbsd code      and provides various drivers ported from netbsd       dell force   uses netbsd as the underlying operating system that powers ftos  the force   operating system   which is used in high scalability switch routers    force   also made a donation to the netbsd foundation in      to help further research and the open development community       wasabi systems provides a commercial wasabi certified bsd product based on netbsd with proprietary enterprise features and extensions  which are focused on embedded  server and storage applications       netbsd was used in nasa s sams ii project of measuring the microgravity environment on the international space station   betterxa sourcexa needed and for investigations of tcp for use in satellite networks       in       sunet used netbsd to set the internet  land speed record  netbsd was chosen  due to the scalability of the tcp code        netbsd is also used in apple s airport extreme and time capsule products      instead of their own os x  which uses freebsd s userland    platform     the operating system of the t mobile sidekick lx      smartphone is based on netbsd       the minix operating system uses a mostly netbsd userland as well as its pkgsrc packages infrastructure since version           hosting for the project is provided primarily by the internet systems consortium inc  columbia university  and western washington university  mirrors for the project are spread around the world and provided by volunteers and supporters of the project     use of chmod    use of
