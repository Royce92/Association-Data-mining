 binary runtime environment for wireless  brew mp  brew  or brew  is an application development platform created by qualcomm  originally for code division multiple access  cdma  mobile phones  featuring third party applications such as mobile games  it is offered in some feature phones but not in smartphones  it debuted in september          as a software platform that can download and run small programs for playing games  sending messages  and sharing photos  the main advantage of brew mp is that the application developers can easily port their applications among all brew mp devices by providing a standardized set of application programming interfaces  software for brew mp enabled handsets can be developed in c or c   using the freely downloadable brew mp software development kit  sdk    the brew runtime library is part of the wireless device on chip firmware or operating system to allow programmers to develop applications without needing to code for system interface or understand wireless applications  brew is described as a pseudo operating system  but not a true mobile operating system  brew is not a virtual machine such as java me  but runs native code             for software developers  brew mp is a full set of application programming interfaces  api  that enables making software and applications in c  c    java  and is supported  platform  by an application specific integrated circuit  asic   it has a memory footprint of about        k  brew mp runs on brew rtos     for testing applications during the development process  the sdk includes a brew emulator  or starting with brew version       and above  the brew simulator  the brew environment provides for multiple levels of application signatures  one signature authenticates the developer  another signature verifies that an application has passed true brew testing and is bestowed through intertek  the individual telecommunications operators configure the handsets to either enforce or ignore the presence and verification of this second signature  brew enabled handsets have a test mode that allows applications to bypass verification of the signature  qualcomm makes applications that have passed testing available to brew enabled wireless network operators  the operators are then able to choose which of these applications to make available to end users on their catalog     the brew emulator  named brew simulator  does not emulate handset hardware  instead  the brew application is compiled to native code and linked with a compatible brew runtime library  because of this  applications cannot be tested for platform bugs related to memory alignment and various firmware related glitches without a brew handset operating in test mode     for testing purposes  brew applications can be transferred using a universal serial bus  usb  or serial cable to any brew compatible handset using brew apploader from qualcomm  a brew application contains several components which  if not present and valid  cause the application to be automatically deleted on reboot  this includes the compiled binary file  a file which describes the application  the features it uses and permissions requested  a file that contains string and image resources if required  and a file containing the application s digital signature     brew applications may be unloaded from a consumer handset to save handset memory space  this is referred to as  disable restore   and is a requirement of the true brew test process  saved files are kept intact using disable restore  and it is possible to re load the application without paying for it again  in a  disable  situation  all  bar   mod  and  sig files are deleted from the handset  while any other files remain in their original place  during the  restore  operation  the  bar   mod  and sig files are downloaded from the carrier s mobile store  and the previously disabled application will have full functionality remaining  the disable restore process is only available to consumer users once the handset s memory is full     on may           qualcomm and adobe announced a partnership to integrate adobe flash lite as a supported user interface on brew     since march       the least expensive digital signature package for developers costs us     for     application submissions      time to market can take longer with brew than with java me because of brew s rigorous certification requirements  this certification process may be perceived as an advantage by established software developers because the difficulties associated with testing and development costs create a high cost of entry to developers with low budgets and little time  resulting in less market dilution  specifically  developers of casual games run less risk of having to compete with freeware workalikes developed and self published by hobbyists  however this comes as a cost to the end user as there s less competition to develop the best solution for the cheapest price to the end user     currently  most developers choose to support both java me and brew  or only java me  java me may offer a lower cost to market because most carriers allow non certified java me applications to run on their phones  java me is widely used in europe  while brew is primarily used in the u s  and japan  even in the u s   java me phones have a larger market share than brew enabled handsets  one of the initial advantages of brew was that verizon made it easy to purchase applications from the phone  while most java me carriers did not  however  most carriers of java me phones now offer easy to access purchasing portals     there are now commercial technologies to fully automate porting from java me to brew  this reduces the entry barrier to produce brew applications by eliminating the need to develop two versions of the same application in both java and c c       brew os is used by some mobile phone manufacturers and mobile networks  however most often the end user does not know this since mobile phones running brew most often lack any brew os branding and brew runs in the background with the custom  skins  of the mobile phone manufacturer or operator on top  brew os is used by sprint nextel  metropcs  u s  cellular  verizon  syringa wireless  cricket wireless  and at t  in the htc freestyle  in the us and by the   network in much of europe  the uk and australia on many mobile phones produced especially for their network     manufacturers such as huawei  inq mobile  amoi  lg  samsung mobile  zte  and htc amongst others use brew os in some of their mobile phones and it is featured in   uk phones such as the   skypephone  inq   zte z     lg t    and huawei u        touch      motorola t    as well as razr v m also use brew os
