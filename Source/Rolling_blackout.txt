 a rolling blackout  also referred to as rotational load shedding or feeder rotation  is an intentionally engineered electrical power shutdown where electricity delivery is stopped for non overlapping periods of time over different parts of the distribution region  rolling blackouts are a last resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system  they are a type of demand response for a situation where the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network  rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network or may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents  rolling blackouts generally result from two causes  insufficient generation capacity or inadequate transmission infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area where it is needed     rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many developing countries where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or infrastructure is poorly managed  rolling blackouts in developed countries are rare because demand is accurately forecasted  adequate infrastructure investment is scheduled and networks are well managed  such events are considered an unacceptable failure of planning and can cause significant political damage to responsible governments  in well managed under capacity systems blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them but in most cases they happen without warning  typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the  safe  limit  rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly such as through an extreme weather event             during the second half of     s  long accumulated problems in various areas of the country had combined to form a larger crisis  an increased external debt and limited soviet energy supplies forced the bulgarian socialist government to introduce power cuts     in january       the canadian province of newfoundland   labrador renewed rolling blackouts to compensate for the cascading failure of the holyrood generating station after a fire at the sunnyside substation on jan   following a blizzard  the rolling blackouts started before the storm on the  th  rather were caused by extreme cold weather and a high demand for power at the time      on   july       the alberta electric system operator ordered power companies in the province of alberta to institute rolling blackouts during a heat wave as six generating plants failed during peak demand in the heat of the afternoon      summer blackouts have been common in egypt since      but became more severe and widespread after the      revolution  in april       the minister of electricity and renewable energy said that the problem would take a few years to resolve   the government is blaming on the unrest the country is experiencing for the blackouts  however  blame between the different ministries reveals their poor organization  some also point to the fact that the infrastructure is old and lacks maintenance      after the great      blackout in italy  a rolling blackout program pesse  it piano di emergenza per la sicurezza del sistema elettrico en  emergency plan for national grid safety  was issued  it has   degrees of severity  any controlled blackout can t exceed    minutes     due to a chronic shortage of electricity  power cuts are common throughout india  adversely affecting the country s potential for economic growth    even in the country s capital of new delhi  rolling blackouts are common  especially during the hot summer season when demand far outstrips supply capacity  rural areas are the most severely affected  it is common for the     of rural households having access to electricity to lose power for more than    hours each day   the states periodically and chronically affected by load shedding are delhi  uttar pradesh  tamil nadu  bihar  odisha  assam  maharashtra  madhya pradesh  rajasthan and andhra pradesh  the states of punjab  goa  gujarat and kerala are largely free of any load shedding due to surplus power  karnataka still occasionally experiences power cuts   mumbai  india s financial capital  however continues to enjoy uninterrupted power supply throughout the year  west bengal also have developed its potential in minimising rolling blackout or load shedding  eventhough india gets some percentage of its energy requirement from its neighbouring country bhutan and has future prospects of importing from nepal   but it is still largely unsuccessful in reducing power cuts which is disappointing for the country as a whole     japan instituted rolling blackouts starting on    march      due to power shortages caused by the      t hoku earthquake and tsunami  the tokyo electric power company  which normally provides approximately        mw of electricity  announced that it could only provide about        mw  a shortfall of    percent  this is because about    percent of the electricity used in the greater tokyo area is supplied by nuclear power plants in the niigata and fukushima prefectures   two of those plants  the fukushima dai ichi and fukushima dai ni  were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and have sustained major damage related to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami  rolling blackouts of three hours were expected to last until the end of april      and affected the tokyo  kanagawa  shizuoka  yamanashi  chiba  ibaraki  saitama  tochigi  and gunma prefectures       rolling blackouts began nation wide in pakistan in early      with the resurgence of democracy and presently continue in         it intensifies in the long summers  with many places around the country having no electricity for    hours per day  according to pakistan electric power company  pepco   pakistan s electricity shortfall is normally       megawatts  mw  but reaches around       mw or more during the summer season    the country s electricity problems are so severe that violent riots sometimes take place in some regions  including punjab  the country s most populous province       rolling blackouts  or loadshedding  were practiced in poland during the economic crises of               on several occasions in the     s and     s  trade union strikes in ireland s power utility  the electricity supply board  esb   led to rolling blackouts  however  rolling blackouts have not occurred for this reason since       for such eventualities  the esb have a zone rota system in place  the country is divided into regions which in turn are subdivided into zones  referred to by the letter codes a  b  c  x  y  and z  during periods when blackouts may occur  advertisements are placed in the national newspapers informing customers which region and zone they are in  and at what times of the day they have a high  moderate or low risk of supply interruption   customers fortunate enough to live close to a hospital may find they are on a  priority line  and do not lose power at all   the authorities appeal to the public to conserve electricity  especially during hours of peak demand   however  if and when electricity demand exceeds available supply  supply is cut in some or all of the  high risk  zones  if there is still a shortfall once all the high risk zones have had power cut  then the  moderate risk  zones start experiencing power cuts  the level of risk in each zone changes every three hours moving from  low  to  moderate  to  high  and back to  low      nepal is the second richest country in the world in terms of water resources  although nepal has a very large potential for hydro power generation  it experiences very severe rolling blackouts  nepal has approximately        mw of economically feasible hydro power potential but has been able to generate about      mw approx  of energy popularly known as  load shedding   the country experiences rolling blackouts throughout the entire year  during the winter months  daily power cuts average around       hours a day usually in   to   scheduled time slots  however  power cuts rarely happen according to schedule outside of the capital city of kathmandu  during the summer and monsoon months  may   oct   power cuts are reduced to an average of       hours a day  low investment in power generation  high levels of corruption  and political turmoil have resulted in one of the most severe power shortages in the world     due to unplanned shutdown  rolling blackouts are implemented by national grid corporation of the philippines  ngcp  in mindanao during the electrical power crisis until     citation needed     there is a long history of rolling blackouts in south africa  with multiple causes  in south africa the major producer and distributor of electricity is eskom  which provides over     of the country s energy usage  during the     s eskom mothballed three of their coal fired power stations  as there was an excess of generation capacity at the time  with the demise of apartheid in the     s came massive investment and economic growth  at the same time the government tried to deregulate the electricity supply industry by inviting the private sector to build new power stations to meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity  eskom was at the time prevented from building new power stations  including de mothballing the three existing power stations  or from strengthening the transmission network  the transmission network is especially important in delivering power from mpumalanga  where the majority of the power stations are located  to other parts of the country such as kwazulu natal and the western cape  with no bidders coming forward to construct new power stations  there was effectively no investment into new generation plants during the early     s  which eventually led to the shortage of capacity that was experienced in the     s     in       the department of minerals and energy released a detailed energy review in which it explicitly warned that unless  timely steps were taken to ensure that demand does not exceed available supply capacity   generating capacity would reach its limit by            the energy consumed by the western and northern cape are only partially supplied by koeberg nuclear power station  with the balance of the energy supplied by the coal fired power stations in mpumalanga via the transmission network  in december       a bolt left in koeberg unit   reactor after maintenance caused extensive damage to the rotor  resulting in tripping it out  consequently  there was insufficient power to supply the cape  with the transmission network only partially able to supply the electricity demand  as a result  rolling blackouts were implemented across the two provinces     the blackouts and the accompanying brouhaha in the media resulted in eskom and the government announcing a number of plans for new power stations  and eskom started returning mothballed power stations to service as well as expediting plans to build new gas fired power stations to support the western cape supply     with the freeze on any new developments being placed on eskom during the early     s  south africa was faced with a situation where for the next few years the electricity demand kept rising  without any new power stations being built to keep up the necessary supply  by october      the situation had deteriorated to such an extent that eskom implemented rolling blackouts throughout the country  blackouts occurred in most suburbs throughout the country for a period of two hours at a time     the situation came to a head on    january      when the national grid was brought to near collapse  multiple trips at a number of different power stations rapidly reduced the available supply  resulting in eskom declaring force majeure   and instructing its largest industrial customers  mainly gold and platinum mining companies  to shut down their operations and reduce consumption to  minimal levels   just sufficient to evacuate workers that were still in the mines       in january       with no short  or medium term relief available to ease the power shortages  eskom warned the public that the country s electricity demand would exceed the supply until       when the first new power stations would be brought online      eskom also began recommissioning older power stations which had been mothballed in earlier decades       load shedding was reintroduced in early november       the majuba power plant lost its capacity to generate power after a collapse of one of its coal storage silos on   november       the majuba power plant delivered approximately     of the country s entire capacity and the collapse halted the delivery of coal to the plant    a second silo developed a major crack on    november causing the shut down of the plant again  this was after temporary measures were instated to deliver coal to the plant       on   december  eskom launched a major stage three load shedding in south africa after the shut down of two power plants on thursday   november      due to diesel shortages  it was also reported that the palmiet and drakenburg stations were also experiencing difficulties due to a depletion of water reserve to the hydro plants    on thursday   november  eskom fell      mw short of the electricity countries demand of       mw  the power utility has the ability to produce       mw  but could only supply       mw due to  planned and unplanned  maintenance  one turbine at eskom s duvha power station is also currently out of commission due to an  unexplained incident  in march            in january      tajikistan faced its coldest winter in    years  and the country s energy grid began to fail  by february      tajikstan s energy grid was near collapse and there were blackouts in most of the country  hospitals throughout the country were on limited electricity use  and nurses and doctors were forced to keep newborn babies warm with hot water bottles  there were reports of newborns freezing to death  the un reported that with so much energy required to keep warm there was a danger of people starving to death         lack of coal for ukraine s coal fired power stations due to the war in donbass and a shut down one of the six reactors of the zaporizhia nuclear power plant lead to rolling blackouts throughout ukraine from early till late december            the three day week of january to march       introduced to limit electricity consumption  and thus conserve coal supplies which were severely reduced due to industrial action  meant that non essential commercial users were only allowed to consume electricity for three days each week  home electricity supplies were also limited in some areas     in april       parts of texas experienced rolling blackouts due to excessive air conditioner use because of unexpectedly high temperatures  the longest power outage lasted for a period of five hours  affecting areas in the middle to the south of texas citation needed    in february       north and central texas experienced rolling blackouts due to    power plants tripping offline    temperatures ranged between  xa  f and   xa  f  the coldest in    years  the time of the power outages ranged from    minutes to over eight hours  areas affected included bell  bexar  brazos  collin  comal  dallas  delta  denton  el paso  fort bend  guadalupe  harris  hays  hill  hidalgo  hunt  mclennan  montgomery  navarro  palacios  smith  tarrant  travis  webb and williamson counties  as well as some counties in new mexico  including do a ana  otero  and eddy counties       the      and      blackouts were the only two to occur in two decades       though the term did not enter popular use in the u s  until the california electricity crisis of the early     s  outages had indeed occurred previously  the outages were almost always triggered by unusually hot temperatures during the summer  which causes a surge in demand due to heavy use of air conditioning  however  in       taped conversations of enron traders became public  showing that traders were purposely manipulating the supply of electricity to raise energy prices       on    december       shortly before leaving office  governor gray davis officially brought the energy crisis to an end by issuing a proclamation ending the state of emergency he declared on    january       the state of emergency allowed the state to buy electricity for the financially strapped utility companies  the emergency authority allowed davis to order the california energy commission to streamline the application process for new power plants  during that time  california issued licenses to    new power plants  amounting to the addition of        megawatts of electricity production when completed     rolling blackouts were again imposed in late august      in southern california due to the loss of a key transmission line  the transmission line shut itself off because of a faulty sensor     most of california is divided into    power grids  each containing approximately    of electricity customers in the state  creating a total of      the remaining    are placed on a separate grid  where users such as hospitals and police stations are exempt from ever having their power deliberately cut off     in a stage   emergency only a general call for voluntary conservation is issued  while a stage   emergency results in power being temporarily cut off to certain large users  primarily industrial concerns  who have agreed to this arrangement in exchange for lower rates  when a stage   power emergency is declared  electricity to one of the grids is shut off for a fixed period of time  which can range from    minutes to    hours  if after this period of time the stage   emergency still exists  power is restored to this grid but then the next grid in the sequence is blacked out  and so on  until the situation is stabilizedxa   the blackout thus  rolls  from one grid to the next     in some of california cities  each customer s electric bill includes the number of the power grid  from   to     that customer belongs to  this gives customers at least some advance notice of when their electricity might be turned off in the event of a stage   emergency  the grids are set up in such a manner as to ensure that a large percentage of customers in the same neighborhood would not be blacked out concurrently  which could invite looting and other related problems  normal electricity customers can fall within the areas reserved for emergency use  if they are near a hospital or other critical infrastructure   in which case their electric bill will indicate a power grid of    and they will not be affected by rolling blackouts     in many east coast states  such as new york and new jersey    brownouts  rather than rolling blackouts are implemented during power emergencies citation needed in this scenario  instead of the power being cut off altogether to a certain percentage of customers  the voltage is reduced by a certain percentage to all customersxa   the resulting dimming of electric lights being the origin of the term  brownout   brownouts can cause significant damage to unprotected electronic equipment  but usually have no effect  other than reduced performance  on incandescent lights or some types of motors
