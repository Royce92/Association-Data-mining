state of the u s  on january              the name  alaska           had been introduced in the russian colonial period  when it was used to refer to the peninsula  it was derived from an aleut  or unangam idiom  which figuratively refers to the mainland of alaska  literally  it means object to which the action of the sea is directed     it is also known as alyeska  the  great land   an aleut word derived from the same root             alaska has a longer coastline than all the other u s  states combined   it is the only non contiguous u s  state on continental north america  about     miles     xa km  of british columbia  canada  separates alaska from washington  alaska is thus an exclave of the united states  possibly the largest exclave in the world  it is technically part of the

demarcating the various regions of alaska  but there are six widely accepted regions     the most populous region of alaska  containing anchorage  the matanuska susitna valley and the kenai peninsula  rural  mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of southcentral  as well as the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez     also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage  this is the region of alaska closest to the rest of the united states  as such  this was where most of the initial non indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase  the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest  the largest national

and the prudhoe bay oil field    barrow  the northernmost city in the united states  is located here  the northwest arctic area  anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley  is often regarded as being part of this region  however  the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people     more than     small

unimak island  for example  is home to mount shishaldin  which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to        feet       xa m  above the north pacific  it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth  even more symmetrical than japan s mount fuji  the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr  west of anchorage on the mainland  geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia  a

russian settlement in alaska was established in the   th century    according to this hypothesis  in      several koches of semyon dezhnyov s expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement  this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin  who had visited alaska in           and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river  populated by  bearded men  who  pray to the icons   some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river       the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st  gabriel under the

court was headquartered in sitka     for most of alaska s first decade under the united states flag  sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers  they organized a  provisional city government   which was alaska s first municipal government  but not in a legal sense    legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until       and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in          starting in the     s and stretching in some places to the early     s  gold rushes in alaska and the

later  the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in       the alaska statehood committee and alaska s constitutional convention would soon follow  statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes  mostly in the u s  congress but also within alaska  statehood was approved by congress on july          alaska

february            the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues  established by voters in      to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil  largely in anticipation of the recently constructed trans alaska pipeline system  the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the      prudhoe bay lease sale  out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale  which amounted to      million  at once  it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone  it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since  diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund     the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose  the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this  mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation  from its initial principal of           the fund has grown to    xa billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs    most if not all the principal is invested conservatively

small farms catering to restaurants  the hotel and tourist industry  and community supported agriculture     alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners  small farms and farmers  markets in recent years  with the highest percentage increase       in the nation in growth in farmers  markets in       compared to     nationwide    the peony industry has also taken off  as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world  thereby filling a niche in the flower market       alaska  with no counties  lacks county fairs  however  a small assortment of state and local fairs  with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest   are held mostly in the late summer  the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity  and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high profile commercial activities such as carnival rides  concerts and food   alaska grown  is used as an agricultural slogan     alaska has an abundance of seafood  with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific  seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it  many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence  as well as sport  this includes fish taken by hook  net or wheel       hunting for subsistence  primarily caribou  moose  and dall sheep is still common in the state  particularly in remote bush communities  an example of a traditional native food is akutaq  the eskimo ice cream  which can consist of reindeer fat  seal oil  dried fish meat and local berries     alaska s reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula  where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer       most food in alaska is transported into the state from  outside   and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive  in rural areas  subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive  though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline  the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high  because of the terrain and difficult road conditions  which change dramatically  due to varying climate and precipitation changes  the cost of transport can reach as high as     per pound        kg  or more in some remote areas  during the most difficult times  if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions  the cost of delivering a   us gallon     xa l  of milk is about       in many villages where per capita income can be         or less  fuel cost per gallon is routinely        higher than the continental united states average  with only hawaii having higher prices         alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the u s  the state s road system covers a relatively small area of the state  linking the central population centers and the alaska highway  the principal route out of the state through canada  the state capital  juneau  is not accessible by road  only a car ferry  which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system  or building a road connection from haines  the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska     one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel  an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about    miles    xa km  southeast of anchorage at portage  at     miles     xa km   the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until         the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america     built around       the alaska railroad  arr  played a key role in the development of alaska through the   th century  it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska  passing through anchorage  eklutna  wasilla  talkeetna  denali  and fairbanks  with spurs to whittier  palmer and north pole  the cities  towns  villages  and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as  the railbelt   in recent years  the ever improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad s importance in alaska s economy     the railroad played a vital role in alaska s development  moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward  i e   coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage   it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service     the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains  it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country  a stretch of about    miles     xa km  of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road  the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area  until construction of the parks highway in the     s  the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route     in northern southeast alaska  the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada  british columbia and yukon territory   crossing the border at white pass summit  this line is now mainly used by tourists  often arriving by cruise liner at skagway  it was featured in the      bbc television series great little railways     the alaska rail network is not connected to outside  in       the u s  congress authorized   xa million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska  canada  and the lower              alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle     many cities  towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access  the only modes of access involve travel by air  river  or the sea     alaska s well developed state owned ferry system  known as the alaska marine highway  serves the cities of southeast  the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula  the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers  the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham  washington and prince rupert  british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway  the inter island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway     in recent years  cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market  mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and  to a lesser degree  towns along alaska s gulf coast  the population of ketchikan may rise by over        people on many days during the summer  as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock  debarking thousands of passengers     cities not served by road  sea  or river can be reached only by air  foot  dogsled  or snowmachine  accounting for alaska s extremely well developed bush air services an alaskan novelty  anchorage and  to a lesser extent fairbanks  is served by many major airlines  because of limited highway access  air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state  anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism  in            alaska received almost   million visitors        regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide  so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program  alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in state travel with jet service  sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing        s  from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel  nome  kotzebue  dillingham  kodiak  and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities     the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska  penair  and frontier flying service  the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan  the most popular aircraft in use in the state  much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities  the program requires     of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities     many communities have small air taxi services  these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas  perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane  the world s busiest seaplane base is lake hood  located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport  where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers  cargo  and many items from stores and warehouse clubs  in      alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any u s  state       another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled  in modern times  that is  any time after the mid late     s   dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation  various races are held around the state  but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race  a       mile       xa km  trail from anchorage to nome  although the distance varies from year to year  the official distance is set at       miles or      xa km   the race commemorates the famous      serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much needed medicine to the diphtheria stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed  mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash  prizes  and prestige  the  serum run  is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous      relay  leaving from the community of nenana  southwest of fairbanks  to nome       in areas not served by road or rail  primary transportation in summer is by all terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or  snow machine   as it is commonly referred to in alaska     alaska s internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies  gci and alaska communications  gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system   and as of late      alaska communications advertised that it has  two fiber optic paths to the lower    and two more across alaska    in january       it was reported that a    billion project to run connect asia and rural alaska was being planned  aided in part by      million in stimulus from the federal government       like all other u s  states  alaska is governed as a republic  with three branches of government  an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and the other independently elected constitutional officers  a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate  and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts     the state of alaska employs approximately        people statewide       the alaska legislature consists of a    member house of representatives and a    member senate  senators serve four year terms and house members two  the governor of alaska serves four year terms  the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries  but during the general election  the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket     alaska s court system has four levels  the alaska supreme court  the alaska court of appeals  the superior courts and the district courts    the superior and district courts are trial courts  superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction  while district courts only hear certain types of cases  including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to                the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts  the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower court decisions  including those regarding criminal prosecutions  juvenile delinquency  and habeas corpus    the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals       although in its early years of statehood alaska was a democratic state  since the early     s it has been characterized as republican leaning    local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development  fishing  tourism  and individual rights  alaska natives  while organized in and around their communities  have been active within the native corporations  these have been given ownership over large tracts of land  which require stewardship     alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in one s home was completely legal under state law  though the federal law remains in force       the state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the united states  with the alaskan independence party       six republicans and four democrats have served as governor of alaska  in addition  republican governor wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in      after leaving the republican party and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected  he subsequently officially rejoined the republican party in          alaska s voter initiative making marijuana legal takes effect    february       placing alaska alongside colorado and washington as the three u s  states where recreational marijuana is legal  the new law means people over age    can consume small amounts of pot   if they can find it  it s still illegal to sell marijuana        to finance state government operations  alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies  this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states    it is one of five states with no state sales tax  one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax  and one of the two states that has neither  the department of revenue tax division   reports regularly on the state s revenue sources  the department also issues an annual summary of its operations  including new state laws that directly affect the tax division     while alaska has no state sales tax     municipalities collect a local sales tax  from           typically       other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes  hotel  motel  and bed and breakfast  bed  taxes  severance taxes  liquor and tobacco taxes  gaming  pull tabs  taxes  tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes  a part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees  such as petroleum  aviation motor fuel  telephone cooperative  is shared with municipalities in alaska     fairbanks has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the fairbanks north star borough  fnsb   a sales tax for the fnsb has been voted on many times  but has yet to be approved  leading law makers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco     in      the tax foundation ranked alaska as having the fourth most  business friendly  tax policy  behind only wyoming  south dakota  and nevada       alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood  republicans have won the state s electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in         no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times  alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon b  johnson during his landslide election in       while the      and      elections were close  since       however  republicans have carried the state by large margins  in       republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska         to         mccain s running mate was sarah palin  the state s governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket  obama lost alaska again in       but he captured     of the state s vote in that election  making him the first democrat to do so since          the alaska bush  central juneau  midtown and downtown anchorage  and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party  the matanuska susitna borough  the majority of fairbanks  including north pole and the military base   and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing  as of     update  well over half of all registered voters have chosen  non partisan  or  undeclared  as their affiliation    despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters     because of its population relative to other u s  states  alaska has only one member in the u s  house of representatives  this seat is held by republican don young  who was re elected to his   st consecutive term in       alaska s at large congressional district is one of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the world     in       governor sarah palin became the first republican woman to run on a national ticket when she became john mccain s running mate  she continued to be a prominent national figure even after resigning from the governor s job in july            alaska s united states senators belong to class   and class    in       democrat mark begich  mayor of anchorage  defeated long time republican senator ted stevens  stevens had been convicted on seven felony counts of failing to report gifts on senate financial discloser forms one week before the election  the conviction was set aside in april      after evidence of prosecutorial misconduct emerged     republican frank murkowski held the state s other senatorial position  after being elected governor in       he resigned from the senate and appointed his daughter  state representative lisa murkowski as his successor  she won full six year terms in      and          bill walker  governor    byron mallott  lieutenant governor    lisa murkowski  senior united states senator    dan sullivan  junior united states senator    don young  at large united states representative    alaska is not divided into counties  as most of the other u s  states  but it is divided into boroughs  many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaska s    boroughs  which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states  however  unlike county equivalents in the other    states  the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state  the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough     the unorganized borough has no government of its own  but the u s  census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into    census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation  a recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in alaska  the state is divided into    recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder  all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria  fee schedule  etc   for accepting documents into the public record     whereas many u s  states use a three tiered system of decentralization state county township most of alaska uses only two tiers state borough  owing to the low population density  most of the land is located in the unorganized borough  as the name implies  it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government  in              of alaska s area has this status  with        of the population     anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in      to form the municipality of anchorage  containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river  chugiak  peters creek  girdwood  bird  and indian  fairbanks has a separate borough  the fairbanks north star borough  and municipality  the city of fairbanks      the state s most populous city is anchorage  home to         people in               of whom live in the urbanized area  the richest location in alaska by per capita income is halibut cove            yakutat city  sitka  juneau  and anchorage are the four largest cities in the u s  by area     as reflected in the      united states census  alaska has a total of     incorporated cities and census designated places  cdps   the tally of cities includes four unified municipalities  essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city county  the majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as  the bush  and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network  the table at the bottom of this section lists the     largest cities and census designated places in alaska  in population order     of alaska s      census population figure of                 people  or       of the population  did not live in an incorporated city or census designated place  approximately three quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan  kodiak  palmer and wasilla  cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau  except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikan area neighborhoods in the      census  clover pass  herring cove  ketchikan east  mountain point  north tongass highway  pennock island and saxman east   but have not been used since  the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska  both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough  in largely remote areas     the alaska department of education and early development administers many school districts in alaska  in addition  the state operates a boarding school  mt  edgecumbe high school in sitka  and provides partial funding for other boarding schools  including nenana student living center in

diverse as information technology  welding  nursing  and mechanics     alaska has had a problem with a  brain drain   many of its young people  including most of the highest academic achievers  leave the state after high school graduation and do not return  as of     update  alaska did not have a law school or medical school     the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four year scholarships to the top     of alaska high school graduates  via the alaska scholars program        the alaska state troopers are alaska s statewide police force  they have a long and storied history  but were not an official organization until       before the force was officially organized  law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies  larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on  public safety officers  who have police training but do not carry firearms  in much of the state  the troopers serve as the only police force available  in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law  wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations  due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers  duties  they employ a wide variety of land  air  and water patrol vehicles     many rural communities in alaska are considered  dry   having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages     suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban        domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state  this is in part linked to alcohol abuse     alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation  especially in rural areas  the average age of sexually assaulted victims is    years old  in four out of five cases  the suspects were relatives  friends or acquaintances
