 in computing  a pizza box is a style of case for computers or network switches  cases of this type tend to be wide and flat  normally one or two rack units   u or  u     or    inch      or    xa cm  in height  thus resembling pizza delivery boxes     the data general aviion unix server was advertised in      with the tagline  who just fit mainframe power in a pizza box     but most computers generally referred to as pizza box systems were high end desktop systems such as sun microsystems workstations sold in the     s  most notably the sparcstationxa   and sparcstationxa    other notable examples have been among the highest performing desktop computers of their generations  including the sgixa indy  the nextstation  and the amiga       but the form factor was also seen in budget and lower end lines such as the macintoshxa lc series     the original sparcstationxa   design included an expansion bus technology  sbus  expressly designed for the form factor  expansion cards were small  especially in comparison to other expansion cards in use at the time such as vmebus  and were mounted horizontally instead of vertically  pc compatible computers in this type of case typically use the pci expansion bus and are usually either a xa limited to one or two horizontally placed expansion cards or b xa require special low profile expansion cards  shorter than the pcixa cards regular pcs use      the density of computing power and stackability of pizza box systems also made them attractive for use in data centers  systems originally designed for desktop use were placed on shelves inside of    inch racks  sometimes requiring that part of their cases be cut off in order for them to fit  since the latexa     s  pizza boxes have been a common form factor in data centers or industrial applications where rack space and density are critical  servers in this form factor  as well as higher end ethernet switches  are now designed for rack mounting  rack mount  u computers come in all types of configurations and depths     the pizza box form factor for smaller desktop systems and thin clients remains in use  though it is increasingly being superseded by designs that embed the already size reduced computer into the keyboard or display monitor
