 eucalyptus is a free and open source computer software for building amazon web services  aws  compatible private and hybrid cloud computing environments marketed by the company eucalyptus systems  eucalyptus is the acronym for elastic utility computing architecture for linking your programs to useful systems   eucalyptus enables pooling compute  storage  and network resources that can be dynamically scaled up or down as application workloads change  eucalyptus systems announced a formal agreement with aws in march      to maintain compatibility   m rten mickos is the ceo of eucalyptus   in september       eucalyptus was acquired by hewlett packard             the software development had its roots in the virtual grid application development software project  at rice university and other institutions from      to        rich wolski led a group at the university of california  santa barbara  and became the chief technical officer at the company headquartered in goleta  california before returning to teach at ucsb      eucalyptus software was included in the ubuntu      distribution in       the company was formed in      with      million in funding by benchmark capital to commercialize the software      the co founders of eucalyptus were dr  rich wolski  cto   dr  dan nurmi  dr  neil soman  dr  dmitrii zagorodnov  chris grzegorczyk  graziano obertelli and woody rollins  ceo      eucalyptus commands can manage either amazon or eucalyptus instances  users can also move instances between a eucalyptus private cloud and the amazon elastic compute cloud to create a hybrid cloud  hardware virtualization isolates applications from computer hardware details      eucalyptus uses the terminology      eucalyptus has six components         organizations can use or reuse aws compatible tools  images  and scripts to manage their own on premise infrastructure as a service  iaas  environments  the aws api is implemented on top of eucalyptus  so tools in the cloud ecosystem that can communicate with aws can use the same api with eucalyptus  in march       amazon web services and eucalyptus announced details of the compatibility between aws and eucalyptus  as part of this agreement  aws will support eucalyptus as they continue to extend compatibility with aws apis and customer use cases  customers can run applications in their existing data centers that are compatible with amazon web services such as amazon elastic compute cloud  ec   and amazon simple storage service  s        in june        eucalyptus     was released  featuring a new series of aws compatible tools  these include     eucalyptus     is also the first private cloud platform to support netflix s open source tools   including chaos monkey  asgard  and edda   through its api fidelity with aws          the eucalyptus user console provides an interface for users to self service provision and configure compute  network  and storage resources  development and test teams can manage virtual instances using built in key management and encryption capabilities  access to virtual instances is available using familiar ssh and rdp mechanisms  virtual instances with application configuration can be stopped and restarted using encrypted boot from ebs capability     iaas service components cloud controller  cluster controller  walrus  storage controller  and vmware broker are configurable as redundant systems that are resilient to multiple types of failures  management state of the cloud machine is preserved and reverted to normal operating conditions in the event of a hardware or software failure     eucalyptus can run multiple versions of windows and linux virtual machine images  users can build a library of eucalyptus machine images  emis  with application metadata that are decoupled from infrastructure details to allow them to run on eucalyptus clouds  amazon machine images are also compatible with eucalyptus clouds  vmware images and vapps can be converted to run on eucalyptus clouds and aws public clouds     eucalyptus user identity management can be integrated with existing microsoft active directory or ldap systems to have fine grained role based access control over cloud resources     eucalyptus supports storage area network devices to take advantage of storage arrays to improve performance and reliability  eucalyptus machine images can be backed by ebs like persistent storage volumes  improving the performance of image launch time and enabling fully persistent virtual machine instances  eucalyptus also supports direct attached storage     eucalyptus     offers new features for aws compatibility  these include resource tagging  which allows application developers and cloud administrators to assign customizable metadata tags to resources such as firewalls  load balancers  web servers  and individual workloads to better identify them  eucalyptus     also supports an expanded set of instance types to more closely align to instance types in amazon ec      eucalyptus     also includes a new maintenance mode that allows cloud administrators to perform maintenance on eucalyptus clouds with zero downtime to instances or cloud applications  it also includes new user console features such as a magic search bar  and an easy option to allow users to change their password         eucalyptus      released on october           added new features including improved image management and migration tools  capabilities for warm upgrades  a hybrid cloud user console to manage both eucalyptus and aws resources  identity and access management  iam  roles  and improved high availability  ha  capabilities
