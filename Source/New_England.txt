 new england is a region of the northeastern united states consisting of the six states of connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island and vermont  new england is bordered by new york to the west  long island sound to the south  the atlantic ocean and the canadian province of new brunswick to the east  and the canadian province of quebec to the north     in one of the earliest english settlements in north america  pilgrims from england first settled in new england in       to form plymouth colony  ten years later  the puritans settled north of plymouth colony in boston  thus forming massachusetts bay colony  over the next     years  new england fought in four french and indian wars  until the british and their iroquois confederacy allies defeated the french and their algonquin allies in north america     in the late   th century  the new england colonies initiated the resistance to the british parliament s efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists  the boston tea party was a protest to which great britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping massachusetts of self government  which were termed the  intolerable acts  by the colonists  the confrontation led to open warfare in       the expulsion of the british authorities from new england in spring       and the declaration of independence in july          some of the first movements of american literature  philosophy  and education originated in new england  the region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery  and was the first region of the united states transformed by the industrial revolution  today  new england is a major world center of education  high technology  insurance  and medicine  boston is its cultural  financial  educational  medical  and transportation center     each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as towns  which are often governed by town meetings  the only unincorporated area in new england exists in the sparse  northern regions of vermont  new hampshire  and maine  since       voters have more often supported liberal candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the united states     new england is the only one of the united states census bureau s nine regional divisions whose name does not derive from its geography  and it is the only multi state region with clear  consistent boundaries  it maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country although the terms of this identity are often contested  combining puritanism with liberalism  agrarian life with industry  and isolation with immigration     the earliest known inhabitants of new england were american indians who spoke a variety of the eastern algonquian languages   prominent tribes included the abenaki  penobscot  pequot  mohegans  narragansett indians  pocumtuck  and wampanoag   prior to the arrival of europeans  the western abenakis inhabited new hampshire  new york  and vermont  as well as parts of quebec and western maine   their principal town was norridgewock  in present day maine      the penobscot lived along the penobscot river in maine  the wampanoag occupied southeastern massachusetts  rhode island  and the islands of martha s vineyard and nantucket  the pocumtucks lived in western massachusetts  and the mohegan and pequot tribes in the connecticut region  the connecticut river valley  which includes parts of vermont  new hampshire  massachusetts and connecticut  linked different indigenous communities culturally  linguistically  and politically      as early as       french  dutch  and english traders  exploring the new world  began to trade metal  glass  and cloth for local beaver pelts       on april           king james i of england issued a charter for each of the virginia companies  london and plymouth  these were privately funded ventures  intended to claim land for england  conduct trade  and return a profit  in       plymouth in massachusetts was settled by pilgrims from the mayflower  beginning the history of permanent european settlement in new england      in       english explorer john smith named the region  new england    the name was officially sanctioned on november            when the charter of the virginia company of plymouth was replaced by a royal charter for the plymouth council for new england  a joint stock company established to colonize and govern the region    as the first colonists arrived in plymouth  they wrote and signed the mayflower compact    their first governing document    the massachusetts bay colony  which would come to dominate the area  was established by royal charter in          with its major town and port of boston established in            massachusetts puritans began to settle in connecticut as early as         roger williams  banished from massachusetts for heresy  led a group south  and founded providence  in the area that later became the state of rhode island  in           at this time  vermont was yet unsettled  and the territories of new hampshire and maine were claimed and governed by massachusetts       relationships between colonists and native americans alternated between peace and armed skirmishes  the bloodiest of which was the pequot war in       which resulted in the mystic massacre    on may           the colonies of massachusetts bay  plymouth  new haven  and connecticut joined together in a loose compact called the new england confederation  officially  the united colonies of new england    the confederation was designed largely to coordinate mutual defense  and gained some importance during king philip s war    from june      through april       king philip s war pitted the colonists and their native american allies against a widespread native american uprising  resulting in killings and massacres on both sides       during the next    years  there were six colonial wars that took place primarily between new england and new france  see the french and indian wars as well as father rale s war and father le loutre s war   throughout these wars  new england was allied with the iroquois confederacy and new france was allied with the wabanaki confederacy  after the new england conquest of acadia in       mainland nova scotia was under the control of new england  but both present day new brunswick and virtually all of present day maine remained contested territory between new england and new france  after the british won the war in       the connecticut river valley was opened for british settlement into western new hampshire and what is today vermont     the new england colonies were settled largely by farmers  who became relatively self sufficient  later  aided by the puritan work ethic  new england s economy began to focus on crafts and trade  in contrast to the southern colonies  which focused on agricultural production while importing finished goods from england       by       king james ii had become concerned about the increasingly independent ways of the colonies  including their self governing charters  their open flouting of the navigation acts  and their growing military power  he therefore established the dominion of new england  an administrative union comprising all of the new england colonies    in       the former dutch colonies of new york  east new jersey  and west new jersey were added to the dominion  the union  imposed from the outside and contrary to the rooted democratic tradition of the region  was highly unpopular among the colonists       the dominion significantly modified the charters of the colonies  including the appointment of royal governors to nearly all of them  there was an uneasy tension between the royal governors  their officers  and the elected governing bodies of the colonies  the governors wanted unlimited authority  and the different layers of locally elected officials would often resist them  in most cases  the local town governments continued operating as self governing bodies  just as they had before the appointment of the governors       after the glorious revolution in       bostonians overthrew the royal governor  sir edmund andros  they seized dominion officials and adherents to the church of england during a popular and bloodless uprising    these tensions eventually culminated in the american revolution  boiling over with the outbreak of the war of american independence in       the first battles of the war were fought in lexington and concord  massachusetts  later leading to the siege of boston by continental troops  in march       british forces were compelled to retreat from boston     after the war of independence  new england ceased to be a meaningful political unit  but remained a defined cultural region consisting of its now sovereign constituent states  by       all of the states in the region had taken steps towards the abolition of slavery  with vermont and massachusetts introducing total abolition in      and       respectively    the nickname  yankeeland  was sometimes used to denote the new england area  especially among southerners and british       during the war of       there was a movement within new england for secession from the united states as new england merchants  only beginning to recover  opposed war with their greatest trading partner great britain    delegates met in the hartford convention in the winter of          the twenty seven delegates met to discuss changes to the u s  constitution to protect the region s interests and maintain its political power  feeling used as pawns in the focus on trade restrictions       after settling a dispute with new york  vermont was admitted to statehood in       formally completing the defined area of new england  on march           as part of the missouri compromise  the territory of maine  formerly a part of massachusetts  was admitted to the union as a free state    today  new england is defined as made up of the six states of connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island  and vermont       for the rest of the period before the american civil war  new england remained distinct from the rest of the u s  politically  it often disagreed with the rest of the country    massachusetts and connecticut were among the last refuges of the federalist party  and  when the second party system began in the     s  new england became the strongest bastion of the new whig party  the whigs were usually dominant throughout new england  except in the more democratic maine and new hampshire  leading statesmen including daniel webster hailed from the region  new england was distinct in other ways  many notable literary and intellectual figures produced by the united states before the american civil war were new englanders  including ralph waldo emerson  henry david thoreau  nathaniel hawthorne  henry wadsworth longfellow  john greenleaf whittier  george bancroft  and william h  prescott       new england was key to the industrial revolution in the u s    the blackstone valley  running through massachusetts and rhode island  has been called the birthplace of america s industrial revolution    in       the first cotton mill in america  the beverly cotton manufactory  was founded in the north shore seaport of beverly  massachusetts    the manufactory was also considered the largest cotton mill of its time  technological developments and achievements from the manufactory led to the development of more advanced cotton mills  including slater mill in pawtucket  rhode island  towns such as lawrence and lowell in massachusetts  woonsocket in rhode island  and lewiston in maine became centers of the textile industry following the innovations at slater mill and the beverly cotton manufactory     the rapid growth of textile manufacturing in new england between      and      caused a shortage of workers  recruiters were hired by mill agents to bring young women and children from the countryside to work in the factories  between      and       thousands of farm girls such as the famous lowell mill girls moved from rural areas where there was no paid employment to work in the nearby mills  as the textile industry grew  immigration also grew  by the     s  immigrants  especially irish and french canadians  began working in the mills       new england was  as a whole  the most industrialized part of the young united states  by       it accounted for well over a quarter of all manufacturing value in the country  and over a third of its industrial workforce    it was also the most literate and most educated region in the country       during the same period  new england and areas settled by new englanders  upstate new york  ohio s western reserve  and the upper midwestern states of michigan and wisconsin  were the center of the strongest abolitionist and anti slavery movements in the united states  coinciding with the protestant great awakening in the region    abolitionists who demanded immediate emancipation such as william lloyd garrison  john greenleaf whittier and wendell phillips had their base in the region  so too did anti slavery politicians who wanted to limit the growth of slavery  such as john quincy adams  charles sumner  and john p  hale  when the anti slavery republican party was formed in the     s  all of new england  including areas that had previously been strongholds for both the whig and the democratic parties  became strongly republican  new england remained solidly republican until catholics began to mobilize behind the democrats  especially in          the flow of immigrants continued at a steady pace from the     s until cut off by world war i  the largest numbers came from ireland and britain before       and after that from quebec  italy and southern europe  the immigrants filled the ranks of factory workers  craftsmen and unskilled laborers  the irish assumed a larger and larger role in the democratic parts in the cities and statewide  while the rural areas remained republican  yankees left the farms  which never were highly productive  many headed west  while others became professionals and businessmen in the new england cities     the great depression in the united states of the     s hit the region hard  with high unemployment in the industrial cities  the democrats appealed to factory workers and especially catholics  pulling them into the new deal coalition and making the once republican region into one that was closely divided  however the enormous spending on munitions  ships  electronics  and uniforms during world war ii caused a burst of prosperity in every sector     the region lost most of its factories starting with the loss of textiles starting in the     s and getting worse after       the new england economy was radically transformed after world war ii  the factory economy practically disappeared  the textile mills one by one went out of business from the     s to the     s  for example the crompton company  after     years in business  went bankrupt in       costing the jobs of       workers in five states  the major reasons were cheap imports  the strong dollar  declining exports  and a failure to diversify    shoes followed  what remains is very high technology manufacturing  such as jet engines  nuclear submarines  pharmaceuticals  robotics  scientific instruments  and medical devices  mit  the massachusetts institute of technology  invented the format for university industry relations in high tech fields  and spawned many software and hardware firms  some of which grew rapidly    by the   st century the region had become famous for its leadership roles in the fields of education  medicine and medical research  high technology  finance  and tourism       some industrial areas were slow in adjusting to the new service economy  in       new england had two of the ten poorest cities  by percentage living below the poverty line  in the u s   the state capitals of providence  rhode island and hartford  connecticut    they were no longer in the bottom ten by       connecticut  massachusetts  and new hampshire remain among the ten wealthiest states in the united states in terms of median household income and per capita income       the states of new england have a combined area of         xa sqxa mi         xa km    making the region slightly larger than the state of washington and larger than england      maine alone constitutes nearly one half of the total area of new england  yet is only the   th largest state  slightly smaller than indiana  the remaining states are among the smallest in the u s   including the smallest state  rhode island     new england s long rolling hills  mountains  and jagged coastline are glacial landforms resulting from the retreat of ice sheets approximately        years ago  during the last glacial period         new england is geologically a part of the new england province  an exotic terrane region consisting of the appalachian mountains  the new england highlands  and the seaboard lowlands    the appalachian mountains roughly follow the border between new england and new york  the berkshires in massachusetts and connecticut  and the green mountains in vermont  as well as the taconic mountains  form a spine of precambrian rock       the appalachians extend northwards into new hampshire as the white mountains  and then into maine and canada  mount washington in new

combined statistical area       several factors combine to make the new england economy unique  the region is distant from the geographic center of the country  and is a relatively small region  and relatively densely populated  it historically has been an important center of industrial manufacturing and a supplier of natural resource products  such as granite  lobster  and codfish  new england exports food products  ranging from fish to lobster  cranberries  maine potatoes  and maple syrup  the service industry is important  including tourism  education  financial and insurance services  plus architectural  building  and construction services  the u s  department of commerce has called the new england economy a microcosm for the entire u s  economy       in the first half of the   th century  the region underwent a long period of deindustrialization as traditional manufacturing companies relocated to the midwest  with textile and furniture manufacturing migrating to the south  in the mid to late   th century  an increasing portion of the regional economy included high technology  including computer and electronic equipment manufacturing   military defense industry  finance and insurance services  as well as education and health services     as of       the gdp of new england was        billion       exports consist mostly of industrial products  including specialized machines and weaponry  aircraft and missiles especially   built by the region s educated workforce  about half of the region s exports consist of industrial and commercial machinery  such as computers

and state  and the activities of the individual were severely restricted    though modern new england is noted for its more liberal leanings in national and local elections  its earliest laws and social attitudes were quite the contrary  jews  catholics  and quakers were often targets of persecution and outright banned in the first case  females were considered their husband s property and though  unlike women in several other colonies  they were taught to read  it was mainly to read the bible and nothing else  this contrasts sharply with the strong principles of separation of church and state underlying the foundation of rhode island  providence had no public burial ground and no common until the year          years after its founding  because religious and government institutions were so rigorously kept distinct       a derivative of meetings held by church elders  town meetings were and are an integral part of governance of many new england towns  at such meetings  any citizen of the town may discuss issues with other members of the community and vote on them  this is the strongest example of direct democracy in the u s  today  and the form of dialogue has been adopted under certain circumstances elsewhere  most strongly in the states closest to the region  such as new york  new jersey and pennsylvania citation needed such a strong democratic tradition was even apparent in the early   th century  when alexis de tocqueville wrote in democracy in america    by contrast  james madison wrote in federalist no     that  regardless of the assembly   passion never fails to wrest the scepter from reason  had every athenian citizen been a socrates  every athenian assembly would still have been a mob     the use and effectiveness of town
