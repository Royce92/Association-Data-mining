 in computing  specifically data transmission and data storage   a block  sometimes called a physical record  is a sequence of bytes or bits  usually containing some whole number of records  having a maximum length  a block size   data thus structured are said to be blocked  the process of putting data into blocks is called blocking  while deblocking is the process of extracting data from blocks  blocked data is normally stored in a data buffer and read or written a whole block at a time  blocking reduces the overhead and speeds up the handling of the data stream   for some devices such as magnetic tape and ckd disk devices blocking reduces the amount of external storage required for the data  blocking is almost universally employed when storing data to   track magnetic tape  to rotating media such as floppy disks  hard disks  optical discs and to nand flash memory     most file systems are based on a block device  which is a level of abstraction for the hardware responsible for storing and retrieving specified blocks of data  though the block size in file systems may be a multiple of the physical block size  this leads to space inefficiency due to internal fragmentation  since file lengths are often not integer multiples of block size  and thus the last block of a file may remain partially empty  this will create slack space  which averages half a block per file  some newer file systems attempt to solve this through techniques called block suballocation and tail merging     block storage is normally abstracted by a file system or database management system  dbms  for use by applications and end users  the physical or logical volumes accessed via block i o may be devices internal to a server  directly attached via scsi or fibre channel  or distant devices accessed via a storage area network  san  using a protocol such as iscsi  or aoe  dbmses often use their own block i o for improved performance and recoverability as compared to layering the dbms on top of a file system
