 net metering is a service to an electric consumer under which electric energy generated by that electric consumer from an eligible on site generating facility and delivered to the local distribution facilities may be used to offset electric energy provided by the electric utility to the electric consumer during the applicable billing period      net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province  if net metering is available  if and how long you can keep your banked credits  and how much the credits are worth  retail wholesale   most net metering laws involve monthly roll over of kwh credits  a small monthly connection fee   require monthly payment of deficits  i e  normal electric bill   and annual settlement of any residual credit  unlike a feed in tariff  fit  or time of use metering  tou   net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure  and requires no special metering  or even any prior arrangement or notification      net metering is a policy designed to foster private investment in renewable energy  in the united states  as part of the energy policy act of       all public electric utilities are required to make available upon request net metering to their customers              net metering originated in the united states  where small wind turbines and solar panels were connected to the electrical grid  and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date than when it was generated  minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law  in       and allowed anyone generating less than   xa kw to either roll over any kilowatt credit to the next month  or be paid for the excess  in      this was amended to compensation  at the average retail utility energy rate   this is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering  and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate      utilities in idaho adopted net metering in       and in arizona in       massachusetts adopted net metering in       by          states or utilities therein had adopted net metering  two california utilities initially adopted a monthly  net metering  charge  which included a  standby charge   until the puc banned such charges   in       all u s  utilities were required to offer net metering  upon request   excess generation is not addressed  as of         u s  states have adopted net metering  as well as utilities in   of the remaining states  leaving only   states without any established procedures for implementing net metering      net metering was slow to be adopted in europe  especially in the united kingdom  because of confusion over how to address the value added tax  vat   only one utility company in great britain offers net metering      the united kingdom government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the value added tax that is payable on electricity  but pilot projects are underway in some areas     in canada  some provinces have net metering programs     in the philippines  net metering scheme is governed by republic act       renewable energy act of       and it s implementing rules and regulation  irr   the implementing body is the energy regulatory commission  erc  in consultation with the national renewable energy board  nreb   unfortunately  the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme  as the dept of energy s net metering guidelines say        net metering allows customers of distribution utilities  dus  to install an on site renewable energy  re  facility not exceeding     kilowatts  kw  in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use  any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the du s distribution system  the du then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the du s blended generation cost  excluding other generation adjustments  and deducts the credits earned to the customer s electric bill    https   www doe gov ph netmeteringguide index php   how net metering works understanding the basics of policy regulation and standards     thus philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the  generation cost  which is often less than     of the retail price of electricity     utility companies and trade organizations are seeking to update state net metering policies to make them more transparent and prevent shifting the cost of electric generation  transmission  and distribution systems from net metering customers to customers who cannot afford or are unable to have renewable energy sources  a report prepared by peter kind of energy infrastructure advocates for the trade association edison electric institute stated that distributed generation systems  like rooftop solar  present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities      many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid  thus shifting their share of the cost on to customers without distributed generation systems    most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power       renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities  existing business model  the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs  and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers    grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid they also point out that  as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar  net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis  including  public health benefits  employment and downstream economic effects  market price impacts  grid security benefits  and water savings       a      report on the cost of net metering in the state of california  commissioned by the california public utilities commission  cpuc   showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay      in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by       the report also showed the net cost will amount to us     billion by         notably  the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them  table    page     average      of their cost of service across the three major utilities in             a      report funded by the institute for electric innovation   reveals that net metering in california produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar pv facilities  these subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers  most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar pv customers  in addition  the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies  which accounted for about    percent of the solar pv facilities installed in       the report concludes that changes are needed in california  ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost reflective to replacing net metering with a separate  buy all   sell all  arrangement that requires all rooftop solar pv customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities  respective avoided costs       illustrating the alternative view  an independent report conducted by the consulting firm crossborder energy found that the benefits of california s net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers  those net benefits will amount to more than     million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program       there is considerable confusion between the terms  net metering  and  feed in tariff   in general there are three types of compensation for local  distributed generation     net metering only requires one meter  a feed in tariff requires two     time of use  tou  net metering employs a specialized reversible smart  electric  meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day  time of use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used  i e   day night and seasonal rates   typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period  and low during the night  when usage is low  time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable energy sources  since  for example  solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak price period  and produce little or no power during the night period  when price is low  italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day  but are instead in the evening    tou net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility    smart meter technology can also be used to design residential electricity delivery tariffs on the basis of coincident peak demand rather than usage  this tariff model  while complex  may allow for a more accurate valuation of the economic benefit of distributed generation       in market rate net metering systems the user s energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices  the users  meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely  net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system     market rate metering systems were implemented in california starting in       and under the terms of california s net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems  under california law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the  variable  in this case  price charged at that time     net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time  such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning  or by charging a battery electric vehicle during off peak times  while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally  see vehicle to grid   no credit is given for annual surplus production     excess generation is a separate issue than net metering  but it is normally dealt with in the same rules  because it can arise  if local generation offsets a portion of the demand  net metering is not used  if local generation exceeds demand some of the time  for example during the day  net metering is used  if local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle  best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits  although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after    months  the normal definition of excess generation is annually  although the term is equally applicable monthly  the treatment of annual excess generation  and monthly  ranges from lost  to compensation at avoided cost  to compensation at retail rate    left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate  from the consumer standpoint  and lost  from the utility standpoint  with avoided cost a minimum compromise  some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation    which allows perpetual roll over or payment  at the customers choice  both wind and solar are inherently seasonal  and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later  unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed     in some australian states  the  feed in tariff  is actually net metering  except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail  with environment victoria campaigns director mark wakeham calling it a  fake feed in tariff     a feed in tariff requires a separate meter  and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate  while net metering requires only one meter  the financial differences are very substantial     in victoria  from       householders will be paid    cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this is around three times the current retail price for electricity     in queensland starting in       the solar bonus scheme pays    cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this is around three times the current retail price for electricity     ontario allows net metering for up to    xa kw  however credits can only be carried for    consecutive months  should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for   months and use up the credits in the   th month  then the    month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice  any unused credits remaining at the end of    consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing       areas of british columbia serviced by bc hydro are allowed net metering for up to   xa kw  at each annual anniversary the customer was paid      cents   per kwh  if there is a net export of power after each    month period  which was increased to      cents kwh  effective june          systems over   xa kw are covered under the standing offer program      fortisbc which serves an area in south central bc also allows net metering for up to   xa kw  customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce    the city of new westminster  which has its own electrical utility  does not currently allow net metering     new brunswick allows net metering for installations up to    xa kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until march at which time any excess credits are lost        saskpower allows net metering for installations up to    xa kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customer s annual anniversary date  at which time any excess credits are lost     denmark established net metering for privately owned pv systems in mid      for a pilot period of four years  in      the net metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of       net metering has proved to be a cheap  easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of pv in denmark  however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential  during the political negotiations in the fall of      the net metering for privately owned pv systems was made permanent       italy offers a very attractive support scheme  mixing net metering and a well segmented premium fit       in spain  net metering has been proposed by the asociaci n de la industria fotovoltaica  asif  to promote renewable electricity  without requiring additional economic support       some form of net metering is now proposed by  lectricit  de france  according to their website  energy produced by home owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers  hence  some recommend to sell all energy produced  and buy back all energy needed at a lower price  the price has been fixed for    years by the government         net metering was pioneered in the united states as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed  beginning with utilities in idaho in       and in arizona in        most states have net metering programs  and a      federal law requires all public utilities to offer net metering upon request      several bills have been proposed to institute a federal requirement to set standard limits on net metering  they range from h r      which allows up to    net metering to h r       which has no limit  but does limit residential users to   xa kw  a low limit compared to many states  such as new mexico  with an       xa kw limit  or states such as arizona  colorado  new jersey  and ohio which limit as a percentage of load  best practices recommends limiting only to the customer s service entrance capacity    current law requires all utilities to offer net metering upon request  which implies no limits  and is in conflict with state laws which do set a limit  current as of june         only three states do address net metering  and twenty one have no limit on the number of subscribers using net metering  only three  arizona  new jersey  and ohio  have no specific wattage limit on the power limit for each subscriber  see table   arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  delaware  maryland  massachusetts  new jersey  new york  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  utah  vermont  and west virginia are considered the most favorable states for net metering  as they are the only states to receive an  a  rating from the network for new energy choices in            note  some additional minor variations not listed in this table may apply  n a   not available  lost   excess electricity credit or credit not claimed is granted to utility  retail rate   final sale price of electricity  avoided cost    wholesale  price of electricity  cost to the utility       depending on utility       massachusetts distinguishes policies for different  classes  of systems        only available to customers of austin energy  cps energy  or green mountain energy  green mountain energy is not a utility but a retail electric provider  according to www powertochoose com        indian states of tamil nadu  karnataka  and andhra pradesh have started implementation of net metering  and the policy has been announced by the respective state electricity boards in       feasibility study will be done by the electricity boards  and after inspection the meters will be replaced by bidirectional ones and will be installed  applications are taken up for up to     of the distribution transformer capacity on a first come first serve basis and technical feasibility        net purchase and sale is a different method of providing power to the electricity grid that does not offer the price symmetry of net metering  making this system a lot less profitable for home users of small renewable electricity systems     under this arrangement  two uni directional meters are installed one records electricity drawn from the grid  and the other records excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid  the user pays retail rate for the electricity they use  and the power provider purchases their excess generation at its avoided cost  wholesale rate   there may be a significant difference between the retail rate the user pays and the power provider s avoided cost       germany  spain  ontario  canada   some states in the usa  and other countries  on the other hand  have adopted a price schedule  or feed in tariff  fit   whereby customers get paid for any electricity they generate from renewable energy on their premises  the actual electricity being generated is counted on a separate meter  not just the surplus they feed back to the grid  in germany  for the solar power generated  a feed in tariff is being paid in order to boost solar power  figure from        germany once paid several times the retail rate for solar but has successfully reduced the rates drastically while actual installation of solar has grown exponentially at the same time due to installed cost reductions  wind energy  in contrast  only receives around a half of the domestic retail rate  because the german system pays what each source costs  including a reasonable profit margin      sources that produce direct current  such as solar panels must be coupled with an electrical inverter to convert the output to alternating current  for use with conventional appliances  the phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid  and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure  this is for safetyxa    for example  workers repairing downed power lines must be protected from  downstream  sources  in addition to being disconnected from the main  upstream  distribution grid  note  a small generator simply lacks the power to energize a loaded line  this can only happen if the line is isolated from other loads  and is extremely unlikely  solar inverters are designed for safetyxa    while one inverter could not energize a line  a thousand might  in addition  all electrical workers should treat every line as though it was live  even when they know it should be safe         solar guerrilla  or the guerrilla solar movement  is a term originated by home power magazine and is applied to someone who uses an alternative energy source to illegally supply electricity back to a public utility grid
