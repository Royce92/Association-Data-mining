 in multitasking computer operating systems  a daemon    di m n  or   de m n    is a computer program that runs as a background process  rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user  traditionally daemon names end with the letter d  for example  syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility and sshd is a daemon that services incoming ssh connections     in a unix environment  the parent process of a daemon is often  but not always  the init process  a daemon is usually either created by a process forking a child process and then immediately exiting  thus causing init to adopt the child process  or by the init process directly launching the daemon  in addition  a daemon launched by forking and exiting typically must perform other operations  such as dissociating the process from any controlling terminal  tty   such procedures are often implemented in various convenience routines such as daemon    in unix     systems often start daemons at boot time and serve the function of responding to network requests  hardware activity  or other programs by performing some task  daemons can also configure hardware  like udevd on some gnu linux systems   run scheduled tasks  like cron   and perform a variety of other tasks             the term was coined by the programmers of mit s project mac  they took the name from maxwell s demon  an imaginary being from a famous thought experiment that constantly works in the background  sorting molecules   unix systems inherited this terminology  maxwell s demon is consistent with greek mythology s interpretation of a daemon as a supernatural being working in the background  with no particular bias towards good or evil  however  bsd and some of its derivatives have adopted a christian demon as their mascot rather than a greek daemon citation needed    the word daemon is an alternative spelling of demon   and is pronounced   di m n  dee m n  in the context of computer software  the original pronunciation   di m n  has drifted to   de m n  day m n for some speakers      alternate terms for daemon are service  microsoft windows nt   started task  ibm z os    and ghost job  xds uts      in a strictly technical sense  a unix like system process is a daemon when its parent process terminates and the daemon is assigned the init process  process number    as its parent process and has no controlling terminal  however  more commonly  a daemon may be any background process  whether a child of the init process or not     on a unix like system  the common method for a process to become a daemon  when the process is started from the command line or from a startup script such as an init script or a systemstarter script  involves     if the process is started by a super server daemon  such as inetd  launchd  or systemd  the super server daemon will perform those functions for the process     except for old style daemons not converted to run under systemd and specified as type forking  and  multi threaded  datagram servers under inetd       in the microsoft dos environment  daemon like programs were implemented as terminate and stay resident  tsr  software  on microsoft windows nt systems  programs called windows services perform the functions of daemons  they run as processes  usually do not interact with the monitor  keyboard  and mouse  and may be launched by the operating system at boot time  in windows      and later versions  windows services are configured and manually started and stopped using the control panel  a dedicated control configuration program  the service controller component of the service control manager  sc command   the net start and net stop commands or the powershell scripting system     however  any windows application can perform the role of a daemon  not just a service  and some daemons for windows have the option of running as a normal process     on the original mac os  optional features and services were provided by files loaded at startup time that patched the operating system  these were known as system extensions and control panels  later versions of classic mac os augmented these with fully fledged faceless background applications  regular applications that ran in the background  to the user  these were still described as regular system extensions     os x  which is a unix system  uses daemons   the term  services  is used in os x for software that performs functions selected from the services menu  rather than being used for daemons as in windows      according to fernando j  corbato who worked on project mac in      his team is the first to use the term daemon  the use of the term daemon was inspired by maxwell s demon  an imaginary agent in physics and thermodynamics that helped to sort molecules      we fancifully began to use the word daemon to describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform system chores     in the general sense  daemon is an older form of the word demon  from the greek         in the unix system administration handbook  evi nemeth states the following about daemons      many people equate the word  daemon  with the word  demon   implying some kind of satanic connection between unix and the underworld  this is an egregious misunderstanding   daemon  is actually a much older form of  demon   daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil  but rather serve to help define a person s character or personality  the ancient greeks  concept of a  personal daemon  was similar to the modern concept of a  guardian angel  eudaemonia is the state of being helped or protected by a kindly spirit  as a rule  unix systems seem to be infested with both daemons and demons   p         a further characterization of the mythological symbolism is that a daemon is something which is not visible yet is always present and working its will  plato s socrates describes his own personal daemon to be something like the modern concept of a moral conscience      the favour of the gods has given me a marvelous gift  which has never left me since my childhood  it is a voice which  when it makes itself heard  deters me from what i am about to do and never urges me on
