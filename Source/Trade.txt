calculation made was whether it was in any particular country s self interest to open its borders to imports     john stuart mill proved that a country with monopoly pricing power on the international market could manipulate the terms of trade through maintaining tariffs  and that the response to this might be reciprocity in trade policy  ricardo and others had suggested this earlier  this was taken as evidence against the universal doctrine of free trade  as it was believed that more of the economic surplus of trade would accrue to a country following reciprocal  rather than completely free  trade policies  this was followed within a few years by the infant industry scenario developed by mill promoting the theory that government had the  duty  to protect young industries  although only for a time necessary for them to develop full capacity  this became the policy in many countries attempting to industrialise and out compete english exporters  milton friedman later continued
