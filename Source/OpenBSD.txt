 openbsd is a unix like computer operating system descended from berkeley software distribution  bsd   a research unix derivative developed at the university of california  berkeley  it was forked from netbsd by project leader theo de raadt in late       as well as the operating system  the openbsd project has produced portable versions of numerous subsystems  most notably pf  openssh and openntpd  which are very widely available as packages in other operating systems     the project is also widely known for the developers  insistence on open source code and quality documentation  uncompromising position on software licensing  and focus on security and code correctness  the project is coordinated from de raadt s home in calgary  alberta  canada  its logo and mascot is a pufferfish named puffy     openbsd includes a number of security features absent or optional in other operating systems  and has a tradition in which developers audit the source code for software bugs and security problems  the project maintains strict policies on licensing and prefers the open source bsd licence and its variants  in the past this has led to a comprehensive license audit and moves to remove or replace code under licences found less acceptable     as with most other bsd based operating systems  the openbsd kernel and userland programs  such as the shell and common tools like cat and ps  are developed together in one source code repository  third party software is available as binary packages or may be built from source using the ports tree  also like most modern bsd operating systems  it is capable of running binary code compiled for linux in a compatible computer architecture at full speed in compatibility mode     the openbsd project maintains ports for    different hardware platforms  including the dec alpha  intel i     hewlett packard pa risc  x      and motorola       processors  apple s powerpc machines  sun sparc and sparc   based computers  the vax and the sharp zaurus   the openbsd foundation was accepted as a mentoring organization for google summer of code                    openbsd s security enhancements  built in cryptography and the pf packet filter suit it for use in the security industry  for example on firewalls   intrusion detection systems and vpn gateways     proprietary systems from several manufacturers are based on openbsd  including devices from armorlogic  profense web application firewall   calyptix security  genua mbh  rtmx inc   and  vantronix gmbh   later versions of microsoft s services for unix  an extension to the windows operating system which provides some unix like functionality  use much openbsd code included in the interix interoperability suite  developed by softway systems inc   which microsoft acquired in          core force  a security product for windows  is based on openbsd s pf firewall       openbsd ships with the x window system   and is suitable for use on the desktop    packages for popular desktop tools are available  including desktop environments gnome  kde  and xfce  web browsers konqueror  mozilla firefox and chromium  and multimedia programs mplayer  vlc media player and xine    the project also supports minimalist window management philosophies by including the cwm stacking window manager and fvwm in the main distribution     open source software consultancy  m tier  has deployed openbsd on servers  desktops and firewalls in corporate environments of many fortune     companies       openbsd features a full server suite and is easily configured as a mail server  web server  ftp server  dns server  router  firewall  or nfs file server  software providing support for other server protocols such as smb  samba  are available as packages     despite the small team size and relatively low usage of openbsd  the project has successfully spun off widely available portable versions of numerous parts of the base system  including     some of the subsystems have been integrated into the core system of several other bsd projects  and all are available widely as packages for use in other unix like systems  and in some cases in microsoft windows     in       for openbsd     and      the fork of apache     was removed from the base system  with plans to remove nginx  they were replaced with httpd     an http server with fastcgi and transport layer security support based on the relayd    source code  apache and nginx will be installed from packages in     and        portable versions of httpd and relayd have not yet been released     development is continuous  and team management is open and tiered  anyone with appropriate skills may contribute  with commit rights being awarded on merit and de raadt acting as coordinator    two official releases are made per year  with the version number incremented by        and these are each supported for twelve months  snapshot releases are also available at very frequent intervals  maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied manually or by regularly updating the system against the patch branch of the cvs repository for that release     alternatively a system administrator may opt to upgrade using a snapshot release and then regularly update the system against the  current  branch of the cvs repository  in order to gain pre release access to recently added features     the standard generic openbsd kernel  as maintained by the project  is strongly recommended for universal use  and customized kernels are not supported by the project  in line with the philosophy that  attempts to customize or  optimize  the kernel causes more problems than they solve      packages outside the main system build are maintained by cvs through a ports tree and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers  known as porters   as well as keeping the current branch up to date  the porter of a package is expected to apply appropriate bug fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of the package for supported releases  ports are not subject to the same continuous rigorous auditing as the main system because the project lacks the manpower to do this     binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture  this process is applied for the current version  for each supported release  and for each snapshot  administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree  unless they need to perform their own source changes     openbsd s developers regularly comes together from all around the world and organize an special event called  hackathon   in hackathons  the developers  sit down and code   implementing their ideas about the project and get things done more rapidly than usual       with every new release a song is also released       in december       netbsd co founder theo de raadt was asked to resign from his position as a senior developer and member of the netbsd core team    the reason for this is not wholly clear  although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the netbsd project and on its mailing lists       in october       de raadt founded openbsd  a new project forked from netbsd      the initial release  openbsd      was made in july       followed in october of the same year by openbsd        since then  the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months  each of which is maintained and supported for one year  the latest release  openbsd      appeared on   november          on    july       openbsd developer bob beck announced the formation of the openbsd foundation    a canadian not for profit corporation formed to  act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support openbsd        just how widely openbsd is used is hard to ascertain  its developers neither publish nor collect usage statistics  and there are few other sources of information  in september       the nascent bsd certification group performed a usage survey which revealed that       of bsd users       of      respondents  were using openbsd    placing it second of the four major bsd variants  behind freebsd with     and ahead of netbsd with             the openbsd project is noted for its high quality user documentation  considered top among the bsd family operating systems  all of which have excellent documentation      when openbsd was created  theo de raadt decided that the source should be easily available for anyone to read at any time  so  with the assistance of chuck cranor    he set up a public  anonymous cvs server  this was the first of its kind in the software development world  at the time  the tradition was for only a small team of developers to have access to a project s source repository    cranor and de raadt concluded that this practice  runs counter to the open source philosophy  and is inconvenient to contributors  de raadt s decision allowed  users to take a more active role   and signaled the project s belief in open and public access to source code       openbsd developers do not permit the inclusion of closed source binary drivers in the source tree and are reluctant to sign non disclosure agreements  when no documentation was forthcoming before the deadline for the release of openbsd      support for adaptec aac raid controllers was removed from the standard openbsd kernel because of issues concerning open documentation       since openbsd is based in canada  no united states export restrictions on cryptography apply  allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption  so openbsd comes with a built in cryptographic framework  which is employed in every part of the system  for example  the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key  ensuring that sensitive data don t leak into an insecure part of the system       openbsd randomizes various behaviors of applications  making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack  for example  pids are created and associated randomly to processes  the bind   system call uses random port numbers  files are created with random inode numbers  and ip datagrams have random identifiers       the openbsd policy on openness extends to hardware documentation  in the slides for a december      presentation  de raadt explained that without it  developers often make mistakes writing drivers   and pointed out that  the oh my god  i got it to work rush is harder to achieve  and some developers just give up     he went on to say that vendor binary drivers are unacceptable to openbsd  that they have  no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel  and that there is  no way to fix them     when they break        a goal of the openbsd project is to  maintain the spirit of the original berkeley unix copyrights   which permitted a  relatively un encumbered unix source distribution     to this end  the internet systems consortium  isc  license  a simplified version of the bsd license with wording removed that is unnecessary under the berne convention  is preferred for new code  but the mit or bsd licenses are accepted  the widely used gnu general public license is considered overly restrictive in comparison with these       in june       triggered by concerns over darren reed s modification of ipfilter s license wording  a systematic license audit of the openbsd ports and source trees was undertaken    code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed  ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license  to ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to  an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders  some pieces of code were removed  many were replaced  and others  including the multicast routing tools  mrinfo   and map mbone    which were licensed by xerox for research only  were relicensed so that openbsd could continue to use them  also removed during this audit was all software produced by daniel j  bernstein  at the time  bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution  a requirement to which openbsd developers were unwilling to devote time or effort    the removal led to a clash with bernstein who felt the removal of his software to be uncalled for  he cited the netscape web browser as much less freely licensed and accused the openbsd developers of hypocrisy for permitting netscape to remain while removing his software    the openbsd project s stance was that netscape  although not open source  had license conditions that could be more easily met    they asserted that bernstein s demand for control of derivatives would lead to a great deal of additional work and that removal was the most appropriate way to comply with his requirements       the openbsd team has developed software from scratch  or adopted suitable existing software  because of license concerns  of particular note is the development  after license restrictions were imposed on ipfilter  of the pf packet filter  which first appeared   in openbsd     and is now available in dragonfly bsd  netbsd and freebsd  openbsd developers have also replaced gpl licensed tools  such as diff  grep and pkg config  with bsd licensed equivalents and founded new projects including the openbgpd routing daemon and openntpd time service daemon       although the operating system and its portable components are widely used in commercial products  de raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry   traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our cds  our other products don t really make us much money   obviously  that has not been a lot of money        for a two year period in the early     s  the project received darpa funding  which  paid the salaries of   people to work completely full time  bought about    k in hardware  and paid for   hackathons        de raadt has expressed some concern about the asymmetry of funding   i think that contributions should have come first from the vendors  secondly from the corporate users  and thirdly from individual users  but the response has been almost entirely the opposite  with almost a    to   dollar ratio in favor of the little people  thanks a lot  little people        on    january       bob beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs  if sustainable funding was not found  beck suggested openbsd would shut down    the project soon received a usd        donation from mircea popescu  the romanian creator of the mpex bitcoin stock exchange  paid in bitcoins  the project raised usd           in response to the appeal  enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short term future       the openbsd project had previously experienced another financial danger back in       the mozilla foundation and godaddy com are among the organizations that helped the openbsd project to overcome its financial troubles           shortly after openbsd s creation  theo de raadt was contacted by a local security software company named secure networks  inc  or sni      they were developing a  network security auditing tool  called ballista  later renamed to cybercop scanner after sni was purchased by network associates   which was intended to find and attempt to exploit possible software security flaws  this coincided well with de raadt s own interest in security  so for a time the two cooperated  a relationship that was of particular usefulness leading up to the release of openbsd       and helped to define security as the focal point of the project       openbsd includes features designed to improve security  these include api additions  such as the strlcat and strlcpy   functions  toolchain alterations  including a static bounds checker  memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses  such as propolice and the w^x  w xor x  page protection feature  and cryptography and randomization features       to reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing privilege escalation  some programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege separation  privilege revocation and chrooting  privilege separation is a technique  pioneered on openbsd and inspired by the principle of least privilege  where a program is split into two or more parts  one of which performs privileged operations and the other almost always the bulk of the code runs without privilege    privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them  chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the file system  prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files  developers have applied these features to openbsd versions of common applications  including tcpdump and the apache web server       openbsd developers were instrumental in the birth of and the project continues to develop openssh  a secure replacement for telnet  openssh is based on the original ssh suite and developed further by the openbsd team    it first appeared in openbsd     and is now the most popular ssh implementation  available on many operating systems       the project has a policy of continually auditing code for problems  work that developer marc espie has described as  never finished     more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted   he went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found  including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues   trying to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended   and investigating whether  it s possible to augment the compiler to warn against this specific problem        on    december       gregory perry sent an email to theo de raadt alleging that the fbi had paid some openbsd ex developers    years previously to insert backdoors into the openbsd cryptographic framework  theo de raadt made the email public on    december by forwarding it to the openbsd tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the ipsec codebase      de raadt s response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code  in the weeks that followed  bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors was found    theo de raadt states that  i believe that netsec was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged  if those were written  i don t believe they made it into our tree  they might have been deployed as their own product        the openbsd website features a prominent reference to the security record of the default install  until june       the wording read  five years without a remote hole in the default install   an openssh bug was then discovered that made it possible for a remote attacker to gain root in openbsd and in any of the many other systems running openssh at the time  it was quickly fixed  as is normal with known security holes      the slogan was modified to  one remote hole in the default install  in nearly   years   in      a network related remote vulnerability was found  which was also quickly fixed    the quote was subsequently altered to  only two remote holes in the default install  in a heck of a long time   this wording remains to this day     the default install is quite minimal  but the project states that the default install is intentionally minimal to ensure novice users  do not need to become security experts overnight     which fits with open source and code auditing practices argued to be important elements of a security system       the name openbsd refers to the fact that openbsd s source code is freely available through the internet  it also refers to the wide range of hardware platforms the operating system supports       openbsd is available freely in various ways  the source can be retrieved by anonymous cvs    and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded either by ftp  http  rsync or afs    prepackaged cd rom sets can be ordered online for a small fee  complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release s theme song  these  with their artwork and other bonuses  are one of the project s few sources of income  funding hardware  bandwidth and other expenses       in common with other operating systems  openbsd provides a package management system for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system    packages are binary files which are extracted  managed and removed using the package tools  on openbsd  the source of packages is the ports system  a collection of makefiles and other infrastructure required to create packages  in openbsd  the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version  this means that the ports or packages released with  for example      are not suitable for use with     and vice versa       openbsd at first used the bsd daemon mascot created by phil foglio  updated by john lasseter and copyright marshall kirk mckusick  a specialized version of the daemon  the haloed daemon was drawn by erick green  green was asked by theo de raadt to create the logo for the     and     versions of openbsd  at first  it was planned to create a full daemon  including head and body  but green was only able to complete the head part for openbsd      the body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for openbsd        subsequent releases saw variations  such as cop daemon by ty semaka    but eventually settling on puffy    described as a pufferfish    since then puffy has appeared on openbsd promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork  the promotional material of early openbsd releases did not have a cohesive theme or design but later the cd roms  release songs  posters and tee shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme  sometimes contributed to by ty semaka of the plaid tongued devils    these have become a part of openbsd advocacy  with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project  often through parody    past themes have included  in openbsd      the hackers of the lost raid  a parody of indiana jones linked to the new raid tools featured as part of the release  the wizard of os  making its debut in openbsd      based on the work of pink floyd and a parody of the wizard of oz related to the project s recent wireless work  and openbsd     s puff the barbarian  including an   s rock style song and parody of conan the barbarian  alluding to open documentation           videos    bigger mailing lists
