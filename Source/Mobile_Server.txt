 a mobile server is a computer system  computer hardware and operating system   that responds to requests across a computer network to provide  or help to provide  a network service  while being easily portable in a laptop form factor      in contrast to large data centers or rack servers  the mobile server is designed for on the road development and adhoc deployment  it allows for quick deployment and can be easily transported  hand carried  into emergency  disaster  or temporary environments where traditional servers are not feasible due to their power requirements  size  etc   the main beneficiaries of so called  server on the go  technology include network managers  software or database developers  training centers  military personnel  law enforcement  forensics  emergency relief and service organizations      to facilitate portability  features such as the keyboard  display  battery  uninterruptible power supply  to provide power redundancy in case of failure   and mouse are all integrated into the chassis     a mobile server is not meant to replace conventional server systems  in environments where space  weight  mobility and energy bottlenecks don t exist  rackmount and tower servers remain the most cost effective and highest density options  a mobile server addresses emerging needs and opens up new opportunities for users who require server grade hardware in a mobile form factor     a mobile server is really for traveling engineering it professionals  software developers  training instructors  military personnel  emergency relief personnel  service organization field staff  and so on      a mobile server is powerful enough so that you can rush to a client s site  to your field office  or to some site where you have to run a technical training class and deploy it as short term lan based solution  it is about having engineering class workstation and engineering class it server power with you as you run down the road to solve your next mission critical assignment      there are several ways of supplementing a laptop for engineers who travel  but need more horsepower for their work  it involves not only engineering laptops as client workstations  but  thin clients   which are computers that depend heavily on other computers  and their server  to fulfill their computational roles  to bring this hardware together  engineers are utilizing a full fledged computer network and at least one server with enough scalability  capacity and performance to take on many different types of design requirements and projects  including analysis and simulation  the idea is to take your entire computing environment with you  including servers  workstations  thin clients and network infrastructure
