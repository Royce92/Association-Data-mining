 in information technology  a backup  or the process of backing up  refers to the copying and archiving of computer data so it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event  the verb form is to back up in two words  whereas the noun is backup      backups have two distinct purposes  the primary purpose is to recover data after its loss  be it by data deletion or corruption  data loss can be a common experience of computer users  a      survey found that     of respondents had lost files on their home pc   the secondary purpose of backups is to recover data from an earlier time  according to a user defined data retention policy  typically configured within a backup application for how long copies of data are required  though backups popularly represent a simple form of disaster recovery  and should be part of a disaster recovery plan  by themselves  backups should not alone be considered disaster recovery   one reason for this is that not all backup systems or backup applications are able to reconstitute a computer system or other complex configurations such as a computer cluster  active directory servers  or a database server  by restoring only data from a backup     since a backup system contains at least one copy of all data worth saving  the data storage requirements can be significant  organizing this storage space and managing the backup process can be a complicated undertaking  a data repository model can be used to provide structure to the storage  nowadays  there are many different types of data storage devices that are useful for making backups  there are also many different ways in which these devices can be arranged to provide geographic redundancy  data security  and portability     before data are sent to their storage locations  they are selected  extracted  and manipulated  many different techniques have been developed to optimize the backup procedure  these include optimizations for dealing with open files and live data sources as well as compression  encryption  and de duplication  among others  every backup scheme should include dry runs that validate the reliability of the data being backed up  it is important to recognize the limitations and human factors involved in any backup scheme             any backup strategy starts with a concept of a data repository  the backup data needs to be stored  and probably should be organized to a degree  the organisation could be as simple as a sheet of paper with a list of all backup media  cds etc   and the dates they were produced  a more sophisticated setup could include a computerized index  catalog  or relational database  different approaches have different advantages  part of the model is the backup rotation scheme     regardless of the repository model that is used  the data has to be stored on some data storage medium     regardless of the data repository model  or data storage media used for backups  a balance needs to be struck between accessibility  security and cost  these media management methods are not mutually exclusive and are frequently combined to meet the user s needs  using on line disks for staging data before it is sent to a near line tape library is a common example     a successful backup job starts with selecting and extracting coherent units of data  most data on modern computer systems is stored in discrete units  known as files  these files are organized into filesystems  files that are actively being updated can be thought of as  live  and present a challenge to back up  it is also useful to save metadata that describes the computer or the filesystem being backed up     deciding what to back up at any given time is a harder process than it seems  by backing up too much redundant data  the data repository will fill up too quickly  backing up an insufficient amount of data can eventually lead to the loss of critical information     if a computer system is in use while it is being backed up  the possibility of files being open for reading or writing is real  if a file is open  the contents on disk may not correctly represent what the owner of the file intends  this is especially true for database files of all kinds  the term fuzzy backup can be used to describe a backup of live data that looks like it ran correctly  but does not represent the state of the data at any single point in time  this is because the data being backed up changed in the period of time between when the backup started and when it finished  for databases in particular  fuzzy backups are worthless citation needed    not all information stored on the computer is stored in files  accurately recovering a complete system from scratch requires keeping track of this non file data too     it is frequently useful or required to manipulate the data being backed up to optimize the backup process  these manipulations can provide many benefits including improved backup speed  restore speed  data security  media usage and or reduced bandwidth requirements     as long as new data are being created and changes are being made  backups will need to be performed at frequent intervals  individuals and organizations with anything from one computer to thousands of computer systems all require protection of data  the scales may be very different  but the objectives and limitations are essentially the same  those who perform backups need to know how successful the backups are  regardless of scale     an effective backup scheme will take into consideration the limitations of the situation     meeting the defined objectives in the face of the above limitations can be a difficult task  the tools and concepts below can make that task more achievable     to ensure that the backup scheme is working as expected  key factors should be monitored and historical data maintained
