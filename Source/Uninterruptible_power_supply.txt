 an uninterruptible power supply  also uninterruptible power source  ups or battery flywheel backup  is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source  typically mains power  fails  a ups differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near instantaneous protection from input power interruptions  by supplying energy stored in batteries  supercapacitors  or flywheels  the on battery runtime of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short  only a few minutes  but sufficient to start a standby power source or properly shut down the protected equipment     a ups is typically used to protect hardware such as computers  data centers  telecommunication equipment or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries  fatalities  serious business disruption or data loss  ups units range in size from units designed to protect a single computer without a video monitor  around     volt ampere rating  to large units powering entire data centers or buildings  the world s largest ups  the    megawatt battery electric storage system  bess   in fairbanks  alaska  powers the entire city and nearby rural communities during outages              the primary role of any ups is to provide short term power when the input power source fails  however  most ups units are also capable in varying degrees of correcting common utility power problems     ups units are divided into categories based on which of the above problems they address dubious   discuss and some manufacturers categorize their products in accordance with the number of power related problems they address      the three general categories of modern ups systems are on line  line interactive or standby    an on line ups uses a  double conversion  method of accepting ac input  rectifying to dc for passing through the rechargeable battery  or battery strings   then inverting back to    xa v    xa v ac for powering the protected equipment  a line interactive ups maintains the inverter in line and redirects the battery s dc current path from the normal charging mode to supplying current when power is lost  in a standby   off line   system the load is powered directly by the input power and the backup power circuitry is only invoked when the utility power fails  most ups below  xa kva are of the line interactive or standby variety which are usually less expensive     for large power units    dynamic uninterruptible power supplies  dups  are sometimes used  a synchronous motor alternator is connected on the mains via a choke  energy is stored in a flywheel  when the mains power fails  an eddy current regulation maintains the power on the load as long as the flywheel s energy is not exhausted  dups are sometimes combined or integrated with a diesel generator that is turned on after a brief delay  forming a diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply  drups      a fuel cell ups has been developed in recent years using hydrogen and a fuel cell as a power source  potentially providing long run times in a small space citation needed    the offline standby ups  sps  offers only the most basic features  providing surge protection and battery backup  the protected equipment is normally connected directly to incoming utility power  when the incoming voltage falls below or rises above a predetermined level the sps turns on its internal dc ac inverter circuitry  which is powered from an internal storage battery  the ups then mechanically switches the connected equipment on to its dc ac inverter output  the switchover time can be as long as    milliseconds depending on the amount of time it takes the standby ups to detect the lost utility voltage  the ups will be designed to power certain equipment  such as a personal computer  without any objectionable dip or brownout to that device     the line interactive ups is similar in operation to a standby ups  but with the addition of a multi tap variable voltage autotransformer  this is a special type of transformer that can add or subtract powered coils of wire  thereby increasing or decreasing the magnetic field and the output voltage of the transformer  this is also known as a buck boost transformer     this type of ups is able to tolerate continuous undervoltage brownouts and overvoltage surges without consuming the limited reserve battery power  it instead compensates by automatically selecting different power taps on the autotransformer  depending on the design  changing the autotransformer tap can cause a very brief output power disruption   which may cause upss equipped with a power loss alarm to  chirp  for a moment     this has become popular even in the cheapest upss because it takes advantage of components already included  the main      xa hz transformer used to convert between line voltage and battery voltage needs to provide two slightly different turns ratios  one to convert the battery output voltage  typically a multiple of   xa v  to line voltage  and a second one to convert the line voltage to a slightly higher battery charging voltage  such as a multiple of   xa v   the difference between the two voltages is because charging a battery requires a delta voltage  up to      xa v for charging a   xa v battery   furthermore  it is easier to do the switching on the line voltage side of the transformer because of the lower currents on that side     to gain the buck boost feature  all that is required is two separate switches so that the ac input can be connected to one of the two primary taps  while the load is connected to the other  thus using the main transformer s primary windings as an autotransformer  the battery can still be charged while  bucking  an overvoltage  but while  boosting  an undervoltage  the transformer output is too low to charge the batteries     autotransformers can be engineered to cover a wide range of varying input voltages  but this requires more taps and increases complexity  and expense of the ups  it is common for the autotransformer to cover a range only from about   xa v to    xa v for    xa v power  and then switch to battery if the voltage goes much higher or lower than that range     in low voltage conditions the ups will use more current than normal so it may need a higher current circuit than a normal device  for example to power a      w device at    xa v  the ups will draw     xa a  if a brownout occurs and the voltage drops to    xa v  the ups will draw   xa a to compensate  this also works in reverse  so that in an overvoltage condition  the ups will need less current     in an online ups  the batteries are always connected to the inverter  so that no power transfer switches are necessary  when power loss occurs  the rectifier simply drops out of the circuit and the batteries keep the power steady and unchanged  when power is restored  the rectifier resumes carrying most of the load and begins charging the batteries  though the charging current may be limited to prevent the high power rectifier from overheating the batteries and boiling off the electrolyte  the main advantage of an on line ups is its ability to provide an  electrical firewall  between the incoming utility power and sensitive electronic equipment     the online ups is ideal for environments where electrical isolation is necessary or for equipment that is very sensitive to power fluctuations  although once previously reserved for very large installations of   xa kw or more  advances in technology have now permitted it to be available as a common consumer device  supplying    xa w or less  the initial cost of the online ups may be higher  but its total cost of ownership is generally lower due to longer battery life  the online ups may be necessary when the power environment is  noisy   when utility power sags  outages and other anomalies are frequent  when protection of sensitive it equipment loads is required  or when operation from an extended run backup generator is necessary     the basic technology of the online ups is the same as in a standby or line interactive ups  however it typically costs much more  due to it having a much greater current ac to dc battery charger rectifier  and with the rectifier and inverter designed to run continuously with improved cooling systems  it is called a double conversion ups due to the rectifier directly driving the inverter  even when powered from normal ac current     these hybrid rotary ups  designs do not have official designations  although one name used by hp and eaton is  double conversion on demand    this style of ups is targeted towards high efficiency applications while still maintaining the features and protection level offered by double conversion     a hybrid  double conversion on demand  ups operates as an off line standby ups when power conditions are within a certain preset window  this allows the ups to achieve very high efficiency ratings  when the power conditions fluctuate outside of the predefined windows  the ups switches to online double conversion operation   in double conversion mode the ups can adjust for voltage variations without having to use battery power  can filter out line noise and control frequency  examples of this hybrid double conversion on demand ups design are the hp r      hp r       hp rp        and the eaton bladeups     ferro resonant units operate in the same way as a standby ups unit  however  they are online with the exception that a ferro resonant transformer is used to filter the output  this transformer is designed to hold energy long enough to cover the time between switching from line power to battery power and effectively eliminates the transfer time  many ferro resonant upss are        efficient  ac dc ac  and offer excellent isolation     the transformer has three windings  one for ordinary mains power  the second for rectified battery power  and the third for output ac power to the load     this once was the dominant type of ups and is limited to around the     kva range  these units are still mainly used in some industrial settings  oil and gas  petrochemical  chemical  utility  and heavy industry markets  due to the robust nature of the ups  many ferro resonant upss utilizing controlled ferro technology may not interact with power factor correcting equipment further explanation needed    a ups designed for powering dc equipment is very similar to an online ups  except that it does not need an output inverter  also  if the ups s battery voltage is matched with the voltage the device needs  the device s power supply will not be needed either  since one or more power conversion steps are eliminated  this increases efficiency and run time     many systems used in telecommunications use an extra low voltage  common battery    xa v dc power  because it has less restrictive safety regulations  such as being installed in conduit and junction boxes  dc has typically been the dominant power source for telecommunications  and ac has typically been the dominant source for computers and servers     there has been much experimentation with   xa v dc power for computer servers  in the hope of reducing the likelihood of failure and the cost of equipment  however  to supply the same amount of power  the current would be higher than an equivalent    xa v or    xa v circuit  greater current requires larger conductors  or more energy lost as heat     a laptop computer is a classic example of a pc with a dc ups built in     high voltage dc     xa v  is finding use in some data center applications  and allows for small power conductors  but is subject to the more complex electrical code rules for safe containment of high voltages      a rotary ups uses the inertia of a high mass spinning flywheel  flywheel energy storage  to provide short term ride through in the event of power loss  the flywheel also acts as a buffer against power spikes and sags  since such short term power events are not able to appreciably affect the rotational speed of the high mass flywheel  it is also one of the oldest designs  predating vacuum tubes and integrated circuits     it can be considered to be on line since it spins continuously under normal conditions  however  unlike a battery based ups  flywheel based ups systems typically provide    to    seconds of protection before the flywheel has slowed and power output stops   it is traditionally used in conjunction with standby diesel generators  providing backup power only for the brief period of time the engine needs to start running and stabilize its output     the rotary ups is generally reserved for applications needing more than       xa w of protection  to justify the expense and benefit from the advantages rotary ups systems bring  a larger flywheel or multiple flywheels operating in parallel will increase the reserve running time or capacity     because the flywheels are a mechanical power source  it is not necessary to use an electric motor or generator as an intermediary between it and a diesel engine designed to provide emergency power  by using a transmission gearbox  the rotational inertia of the flywheel can be used to directly start up a diesel engine  and once running  the diesel engine can be used to directly spin the flywheel  multiple flywheels can likewise be connected in parallel through mechanical countershafts  without the need for separate motors and generators for each flywheel     they are normally designed to provide very high current output compared to a purely electronic ups  and are better able to provide inrush current for inductive loads such as motor startup or compressor loads  as well as medical mri and cath lab equipment  it is also able to tolerate short circuit conditions up to    times larger than an electronic ups  permitting one device to blow a fuse and fail while other devices still continue to be powered from the rotary ups     its life cycle is usually far greater than a purely electronic ups  up to    years or more  but they do require periodic downtime for mechanical maintenance  such as ball bearing replacement  in larger systems redundancy of the system ensures the availability of processes during this maintenance  battery based designs do not require downtime if the batteries can be hot swapped  which is usually the case for larger units  newer rotary units use technologies such as magnetic bearings and air evacuated enclosures to increase standby efficiency and reduce maintenance to very low levels     typically  the high mass flywheel is used in conjunction with a motor generator system  these units can be configured as     in case no xa   the motor generator can be synchronous synchronous or induction synchronous  the motor side of the unit in case nos xa   and   can be driven directly by an ac power source  typically when in inverter bypass   a   step double conversion motor drive  or a   pulse inverter  case no xa   uses an integrated flywheel as a short term energy source instead of batteries to allow time for external  electrically coupled gensets to start and be brought online  case nos xa   and   can use batteries or a free standing electrically coupled flywheel as the short term energy source     ups systems come in several different forms and sizes  however  the two most common forms are tower and rack mount       tower models stand upright on the ground or on a desk shelf  and are typically used in network workstations or desktop computer applications     rack mount models can be mounted in standard     rack enclosures and can require anywhere from  u to   u  rack space   they are typically used in server and networking applications     in large business environments where reliability is of great importance  a single huge ups can also be a single point of failure that can disrupt many other systems  to provide greater reliability  multiple smaller ups modules and batteries can be integrated together to provide redundant power protection equivalent to one very large ups   n    means that if the load can be supplied by n modules  the installation will contain n   modules  in this way  failure of one module will not impact system operation       many computer servers offer the option of redundant power supplies  so that in the event of one power supply failing  one or more other power supplies are able to power the load  this is a critical point   each power supply must be able to power the entire server by itself     redundancy is further enhanced by plugging each power supply into a different circuit  i e  to a different circuit breaker      redundant protection can be extended further yet by connecting each power supply to its own ups  this provides double protection from both a power supply failure and a ups failure  so that continued operation is assured  this configuration is also referred to as     or  n redundancy  if the budget does not allow for two identical ups units then it is common practice to plug one power supply into mains power and the other into the ups       when a ups system is placed outdoors  it should have some specific features that guarantee that it can tolerate weather with no effect on performance  factors such as temperature  humidity  rain  and snow among others should be considered by the manufacturer when designing an outdoor ups system  operating temperature ranges for outdoor ups systems could be around    xa  c to    xa  c       outdoor ups systems can be pole  ground  pedestal   or host mounted  outdoor environment could mean extreme cold  in which case the outdoor ups system should include a battery heater mat  or extreme heat  in which case the outdoor ups system should include a fan system or an air conditioning system     ups systems can be designed to be placed inside a computer chassis  there are two types of internal ups  the first type is a miniaturized regular ups that is made small enough to fit into a      inch cd rom slot bay of a regular computer chassis  the other type is a re engineered switching power supply that utilizes dual ac or dc power sources as inputs and has built in switching control units     the way efficiency is measured varies  and there are a number of reasons for this  many ups manufacturers claim to have the highest level of efficiency  often using different sets of criteria in order to reach these figures  the industry norm can be argued to be anything between         when a ups is in full operational mode  and to reach these figures companies often put their ups in an ideal scenario  efficiency figures on site are often much closer to the     mark  due to varying power conditions citation needed    a problem in the combination of a  double conversion  ups and a generator is the voltage distortion created by the ups  the input of a double conversion ups is essentially a big rectifier  the current drawn by the ups is non sinusoidal  this can cause the voltage from the ac mains or a generator to also become non sinusoidal  the voltage distortion then can cause problems in all electrical equipment connected to that power source  including the ups itself  it will also cause more power to be lost in the wiring supplying power to the ups due to the spikes in current flow  this level of  noise  is measured as a percentage of  total harmonic distortion of the current   thd i    classic ups rectifiers have a thd i  level of around         to reduce voltage distortion  this requires heavier mains wiring or generators more than twice as large as the ups     there are several solutions to reduce the thd i  in a double conversion ups     passive power factor correction     classic solutions such as passive filters reduce thd i  to       at full load  they are reliable  but big and only work at full load  and present their own problems when used in tandem with generators     active power factor correction     an alternative solution is an active filter  through the use of such a device  thd i  can drop to    over the full power range  the newest technology in double conversion ups units is a rectifier that doesn t use classic rectifier components  thyristors and diodes  but high frequency components  a double conversion ups with an igbt rectifier and inductor can have a thd i  as small as     this completely eliminates the need to oversize the generator  and transformers   without additional filters  investment cost  losses  or space     power management  pm  requires    the basic computer to ups control methods are intended for one to one signaling from a single source to a single target  for example  a single ups may connect to a single computer to provide status information about the ups  and allow the computer to control the ups  similarly  the usb protocol is also intended to connect a single computer to multiple peripheral devices     in some situations it is useful for a single large ups to be able to communicate with several protected devices  for traditional serial or usb control  a signal replication device may be used  which for example allows one ups to connect to five computers using serial or usb connections    however  the splitting is typically only one direction from ups to the devices to provide status information  return control signals may only be permitted from one of the protected systems to the ups       as ethernet has increased in common use since the     s  control signals are now commonly sent between a single ups and multiple computers using standard ethernet data communication methods such as tcp ip    the status and control information is typically encrypted so that for example an outside hacker can not gain control of the ups and command it to shut down       distribution of ups status and control data requires that all intermediary devices such as ethernet switches or serial multiplexers be powered by one or more ups systems  in order for the ups alerts to reach the target systems during a power outage  to avoid the dependency on ethernet infrastructure  the upss can be connected directly to main control server by using gsm gprs channel also  the sms or gprs data packets sent from upss trigger software to shutdown the pcs to reduce the load     the run time for a battery operated ups depends on the type and size of batteries and rate of discharge  and the efficiency of the inverter  the total capacity of a lead acid battery is a function of the rate at which it is discharged  which is described as peukert s law     manufacturers supply run time rating in minutes for packaged ups systems  larger systems  such as for data centers  require detailed calculation of the load  inverter efficiency  and battery characteristics to ensure the required endurance is attained       when a lead acid battery is charged or discharged  this initially affects only the reacting chemicals  which are at the interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte  with time  the charge stored in the chemicals at the interface  often called  interface charge   spreads by diffusion of these chemicals throughout the volume of the active material     if a battery has been completely discharged  e g  the car lights were left on overnight  and next is given a fast charge for only a few minutes  then during the short charging time it develops only a charge near the interface  the battery voltage may rise to be close to the charger voltage so that the charging current decreases significantly  after a few hours this interface charge will spread to the volume of the electrode and electrolyte  leading to an interface charge so low that it may be insufficient to start the car       due to the interface charge  brief ups self test functions lasting only a few seconds may not accurately reflect the true runtime capacity of a ups  and instead an extended recalibration or rundown test that deeply discharges the battery is needed       the deep discharge testing is itself damaging to batteries due to the chemicals in the discharged battery starting to crystallize into highly stable molecular shapes that will not re dissolve when the battery is recharged  permanently reducing charge capacity  in lead acid batteries this is known as sulfation but also affects other types such as nickel cadmium batteries and lithium batteries    therefore it is commonly recommended that rundown tests be performed infrequently  such as every six months to a year         multi kilowatt commercial ups systems with large and easily accessible battery banks are capable of isolating and testing individual cells within a battery string  which consists of either combined cell battery units  such as    v lead acid batteries  or individual chemical cells wired in series  isolating a single cell and installing a jumper in place of it allows the one battery to be discharge tested  while the rest of the battery string remains charged and available to provide protection       it is also possible to measure the electrical characteristics of individual cells in a battery string  using intermediate sensor wires that are installed at every cell to cell junction  and monitored both individually and collectively  battery strings may also be wired as series parallel  for example two sets of    cells  in such a situation it is also necessary to monitor current flow between parallel strings  as current may circulate between the strings to balance out the effects of weak cells  dead cells with high resistance  or shorted cells  for example  stronger strings can discharge through weaker strings until voltage imbalances are equalized  and this must be factored into the individual inter cell measurements within each string       battery strings wired in series parallel can develop unusual failure modes due to interactions between the multiple parallel strings  defective batteries in one string can adversely affect the operation and lifespan of good or new batteries in other strings  these issues also apply to other situations where series parallel strings are used  not just in ups systems but also in electric vehicle applications       consider a series parallel battery arrangement with all good cells  and one becomes shorted or dead     the only way to prevent these subtle series parallel string interactions is by not using parallel strings at all and using separate charge controllers and inverters for individual series strings     even just a single string of batteries wired in series can have adverse interactions if new batteries are mixed with old batteries  older batteries tend to have reduced storage capacity  and so will both discharge faster than new batteries and also charge to their maximum capacity more rapidly than new batteries     as a mixed string of new and old batteries is depleted  the string voltage will drop  and when the old batteries are exhausted the new batteries still have charge available  the newer cells may continue to discharge through the rest of the string  but due to the low voltage this energy flow may not be useful  and may be wasted in the old cells as resistance heating     for cells that are supposed to operate within a specific discharge window  new cells with more capacity may cause the old cells in the series string to continue to discharge beyond the safe bottom limit of the discharge window  damaging the old cells     when recharged  the old cells recharge more rapidly  leading to a rapid rise of voltage to near the fully charged state  but before the new cells with more capacity have fully recharged  the charge controller detects the high voltage of a nearly fully charged string and reduces current flow  the new cells with more capacity now charge very slowly  so slowly that the chemicals may begin to crystallize before reaching the fully charged state  reducing new cell capacity over several charge discharge cycles until their capacity more closely matches the old cells in the series string     for such reasons  some industrial ups management systems recommend periodic replacement of entire battery arrays potentially using hundreds of expensive batteries  due to these damaging interactions between new batteries and old batteries  within and across series and parallel strings
