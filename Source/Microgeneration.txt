 microgeneration is the small scale generation of heat and electric power by individuals  small businesses and communities to meet their own needs  as alternatives or supplements to traditional centralized grid connected power  although this may be motivated by practical considerations  such as unreliable grid power or long distance from the electrical grid  the term is mainly used currently for environmentally conscious approaches that aspire to zero or low carbon footprints or cost reduction  it differs from micropower in that it is principally concerned with fixed power plants rather than for use with mobile devices             microgeneration technologies include small scale wind turbines  micro hydro  photovoltaic solar systems  plant microbial fuel cells  ground source heat pumps  and micro combined heat and power  microchp  installations      in addition to the electricity production plant  e g  wind turbine  solar panel        infrastructure for energy storage and power conversion and a hook up to the regular electricity grid is usually needed and or foreseen  although a hookup to the regular electricity grid is not essential  it helps to decrease costs by allowing financial recompensation schemes  in the developing world however  the start up cost for this equipment is generally too high  thus leaving no choice but to opt for alternative set ups      the whole of the equipment required to set up a working system and for an off the grid generation and or a hook up to the electricity grid herefore is termed a balance of system  and is composed of the following parts with pv systems     a major issue with off grid solar and wind systems is that the power is often needed when the sun is not shining or when the wind is calm  this is generally not required for purely grid connected systems     or other means of energy storage  e g  hydrogen fuel cells  flywheel energy storage  pumped storage hydroelectricity  compressed air tanks           for converting dc battery power into ac as required for many appliances  or for feeding excess power into a commercial power grid     usually  in microgeneration for homes in the developing world  a prefabricated house wiring systems  as wiring harnesses or prefabricated distribution units  is used instead    simplified house wiring boxes  known as wiring harnesses can be simply bought and drilled in the wall without requiring much knowledge on the wiring itself  as such  even people without technical expertise are able to install them  in addition  they are also comparatively cheap and offer safety advantages      with wind turbines  hydroelectric plants      the extra equipment needed        is more or less the same as with pv systems  depending on the type of wind turbine used    yet also include     a new wind energy technology is being developed that converts energy from wind energy vibrations to electricity  this energy  called vibro wind technology  can use winds of less strength than normal wind turbines  and can be placed in almost any location  the vibro wind setup is also more economically viable     a prototype consisted of a panel mounted with oscillators made out of pieces of foam  the conversion from mechanical to electrical energy is done using a piezoelectric transducer  a device made of a ceramic or polymer that emits electrons when stressed  the building of this prototype was led by francis moon  professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at cornell university  moon s work in vibro wind technology was funded by the atkinson center for a sustainable future at cornell       several microgeneration set ups are possible  these are     all set ups mentioned can work either on a single power plant or a combination of power plants  in which case it is called a hybrid power system      note  for safety reasons  there are legal requirementsclarification needed  in what jurisdiction   that all domestic grid connected set ups must automatically switch off when there is a failure of the mains power supply  this means that they can not supply electricity during power cuts  the appropriate supply regulations should be consulted when planning a system  for more about this  see the article on the condition of islanding     depending on the set up chosen  financial recompensation scheme  power plant  extra equipment   prices may vary  according to practical action  microgeneration at home which uses the latest in cost saving technology  wiring harnesses  ready boards  cheap diy power plants  e g  diy wind turbines        the household expenditure can be extremely low cost  in fact  practical action mentions that many households in farming communities in the developing world spend less than    for electricity per month      however  if matters are handled less economically  using more commercial systems approaches   costs will be dramatically higher  in most cases however  financial advantage will still be done using microgeneration on renewable power plants  often in the range of           as local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the joule effect in transformers where in general       of the energy is lost       in the uk  the government offers both grants and feedback payments to help businesses  communities and private homes to install these technologies  businesses can write the full cost of installation off against taxable profits whilst homeowners receive a flat rate grant or payments per kw h of electricity generated and paid back into the national grid  community organisations can also receive up to          in grant funding       in the uk  the microgeneration certification scheme provides approval for microgeneration installers and products which is a mandatory requirement of funding schemes such as the feed in tariffs and renewable heat incentive     grid parity or  socket parity   occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost  lcoe  that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid  reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support  it is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of energy will take place when they reach grid parity     grid parity has been reached in some locations with on shore wind power around       and with solar power it was achieved for the first time in spain in                can be used for heating purposes  thus greatly increasing efficiency and offsetting energy total costs  this method is known as micro combined heat and power  microchp      it is used in some privately owned industrial combined heat and power  chp  installations  it s also use in large scale applications where it s called district heating and uses the heat that is normally exhausted by inefficient powerplants       microgeneration can dynamically balance the supply and demand for electric power  by producing more power during periods of high demand and high grid prices  and less power during periods of low demand and low grid prices  this  hybridized grid  allows both microgeneration systems and large power plants to operate with greater energy efficiency and cost effectiveness than either could alone     microgeneration can be integrated as part of a self sufficient house and is typically complemented with other technologies such as domestic food production systems  permaculture and agroecosystem   hydrogen or other extra electricity generation systems for self sufficient transport  rainwater harvesting  composting toilets or even complete greywater treatment systems  domestic microgeneration technologies include  photovoltaic solar systems  small scale wind turbines  ground source heat pumps  micro combined heat and power installations  biodiesel and biogas     private generation decentralizes the generation of electricity and may also centralize the pooling of surplus energy  while they have to be purchased  solar shingles and panels are both available  capital cost is high  but saves in the long run  with appropriate power conversion  solar pv panels can run the same electric appliances as electricity from other sources       passive solar water heating is another effective method of utilizing solar power  the simplest method is the solar  or a black plastic  bag  set between   and   gallons out in the sun and allow to heat  perfect for a quick warm shower       the  breadbox  heater can be constructed easily with recycled materials and basic building experience  consisting of a single or array of black tanks mounted inside a sturdy box insulated on the bottom and sides  the lid  either horizontal or angled to catch the most sun  should be well sealed and of a transparent glazing material  glass  fiberglass  or high temp resistant molded plastic   cold water enters the tank near the bottom  heats and rises to the top where it is piped back into the home       ground source heat pumps exploit stable ground temperatures by benefiting from the thermal energy storage capacity of the ground  typically ground source heat pumps have a high initial cost and are difficult to install by the average homeowner  they use electric motors to transfer heat from the ground with a high level of efficiency  the electricity may come from renewable sources or from external non renewable sources     biodiesel is an alternative fuel that can power diesel engines and can be used for domestic heating  numerous forms of biomass  including soybeans  peanuts  and algae  which has the highest yield   can be used to make biodiesel  recycled vegetable oil  from restaurants  can also be converted into biodiesel     biogas is another alternative fuel  created from the waste product of animals  though less practical for most homes  a farm environment provides a perfect place to implement the process  by mixing the waste and water in a tank with space left for air  methane produces naturally in the airspace  this methane can be piped out and burned  and used for a cookfire     the biogaspro digester provides an easily installed digester suitable for small farms or even large homes  groups of homes can possible group together to use a digester       policymakers were accustomed to an energy system based on big  centralised projects like nuclear or gas fired power stations  a change of mindsets and incentives are bringing microgeneration into the mainstream  planning regulations may also require streamlining to facilitate the retrofitting of microgenerating facilities onto homes and buildings     most of developed countries  including canada  alberta   the united kingdom  germany  poland  israel   and usa have laws allowing microgenerated electricity to be sold into the national grid     in january       the government of alberta s micro generation regulation came into effect  setting rules that allow albertans to generate their own environmentally friendly electricity and receive credit for any power they send into the electricity grid     in december       the polish government will vote on a bill which calls for microgeneration  as well as large scale wind farms in the baltic sea as a solution to cut back on co  emissions from the country s coal plants as well as to reduce polish dependence on russian gas  under the terms of the new bill  individuals and small businesses which generate up to    kw of  green  energy will receive      of market price for any electricity they feed back into the grid  and businesses who set up large scale offshore wind farms in the baltic will be eligible for subsidization by the state  costs of implementing these new policies will be offset by the creation of a new tax on non sustainable energy use        the united states has inconsistent energy generation policies across its    states  state energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location  some states have imposed requirements on utilities that a certain percentage of total power generation be from renewable sources  for this purpose  renewable sources include wind  hydroelectric  and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects  further  in some areas transferrable  renewable source energy  credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates  as a result  in some portions of the united states  power companies will pay a portion of the cost of renewable source microgeneration projects in their service areas  these rebates are in addition to any federal or state renewable energy income tax credits that may be applicable  in other areas  such rebates may differ or may not be available     the uk government published its microgeneration strategy   in march       although it was seen as a disappointment by many commentators    in contrast  the climate change and sustainable energy act      has been viewed as a positive step    to replace earlier schemes  the department of trade and industry  dti  launched the low carbon buildings programme in april       which provided grants to individuals  communities and businesses wishing to invest in microgenerating technologies  these schemes have been replaced in turn by new proposals from the department for energy and climate change  decc  for clean energy cashback via feed in tariffs    for generating electricity from april      and the renewable heat incentive    for generating renewable heat from    november          feed in tariffs are intended to incentivise small scale  less than  mw   low carbon electricity generation  these feed in tariffs work alongside the renewables obligation  ro   which will remain the primary mechanism to incentivise deployment of large scale renewable electricity generation  the renewable heat incentive  rhi  in intended to incentivise the generation of heat from renewable sources  they also currently offer up to   p per kwh from december      in the tariff for photovoltaics plus another  p for the export tariff   an overall figure which could see a household earning back double what they currently pay for their electricity       on    october       the government announced a sudden cut in the feed in tariff from     p kwh to   p kwh with the new tariff to apply to all new solar pv installations with an eligibility date on or after    december            prominent british politicians who have announced they are fitting microgenerating facilities to their homes include the conservative party leader  david cameron  and the labour science minister  malcolm wicks  these plans included small domestic sized wind turbines  cameron  before becoming prime minister in the      general elections  had been asked during an interview on bbc one s the politics show on october           if he would do the same should he get to    downing street   if they d let me  yes   he replied       in the december      pre budget report   the government announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal use  would not be subject to income tax  legislation to this effect has been included in the finance bill            microgeneration has been popularised by several movies  tv shows  and magazines  movies such as the mosquito coast  jericho  the time machine  and beverly hills family robinson have done a great deal in raising interest to the general public  more specialised magazines such as otherpower and home power give more practical advice and guidance    websites such as instructables and practical action are increasing the popularity of microgeneration by proposing diy solutions which can decrease the cost of microgeneration
