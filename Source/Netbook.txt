 netbooks is a category of small  lightweight  legacy free  and inexpensive computers that were introduced in       netbooks compete in the same market segment as tablet computers and chromebooks  a variation on the portable network computer      at their inception in late       as smaller notebooks optimized for low weight and low cost    netbooks omitted certain features  e g   the optical drive   featured smaller screens and keyboards  and offered reduced computing power when compared to a full sized laptop  over the course of their evolution  netbooks have ranged in size from below    screen diagonal to      a typical weight is   kg      pounds   often significantly less expensive than other laptops   by mid       some wireless data carriers began to offer netbooks to users  free of charge   with an extended service contract purchase      in the short period since their appearance  netbooks grew in size and features  and converged with smaller  lighter laptops and subnotebooks  by august       when comparing a dell netbook to a dell notebook  cnet called netbooks  nothing more than smaller  cheaper notebooks   noting   the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other   and  the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices    in an attempt to prevent cannibalizing the more lucrative laptops in their lineup  manufacturers imposed several constraints on netbooks  however this would soon push netbooks into a niche where they had few distinctive advantages over traditional laptops or tablet computers  see below       by       the increasing popularity of tablet computers  particularly the ipad  a different form factor  but with improved computing capabilities and lower production cost had led to a decline in netbook sales   at the high end of the performance spectrum  ultrabooks  ultra light portables with a traditional keyboard and display have been revolutionized by the       macbook air  which made fewer performance sacrifices albeit at considerably higher production cost    capitalizing on the success of the macbook air    and in response to it  intel promoted ultrabook as a new high mobility standard  which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed        as a result of these two developments  netbooks of      have kept price as their only strong point  losing in the design  ease of use and portability department to tablets  and tablets with removable keyboards  and to ultrabook laptops in the features and performance field       many major netbook producing companies stopped producing them by the end of         many netbook products were replaced on the market by chromebooks  a variation on the network computer concept in the form of a netbook  with the rise of chromebooks in       microsoft began a new effort at creating viable netbooks  with windows     with bing  hp re entered the non chromebook netbook market with the stream    in                    the origins of the netbook can be traced to the highly popular toshiba range of libretto sub notebooks  the    libretto    dates back to early      and weighed only    g  apple also had a line of powerbook duos that were ultra portable macintosh laptops in the mid   s  more recently  psion s now discontinued netbook line  the olpc xo    initially called us     laptop  and the palm foleo were all small  portable  network enabled computers        the generic use of the term  netbook   however  began in      when asus unveiled the asus eee pc  originally designed for emerging markets  the   xa cm  xa   xa cm     xa in  xa    xa in  device weighed about    xa kg   xa lb  and featured a  xa in    xa cm  display  a keyboard approximately     the size of a normal keyboard  a solid state drive and a custom version of linux with a simplified user interface geared towards netbook use    following the eee pc  everex launched its linux based cloudbook  windows xp and windows vista models were also introduced and msi released the wind others soon followed suit     the olpc project  known for its innovation in producing a durable  cost  and power efficient netbook for developing countries  is regarded as one of the major factors that led top computer hardware manufacturers to begin creating low cost netbooks for the consumer market    when the first asus eee pc sold over         units in four months  companies such as dell and acer took note and began producing their own inexpensive netbooks  and while the olpc xo   targets a different audience than do the other manufacturers  netbooks  it appears that olpc is now facing competition  developing countries now have a large choice of vendors  from which they can choose which low cost netbook they prefer       by late       netbooks had begun to take market share away from notebooks    in contrast to earlier  largely failed attempts to establish mini computers as a new class of mainstream personal computing devices built around comparatively expensive platforms requiring proprietary software applications or imposing severe usability limitations  the recent success of netbooks can also be attributed to the fact that pc technology has now matured enough to allow truly cost optimized implementations with enough performance to suit the needs of a majority of pc users  this is illustrated by the fact that typical system performance of a netbook is on the level of a mainstream pc in       at around one quarter of the cost  while this performance level suffices for most of the user needs  it caused an increased interest in resource efficient applications such as google s chrome  and forced microsoft to extend availability of windows xp to secure market share  it is estimated that almost thirty times more netbooks were sold in            million      of which were in europe    than in                   this trend is reinforced by the rise of web based applications as well as mobile networking and  according to wired magazine  netbooks are evolving into  super portable laptops for professionals     the ongoing recession is also helping with the growing sales of netbooks       in australia  the new south wales department of education and training  in partnership with lenovo  provided year    high school  students in government high schools with lenovo s  e netbooks in       lenovo mini    netbooks in       lenovo edge    netbooks in      and a modified lenovo x   e netbook in       each preloaded with software including microsoft office and adobe systems  creative suite    these were provided under prime minister kevin rudd s digital education revolution  or der  the netbooks ran windows   enterprise  these netbooks were secured with computrace lojack for laptops that the police can use to track the device if it is lost or stolen  the nsw det retains ownership of these netbooks until the student graduates from year     when the student can keep it  the government of trinidad and tobago prime minister kamla persad bisseser is also providing hp laptops to form   students     year olds  with the same police trackable software as above     greece provided all    year old students  middle school  or gymnasium  freshmen  and their teachers with netbooks in        through the  digital classroom initiative   students were given one unique coupon each  with which they redeemed the netbook of their choice  up to a      price ceiling  in participating shops throughout the country  these netbooks came bundled with localised versions of either windows xp  or higher  or open source  e g  linux  operating systems  wired and wireless networking functionality  antivirus protection  preactivated parental controls  and an educational software package     microsoft and intel have tried to  cement  netbooks in the low end of the market to protect mainstream notebook pc sales  because they get lower margins on low cost models  the companies have limited the specifications of netbooks  but despite this original equipment manufacturers have announced higher end netbooks models as of march            ending in      the report was that the typical netbook featured a    xa kg   xa lb  weight  a  xa in    xa cm  screen  wireless internet connectivity  linux or windows xp  an intel atom processor  and a cost of less than      us    a mid      newspaper article   said that a typical netbook is    xa kg     xa lb        us  and has a   xa in    xa cm  screen    gb of random access memory  a     gb hard disk drive  and a wireless transceiver for both home and a mobile network  buyers drove the netbook market towards larger screens  which grew from  xa in    xa cm  in the original asus eee pc     to   xa in      xa cm  models in the summer of            having peaked at about     of the portable computer market  netbooks started to slightly lose market share  within the category  in early       coinciding with the appearance and success of the ipad    technology commentator ross rubin argued two and a half years later in engadget that  netbooks never got any respect  while steve jobs rebuked the netbook at the ipad s introduction  the ipad owes a bit of debt to the little laptops  the netbook demonstrated the potential of an inexpensive  portable second computing device  with a screen size of about    inches  intended primarily for media consumption and light productivity     although some manufacturers directly blamed competition from the ipad  some analysts pointed out that larger  fully fledged laptops had entered the price range of netbooks at about the same time       the      inch macbook air  introduced in late       compared favorably to many netbooks in terms of processing power but also ergonomics  at     pounds being lighter than some    inch netbooks  owing in part to the integration of the flash storage chips on the main logic board    it was described as a superlative netbook  or at least as what a netbook should be  by several technology commentators        even though apple has never referred to it as such  sometimes describing it in the words of steve jobs as  the third kind of notebook     the entry level model had a msrp of         costing significantly more than the average netbook  as much as three or four times more       in      tablet sales overtook netbooks for the first time  and in      netbook sales fell by    percent  year on year    the sustained decline since      had been most pronounced in the united states and in western europe  while latin america was still showing some modest growth    in december       dell announced that it was exiting the netbook market    in may       toshiba announced it was doing the same  at least in the united states    an august      article by john c  dvorak in pc magazine claimed that the term  netbook  is  nearly gone from the lexicon already   having been superseded in the market place largely by the more powerful  and macbook air inspired  ultrabook described as  a netbook on steroids  and to a lesser extent by tablets    in september      asus  acer and msi announced that they will stop manufacturing    inch netbooks    simultaneously asus announced they would stop developing all eee pc products  instead focusing on their mixed tablet netbook transformer line       with the introduction of chromebooks  major manufacturers produced the new laptops for the same segment of the market that netbooks serviced  chromebooks  a variation on the network computer concept  in the form of a netbook  require internet connections for full functionality  chromebooks became top selling laptops in       the threat of google chrome os based chromebooks prompted microsoft to revive and revamp netbooks with windows     with bing  hp re entered the non chromebook netbook market with the stream    in            in      psion started applying for trademarks for a line of netbook products that was later released in         international trademarks were issued  including u s  trademark            and community trade mark            but the models failed to gain popularity   and are now discontinued  except for providing accessories  maintenance and support to existing users     similar marks were recently rejected by the uspto citing a  likelihood of confusion  under section   d            despite expert analysis that the mark is  probably generic     psion teklogix issued cease and desist letters on    december             this was heavily criticised        prompting the formation of the  save the netbooks  grassroots campaign which worked to reverse the google adwords ban  cancel the trademark and encourage continued generic use of the term    while preparing a  petition for cancellation  of u s  trademark            they revealed   that dell had submitted one day before   on the basis of abandonment  genericness and fraud    they later revealed psion s counter suit against intel  filed on    february            it was also revealed around the same time that intel had also sued psion teklogix  us   canada  and psion  uk  in the federal court on similar grounds    in addition to seeking cancellation of the trademark  intel sought an order enjoining psion from asserting any trademark rights in the term  netbook   a declarative judgment regarding their use of the term  attorneys  fees  costs and disbursements and  such other and further relief as the court deems just and proper        on june          psion announced that the suit had been settled out of court  psion s statement said that the company was withdrawing all of its trademark registrations for the term  netbook  and that psion agreed to  waive all its rights against third parties in respect of past  current or future use  of the term       netbooks typically have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers and do not include an optical disc drive that larger laptops often have  some netbooks do not even have a conventional hard drive    such netbooks use solid state storage devices instead  as these require less power  are faster  lighter  and generally more shock resistant  but with much less storage capacity  such as         or     gb compared to the     gb to   tb mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks laptop computers      all netbooks on the market today support wi fi wireless networking and many can be used on mobile telephone networks with data capability  for example   g   mobile data plans are supplied under contract in the same way as mobile telephones    some also include ethernet and or modem ports  for broadband or dial up internet access  respectively     it remains to be seen whether intel s new silvermont architecture  released in       will revive sales as new chips will offer far greater power using the same wattage     most netbooks  such as those from asus  benq  dell  toshiba  acer use the intel atom notebook processor  typically the n       xa ghz but also available is the n    at     xa ghz  replaced by the n    series with graphics and memory controller integrated on the chip in early      and running at     xa ghz   but the x   compatible via technologies c  processor is also powering netbooks from many different manufacturers like hp   and samsung    via has also designed the nano  a new x      compatible architecture targeting lower priced  mobile applications like netbooks  currently  one netbook uses the nano  the samsung nc    some very low cost netbooks use a system on a chip vortex   processor meant for embedded systems  just to be  windows compatible   but with very low performance  in       amd launched fusion netbook processors which are included in asus eee pc     t and many others         although not officially sanctioned by amd for this role  a    xa ghz athlon    model l    processor  dissipating   xa w  was used by at least one company gateway to power an      inch portable      x    screen resolution   described as a netbook by the press    launched in mid      at      in the united states  the lt   met with reviewers  approval for its performance  being generally recognized as faster than contemporary atom based products in the same price range  while having a considerably shorter battery life and still falling short of intel s core   ulv product line powering more expensive small factor offerings             the      inch macbook air debuted in late      with a    xa ghz core   duo processor  a   xa w part  and a     x    display resolution for its entry level model priced at       with    xa ghz available as upgrade   which put it  much closer to a fully modern laptop than the small but crippled netbooks     one reviewer described it as the  the mercedes benz of netbooks        the september      pc magazine buyer s guide for netbooks observed that other  oversized netbooks  with      inch screens had appeared on the market  including the hp pavilion dm z  msrp       and lenovo thinkpad x   e  msrp        both using the amd fusion e     processor  an   xa w part  although this includes the gpu   which was described as  faster than any given atom processor        by definition netbooks accommodate processors with little processing power  for comparison a common dual core core   duo t

and licenses microprocessor technology with relatively low power requirements and low cost which would constitute an ideal basis for netbooks  in particular  the recent arm cortex a  mpcore series of processor cores have been touted by arm as an alternative platform to x   for netbooks      in june       nvidia announced a dozen mobile internet devices running arm based tegra soc s  some of which will be netbooks       some arm based products were advertised as smartbooks  particularly by qualcomm  smartbooks promised to deliver features including always on  all day battery life   g connectivity and gps  all typically found in smartphones  in a laptop style body with a screen size of   to   xa inches and a qwerty keyboard  these systems do not run traditional x   versions of microsoft windows  rather custom linux operating systems  such as google s android or chrome os       in the end  few such products were ever shipped to market under this branding  like the hp compaq airlife    the toshiba ac     sold as dynabook az in japan    and the efika mx    some of the devices  like the ac     have been hampered by being sold with a phone oriented operating system like android    by the end of       qualcomm ceo paul jacobs admitted that tablet computers such as the ipad already occupied the niche of the smartbook  so the name was dropped       some netbooks use mips architecture compatible processors  these include the skytone alpha        based on an ingenic system on chip  and the emtec gdium netbook  which uses the    bit loongson processor capable of     million instructions per second    while these systems are relatively inexpensive  the processing power of current mips implementations usually compares unfavorably with those of x   implementations as found in current netbooks       as of november     update  customised distributions of gnu linux are estimated to ship on     of netbooks worldwide       claimed microsoft     making it the second most popular operating system after windows  as linux systems normally install software from an internet software repository  they do not need an optical drive to install software     as of august     update  major netbook manufacturers no longer install or support linux in the united states  the reason for this change of stance is unclear  although it coincides with the availability of a  netbook  version of windows xp  and a later windows   starter and a strong marketing push for the adoption of this os in the netbook market  however  companies targeting niche markets  such as system   and zareason  continue to pre install linux on the devices they sell     netbooks have sparked the development of several linux variants or completely new distributions  which are optimized for small screen use and the limited processing power of the atom or arm processors which typically power netbooks  examples include ubuntu netbook edition  easypeasy  joli os and meego  both joli os and meego purport to be  social oriented  or social networking operating systems rather than traditional  office work production  operating systems     microsoft announced on april         that  despite the impending end of retail availability for the operating system that june  it would continue to license low cost copies of windows xp home edition to oems through october       one year after the release of windows    for what it defined as  ultra low cost personal computers  a definition carrying restrictions on screen size and processing power         the move served primarily to counter the use of low cost linux distributions on netbooks and create a new market segment for windows devices  whilst ensuring that the devices did not cannibalize the sales of higher end pcs running windows vista    as of january       over          claimed by microsoft as of february       of netbooks in the united states were estimated to ship with windows xp           for windows    microsoft introduced a new stripped down edition intended for netbooks known as  starter   exclusively for oems  in comparison to home premium  starter has reduced multimedia functionality  does not allow users to change their desktop wallpaper or theme  disables the  aero glass  theme  and does not have support for multiple monitors           for windows    in a ploy to counter chrome os based netbooks and low end android tablets  microsoft began to offer no cost windows licenses to oems for devices with screens smaller than   inches in size  additionally  microsoft began to offer low cost licenses for a variant of the operating system set up to use microsoft s bing search engine by default                windows ce has also been used in netbook applications  due to its reduced feature set        google s android software platform  designed for mobile telephone handsets  has been demonstrated on an asus eee pc and its version of the linux operating system contains policies for mobile internet devices including the original asus eee pc         asus has allocated engineers to develop an android based netbook     freescale have also announced plans for a low cost arm based netbook design  running android     in may      a contractor of dell announced it is porting adobe flash lite to android for dell netbooks     acer announced android netbooks to be available in q              in july       a new project  android x       was created to provide an open source solution for android on the x   platform  especially for netbooks     since the initial work on android  google announced a netbook specific operating system  chrome os  and future operating system development may be forked into android for smartphones and similar handhelds  and chrome os for traditional keyboard driven machines like netbooks     in       google introduced chrome os  a linux based operating system designed particularly for netbook like devices marketed as  chromebooks   the platform is designed to leverage online services  cloud computing  and its namesake chrome web browser as its shell so much so that the operating system initially used a full screen web browser window as its interface  and contained limited offline functionality        later versions of chrome os introduced a traditional desktop interface    and a platform allowing  native  packaged software written in html  javascript  and css to be developed for the platform        meego is a linux based open source operating system project  it was first announced at mobile world congress in february      by intel and nokia in a joint press conference  with the stated aim being to merge the efforts of intel s moblin and nokia s maemo former projects into one new common project  it is programmed in c   and comes from linux os

darwin        the cloud operating system attempts to capitalize on the minimalist aspect of netbooks  the user interface is limited to a browser application only     mac os x has been demonstrated running on various netbooks as a result of the osx   project     although this is in violation of the operating system s end user license agreement     apple has complained to sites hosting information on how to install os x onto non apple hardware  including wired and youtube  who have reacted and removed content in response     one article nicknamed a netbook running os x a  hackintosh   the macbook air can be considered an expensive netbook     a june      npd study found that     of netbook buyers never take their netbooks out of the house        another npd study indicated that by september      netbooks accounted for     of all portable computer shipments        special  children s  editions of netbooks have been released under disney branding  their low cost  less at risk   lack of dvd player  less to break  and smaller keyboards  closer to children s hand sizes  are viewed as significant advantages for that target market  the principal objection to netbooks in this context is the lack of good video performance for streaming online video in current netbooks and a lack of speed with even simple games  adults browsing for text content are less dependent on video content than small children who cannot read     netbooks are a growing trend in education for several reasons  the need to prepare children for   st century lifestyles  combined with hundreds of new educational tools that can be found online  and a growing emphasis on student centered learning are three of the biggest contributing factors to the rising use of netbook technology in schools citation needed dell was one of the first to mass produce a ruggedised netbook for the education sector  by having a rubber outlay  touchscreen and network activity light to show the teacher the netbook is online     netbooks offer several distinct advantages in educational settings  first  their compact size and weight make for an easy fit in student work areas  similarly  the small size make netbooks easier to transport than heavier  larger sized traditional laptops  in addition  prices ranging from           mean the affordability of netbooks can be a relief to school budget makers  despite the small size and price  netbooks are fully capable of accomplishing most school related tasks  including word processing  presentations  access to the internet  multimedia playback  and
