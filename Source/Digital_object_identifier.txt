 a digital object identifier  doi  is a character string  a  digital identifier   used to uniquely identify an object such as an electronic document  metadata about the object is stored in association with the doi name and this metadata may include a location  such as a url  where the object can be found  the doi for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document  whereas its location and other metadata may change  referring to an online document by its doi provides more stable linking than simply referring to it by its url  because if its url changes  the publisher need only update the metadata for the doi to link to the new url        a doi name differs from standard identifier registries such as the isbn and isrc  the purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers  whereas the primary purpose of the doi system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable     organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the doi system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign dois   the doi system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the international doi foundation   which developed and controls the system  the doi system has been developed and implemented in a range of publishing applications since       by late april      more than    million doi names had been assigned by some       organizations   by april      this number had grown to    million doi names assigned through       organizations  the doi system uses  but is not formally part of  the handle system              a doi name takes the form of a character string divided into two parts  a prefix and a suffix  separated by a slash  the prefix identifies the registrant of the name  and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that doi  most legal unicode characters are allowed in these strings  which are interpreted in a case insensitive manner     for example  in the doi name              the prefix is         and the suffix is      the       part of the prefix identifies the doi registry a and the characters      in the prefix identify the registrant  in this case the registrant is the international doi foundation itself      is the suffix  or item id  identifying a single object  in this case  the latest version of the doi handbook   the official doi handbook explicitly states that dois should display on screens and in print in the format  doi               b    doi names can identify creative works  such as texts  images  audio or video items  and software  in both electronic and physical forms  performances  and abstract works   such as licenses  parties to a transaction  etc     the names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail  thus doi names can identify a journal  an individual issue of a journal  an individual article in the journal  or a single table in that article  the choice of level of detail is left to the assigner  but in the doi system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a doi name  using a data dictionary based on the indecs content model     major applications of the doi system currently include     in the organisation for economic co operation and development s publication service oecd ilibrary  each table or graph in an oecd publication is shown with a doi name that leads to an excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs  further development of such services is planned       a multilingual european doi registration agency activity  medra  traditional chinese content thru airiti inc  and a chinese registration agency  wanfang data  are active in non english language markets  expansion to other sectors is planned by the international doi foundation citation needed    the doi system was designed to provide a form of persistent identification  in which each doi name permanently and unambiguously identifies the object to which it is associated  and  it associates metadata with objects  allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships  included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow doi names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found  to achieve its goals  the doi system combines the handle system and the indecs content model with a social infrastructure     the handle system ensures that the doi name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership  that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its doi name  and that no two objects are assigned the same doi name  because doi names are short character strings  they are human readable  may be copied and pasted as text  and fit into the uri specification  the doi name resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes  so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service  it is built on open architectures  incorporates trust mechanisms  and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the doi system    doi name resolution may be used with openurl to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object  according to the location of the user making the request    however  despite this ability  the doi system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations       the indecs content model is used within the doi system to associate metadata with objects  a small kernel of common metadata is shared by all doi names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data  which may be public or restricted  registrants may update the metadata for their doi names at any time  such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different url     the international doi foundation  idf  oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure  the social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering doi services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as gs  and isbn     a doi name differs from commonly used internet pointers to material  such as the uniform resource locator  url   in that it identifies an object itself as a first class entity  rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time  it implements the uniform resource identifier  uniform resource name  concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure       a doi name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the isbn  isrc  etc  the purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers  whereas the primary purpose of the doi system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable  where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections       the doi system offers persistent  semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner  e g   public citation or managing content of value   it uses a managed registry  providing social and technical infrastructure   it does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways  several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed  the comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing  imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as  identifiers  doesn t mean that they can be compared easily  other  identifier systems  may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry  providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance  examples include persistent uniform resource locator  purl   urls  globally unique identifiers  guids   etc    but may lack some of the functionality of a registry controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme  the doi system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes  various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the doi system for specific sectors  e g   ark      a doi name does not depend on the object s location and  in this way  is similar to a uniform resource name  urn  or purl but differs from an ordinary url  urls are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the internet  better characterised as uniform resource identifiers  although the same document at two different locations has two urls  by contrast  persistent identifiers such as doi names identify objects as first class entities  two instances of the same object would have the same doi name     doi name resolution is provided through the handle system  developed by corporation for national research initiatives  and is freely available to any user encountering a doi name  resolution redirects the user from a doi name to one or more pieces of typed data  urls representing instances of the object  services such as e mail  or one or more items of metadata  to the handle system  a doi name is a handle  and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields  each handle value must have a data type specified in its  type  field  which defines the syntax and semantics of its data     to resolve a doi name  it may be input to a doi resolver  e g  doi org  or may be represented as an http string by preceding the doi name by the string https   doi org   preferred    or https   dx doi org   for example  the doi name             can be resolved at the address  https   doi org               web pages or other hypertext documents can include hypertext links in this form  some browsers allow the direct resolution of a doi  or other handles  with an add on  e g   cnri handle extension for firefox  the cnri handle extension for firefox enables the browser to access handle or doi uris like hdl              or doi           using the native handle system protocol  it will even replace references to web to handle proxy servers with native resolution     the international doi foundation  idf   a non profit organisation created in       is the governance body of the doi system    it safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the doi system  manages common operational features  and supports the development and promotion of the doi system  the idf ensures that any improvements made to the doi system  including creation  maintenance  registration  resolution and policymaking of doi names  are available to any doi registrant  it also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the idf on users of the doi system     the idf is controlled by a board elected by the members of the foundation  with an appointed managing agent who is responsible for co ordinating and planning its activities  membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies  the idf holds annual open meetings on the topics of doi and related issues     registration agencies  appointed by the idf  provide services to doi registrants  they allocate doi prefixes  register doi names  and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data  registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the doi system  to cooperate with the idf in the development of the doi system as a whole  and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community  a list of current ras is maintained by the international doi foundation     registration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new doi name  parts of these fees are used to support the idf  the doi system overall  through the idf  operates on a not for profit cost recovery basis     the doi system is an international standard developed by the international organization for standardization in its technical committee on identification and description  tc   sc     the draft international standard iso dis        information and documentation   digital
