 a web page  or webpage  is a web document that is suitable for the world wide web and the web browser     a web browser displays a web page on a monitor or mobile device  the web page is what displays  but the term also refers to a computer file  usually written in html or comparable markup language  web browsers coordinate the various web resource elements for the written web page  such as style sheets  scripts and images  to present the web page     typical web pages provide hypertext that include a navigation bar or a sidebar menu to other web pages via hyperlinks  often referred to as links     on a network  a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server  on a higher level  the web server may restrict access to only a private network such as a corporate intranet or it provides access to the world wide web  on a lower level  the web browser uses the hypertext transfer protocol  http  to make such requests     a static web page is delivered exactly as stored  as web content in the web server s file system  while a dynamic web page is generated by a web application that is driven by server side software or client side scripting  dynamic web pages help the browser  the client  to enhance the web page through user input to the server             web pages usually include information as to the colours of text and backgrounds and very often also contain links to images and sometimes other types of media to be included in the final view  layout  typographic and color scheme information is provided by cascading style sheet  css  instructions  which can either be embedded in the html or can be provided by a separate file  which is referenced from within the html  the latter case is especially relevant where one lengthy stylesheet is relevant to a whole website  due to the way http works  the browser will only download it once from the web server and use the cached copy for the whole site     images are stored on the web server as separate files  but again http allows for the fact that once a web page is downloaded to a browser  it is quite likely that related files such as images and stylesheets will be requested as it is processed  an http     web server will maintain a connection with the browser until all related resources have been requested and provided  web browsers usually render images along with the text and other material on the displayed web page     client side computer code such as javascript or code implementing ajax techniques can be provided either embedded in the html of a web page or  like css stylesheets  as separate  linked downloads specified in the html  these scripts may run on the client computer  if the user allows     a web browser can have a graphical user interface  like internet explorer  mozilla firefox  chrome and opera  or can be text based  like lynx or links     web users with disabilities often use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to access web pages   users may be color blind  may or may not want to use a mouse perhaps due to repetitive stress injury or motor neurone problems  may be deaf and require audio to be captioned  may be blind and using a screen reader or braille display  may need screen magnification  etc     disabled and able bodied users may disable the download and viewing of images and other media  to save time  network bandwidth or merely to simplify their browsing experience  users of mobile devices often have restricted displays and bandwidth  anyone may prefer not to use the fonts  font sizes  styles and color schemes selected by the web page designer and may apply their own css styling to the page  the world wide web consortium  w c  and web accessibility initiative  wai  recommend that all web pages should be designed with all of these options in mind     a web page  as an information set  can contain numerous types of information  which is able to be seen  heard or interacted with by the end user     the web page can also contain dynamically adapted information elements  dependent upon the rendering browser or end user location  through the use of ip address tracking and or  cookie  information   from a more general wide point of view  some information  grouped  elements  like a navigation bar  are uniform for all website pages  like a standard  these kind of  website standard information  are supplied by technologies like web template systems     web pages will often require more screen space than is available for a particular display resolution  most modern browsers will place a scrollbar  a sliding tool at the side of the screen that allows the user to move the page up or down  or side to side  in the window to allow the user to see all content  scrolling horizontally is less prevalent than vertical scrolling  not only because such pages often do not print properly  but because it inconveniences the user more so than vertical scrolling would  because lines are horizontal  scrolling back and forth for every line is much more inconvenient than scrolling after reading a whole screen  also most computer keyboards have page up and down keys  and many computer mice have vertical scroll wheels  but the horizontal scrolling equivalents are rare   when web pages are stored in a common directory of a web server  they become a website     a website will typically contain a group of web pages that are linked together  or have some other coherent method of navigation  the most important web page to have on a website is the index page  depending on the web server settings  this index page can have many different names  but the most common is index html  when a browser visits the homepage for a website  or any url pointing to a directory rather than a specific file  the web server will serve the index page to the requesting browser  if no index page is defined in the configuration  or no such file exists on the server  either an error or directory listing will be served to the browser  a web page can either be a single html file  or made up of several html files using frames or server side includes  ssis      frames have been known to cause problems with web accessibility  copyright   navigation  printing and search engine rankings  and are now less often used than they were in the     s   both frames and ssis allow certain content which appears on many pages  such as page navigation or page headers  to be repeated without duplicating the html in many files  frames and the w c recommended alternative of       the  object  tag   also allow some content to remain in one place while other content can be scrolled using conventional scrollbars  modern css and javascript client side techniques can also achieve all of these goals and more     when creating a web page  it is important to ensure it conforms to the world wide web consortium  w c  standards for html  css  xml and other standards  the w c standards are in place to ensure all browsers which conform to their standards can display identical content without any special consideration for proprietary rendering techniques  a properly coded web page is going to be accessible to many different browsers old and new alike  display resolutions  as well as those users with audio or visual impairments     typically  web pages today are becoming more dynamic  a dynamic web page is one that is created server side when it is requested  and then served to the end user  these types of web pages typically do not have a permalink  or a static url  associated with them  today  this can be seen in many popular forums  online shopping  and even on wikipedia  this practice is intended to reduce the amount of static pages in lieu of storing the relevant web page information in a database  some search engines may have a hard time indexing a web page that is dynamic  so static web pages can be provided in those instances     in order to graphically display a web page  a web browser is needed  this is a type of software that can retrieve web pages from the internet  most current web browsers include the ability to view the source code  viewing a web page in a text editor will also display the source code     to create a web page  a text editor or a specialized html editor is needed  in order to upload the created web page to a web server  traditionally an ftp client is needed     the design of a web page is highly personal  a design can be made according to one s own preference  or a premade web template can be used  web templates let web page designers edit the content of a web page without having to worry about the overall aesthetics  many people turn to all in one sites for web domain purchases  web hosting service and templates to build customised websites  web publishing tools such as tripod and wordpress offer free page creation and hosting up to a certain size limit  other ways of making a web page is to download specialized software  like a wiki  cms  or forum  these options allow for quick and easy creation of a web page which is typically dynamic     while one is viewing a web page  a copy of it is saved locally  this is what is being viewed  depending on the browser settings  this copy may be deleted at any time  or stored indefinitely  sometimes without the user realizing it  most gui browsers provide options for saving a web page more permanently  these may include     most operating systems allow applications such as web browsers not only to print the currently viewed web page to a printer  but optionally to  print  to a file that can be viewed or printed later  some web pages are designed  for example by use of css  so that hyperlinks  menus and other navigation items  which will be useless on paper  are rendered into print with this in mind  sometimes  the destination addresses of hyperlinks may be shown explicitly  either within the body of the page or listed at the end of the printed version  web page designers may specify in css that non functional menus  navigational blocks and other items may simply be absent from the printed version
