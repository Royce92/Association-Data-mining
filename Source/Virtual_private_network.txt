 a virtual private network  vpn  extends a private network across a public network  such as the internet  it enables a computer or network enabled device to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if it were directly connected to the private network  while benefiting from the functionality  security and management policies of the public network   a vpn is created by establishing a virtual point to point connection through the use of dedicated connections  virtual tunneling protocols  or traffic encryption  major implementations of vpns include openvpn and ipsec     a vpn connection across the internet is similar to a wide area network  wan  link between websites  from a user perspective  the extended network resources are accessed in the same way as resources available within the private network   one major limitation of traditional vpns is that they are point to point  and do not tend to support or connect broadcast domains  therefore communication  software  and networking  which are based on layer   and broadcast packets  such as netbios used in windows networking  may not be fully supported or work exactly as they would on a real lan  variants on vpn  such as virtual private lan service  vpls   and layer   tunneling protocols  are designed to overcome this limitation     vpns allow employees to securely access their company s intranet while traveling outside the office  similarly  vpns securely connect geographically separated offices of an organization  creating one cohesive network  vpn technology is also used by individual internet users to secure their wireless transactions  to circumvent geo restrictions and censorship  and to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location citation needed            early data networks allowed vpn style remote connectivity through dial up modems or through leased line connections utilizing frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode  atm  virtual circuits  provisioned through a network owned and operated by telecommunication carriers  these networks are not considered true vpns because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams   they have been replaced by vpns based on ip and ip multiprotocol label switching  mpls  networks  due to significant cost reductions and increased bandwidth  provided by new technologies such as digital subscriber line  dsl   and fiber optic networks     vpns can be either remote access  connecting a computer to a network  or site to site  connecting two networks   in a corporate setting  remote access vpns allow employees to access their company s intranet from home or while traveling outside the office  and site to site vpns allow employees in geographically disparate offices to share one cohesive virtual network  a vpn can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar middle network  for example  two ipv  networks over an ipv  network      vpn systems may be classified by     vpns cannot make online connections completely anonymous  but they can usually increase privacy and security   to prevent disclosure of private information  vpns typically allow only authenticated remote access and make use of encryption techniques     vpns provide security by the use of tunneling protocols and often through procedures such as encryption  the vpn security model provides     secure vpn protocols include the following     tunnel endpoints must be authenticated before secure vpn tunnels can be established  user created remote access vpns may use passwords  biometrics  two factor authentication or other cryptographic methods  network to network tunnels often use passwords or digital certificates  they permanently store the key to allow the tunnel to establish automatically  without intervention from the user     tunneling protocols can operate in a point to point network topology that would theoretically not be considered a vpn  because a vpn by definition is expected to support arbitrary and changing sets of network nodes  but since most router implementations support a software defined tunnel interface  customer provisioned vpns often are simply defined tunnels running conventional routing protocols     depending on whether a provider provisioned vpn  ppvpn clarification needed operates in layer   or layer    the building blocks described below may be l  only  l  only  or combine them both  multiprotocol label switching  mpls  functionality blurs the l  l  identity citation neededoriginal research     rfc      generalized the following terms to cover l  and l  vpns  but they were introduced in rfc         more information on the devices below can also be found in lewis  cisco press       a device that is within a customer s network and not directly connected to the service provider s network  c devices are not aware of the vpn     a device at the edge of the customer s network which provides access to the ppvpn  sometimes it s just a demarcation point between provider and customer responsibility  other providers allow customers to configure it     a pe is a device  or set of devices  at the edge of the provider network which connects to customer networks through ce devices and presents the provider s view of the customer site  pes are aware of the vpns that connect through them  and maintain vpn state     a p device operates inside the provider s core network and does not directly interface to any customer endpoint  it might  for example  provide routing for many provider operated tunnels that belong to different customers  ppvpns  while the p device is a key part of implementing ppvpns  it is not itself vpn aware and does not maintain vpn state  its principal role is allowing the service provider to scale its ppvpn offerings  for example  by acting as an aggregation point for multiple pes  p to p connections  in such a role  often are high capacity optical links between major locations of providers     this section deals with the types of vpn considered in the ietf     a layer   technique that allow for the coexistence of multiple lan broadcast domains  interconnected via trunks using the ieee      q trunking protocol  other trunking protocols have been used but have become obsolete  including inter switch link  isl   ieee         originally a security protocol but a subset was introduced for trunking   and atm lan emulation  lane      developed by ieee  vlans allow multiple tagged lans to share common trunking  vlans frequently comprise only customer owned facilities  whereas vpls as described in the above section  osi layer   services  supports emulation of both point to point and point to multipoint topologies  the method discussed here extends layer   technologies such as      d and      q lan trunking to run over transports such as metro ethernet     as used in this context  a vpls is a layer   ppvpn  rather than a private line  emulating the full functionality of a traditional local area network  lan   from a user standpoint  a vpls makes it possible to interconnect several lan segments over a packet switched  or optical  provider core  a core transparent to the user  making the remote lan segments behave as one single lan       in a vpls  the provider network emulates a learning bridge  which optionally may include vlan service     pw is similar to vpls  but it can provide different l  protocols at both ends  typically  its interface is a wan protocol such as asynchronous transfer mode or frame relay  in contrast  when aiming to provide the appearance of a lan contiguous between two or more locations  the virtual private lan service or ipls would be appropriate     etherip  rfc       is an ethernet over ip tunneling protocol specification  etherip has only packet encapsulation mechanism  it has no confidentiality nor message integrity protection  etherip was introduced in the freebsd network stack    and the softether vpn   server program     a subset of vpls  the ce devices must have l  capabilities  the ipls presents packets rather than frames  it may support ipv  or ipv      this section discusses the main architectures for ppvpns  one where the pe disambiguates duplicate addresses in a single routing instance  and the other  virtual router  in which the pe contains a virtual router instance per vpn  the former approach  and its variants  have gained the most attention     one of the challenges of ppvpns involves different customers using the same address space  especially the ipv  private address space    the provider must be able to disambiguate overlapping addresses in the multiple customers  ppvpns     in the method defined by rfc       bgp extensions advertise routes in the ipv  vpn address family  which are of the form of    byte strings  beginning with an   byte route distinguisher  rd  and ending with a   byte ipv  address  rds disambiguate otherwise duplicate addresses in the same pe     pes understand the topology of each vpn  which are interconnected with mpls tunnels  either directly or via p routers  in mpls terminology  the p routers are label switch routers without awareness of vpns     the virtual router architecture      as opposed to bgp mpls techniques  requires no modification to existing routing protocols such as bgp  by the provisioning of logically independent routing domains  the customer operating a vpn is completely responsible for the address space  in the various mpls tunnels  the different ppvpns are disambiguated by their label  but do not need routing distinguishers     some virtual networks may not use encryption to protect the privacy of data  while vpns often provide security  an unencrypted overlay network does not neatly fit within the secure or trusted categorization  for example  a tunnel set up between two hosts that used generic routing encapsulation  gre  would in fact be a virtual private network  but neither secure nor trusted     native plaintext tunneling protocols include layer   tunneling protocol  l tp  when it is set up without ipsec and point to point tunneling protocol  pptp  or microsoft point to point encryption  mppe      trusted vpns do not use cryptographic tunneling  and instead rely on the security of a single provider s network to protect the traffic       from the security standpoint  vpns either trust the underlying delivery network  or must enforce security with mechanisms in the vpn itself  unless the trusted delivery network runs among physically secure sites only  both trusted and secure models need an authentication mechanism for users to gain access to the vpn     mobile vpns are used in a setting where an endpoint of the vpn is not fixed to a single ip address  but instead roams across various networks such as data networks from cellular carriers or between multiple wi fi access points    mobile vpns have been widely used in public safety  where they give law enforcement officers access to mission critical applications  such as computer assisted dispatch and criminal databases  while they travel between different subnets of a mobile network    they are also used in field service management and by healthcare organizations    among other industries     increasingly  mobile vpns are being adopted by mobile professionals who need reliable connections    they are used for roaming seamlessly across networks and in and out of wireless coverage areas without losing application sessions or dropping the secure vpn session  a conventional vpn cannot survive such events because the network tunnel is disrupted  causing applications to disconnect  time out    or fail  or even cause the computing device itself to crash       instead of logically tying the endpoint of the network tunnel to the physical ip address  each tunnel is bound to a permanently associated ip address at the device  the mobile vpn software handles the necessary network authentication and maintains the network sessions in a manner transparent to the application and the user    the host identity protocol  hip   under study by the internet engineering task force  is designed to support mobility of hosts by separating the role of ip addresses for host identification from their locator functionality in an ip network  with hip a mobile host maintains its logical connections established via the host identity identifier while associating with different ip addresses when roaming between access networks     with the increasing use of vpns  many have started deploying vpn connectivity on routers for additional security and encryption of data transmission by using various cryptographic techniques  setting up vpn services on a router will allow any connected device s  to use the vpn network while it is enabled  this also makes it easy to set up vpns on devices that do not have native vpn clients such as smart tvs  gaming consoles etc  provisioning vpn on the routers will also help in cost savings and network scalability     many router manufacturers like cisco linksys  asus and netgear supply their routers with built in vpn clients  since these routers do not support all the major vpn protocols  such as openvpn  many tend to flash their routers with alternative open source firmwares such as dd wrt  openwrt and tomato which support multiple vpn protocols such as pptp and openvpn     limitations     not every router is compatible with open source firmware which depends on the built in flash memory and processor  firmwares like dd wrt require a minimum of   mib flash memory and broadcom chipsets  setting up vpn services on a router requires a deeper knowledge of network security and careful installation  minor misconfiguration of vpn connections can leave the network vulnerable  performance will vary depending on the isp and their reliability           one major limitation of traditional vpns is that they are point to point  and do not tend to support or connect broadcast domains  therefore communication  software  and networking  which are based on layer   and broadcast packets  such as netbios used in windows networking  may not be fully supported or work exactly as they would on a real lan  variants on vpn  such as virtual private lan service  vpls   and layer   tunneling protocols  are designed to overcome this limitation
