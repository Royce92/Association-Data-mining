 in alternating current  ac   the flow of electric charge periodically reverses direction  whereas in direct current  dc  also dc   the flow of electric charge is only in one direction  the abbreviations ac and dc are often used to mean simply alternating and direct  as when they modify current or voltage       ac is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences  the usual waveform of an ac power circuit is a sine wave  in certain applications  different waveforms are used  such as triangular or square waves  audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current  in these applications  an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded  or modulated  onto the ac signal     ac voltage may be increased or decreased with a transformer  use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power  the power losses    in a conductor are a product of the square of the current  i  and the resistance  r  of the conductor  described by the formula    this means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire  if the current is doubled  the power loss will be four times greater     the power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage  assuming no phase difference   that is     thus  the same amount of power can be transmitted with a lower current by increasing the voltage  it is therefore advantageous when transmitting large amounts of power to distribute the power with high voltages  often hundreds of kilovolts      however  high voltages also have disadvantages  the main one being the increased insulation required  and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling  in a power plant  power is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a generator  and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission  near the loads  the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment  consumer voltages vary depending on the country and size of load  but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases     the utilization voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized  with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate  standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different mains power systems found in the world     modern high voltage direct current  hvdc  electric power transmission systems contrast with the more common alternating current systems as a means for the efficient bulk transmission of electrical power over long distances  hvdc systems  however  tend to be more expensive and less efficient over shorter distances than transformers citation needed transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible when edison  westinghouse and tesla were designing their power systems  since there was then no way to economically convert ac power to dc and back again at the necessary voltages     three phase electrical generation is very common  the simplest case is three separate coils in the generator stator that are physically offset by an angle of      to each other  three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and      out of phase to each other  if coils are added opposite to these      spacing   they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together     in practice  higher  pole orders  are commonly used  for example  a    pole machine would have    coils      spacing   the advantage is that lower speeds can be used  for example  a   pole machine running at      rpm and a    pole machine running at     rpm produce the same frequency  this is much more practical for larger machines     if the load on a three phase system is balanced equally among the phases  no current flows through the neutral point  even in the worst case unbalanced  linear  load  the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents  non linear loads  e g   computers  may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics  harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors     for three phase at utilization voltages a four wire system is often used  when stepping down three phase  a transformer with a delta    wire  primary and a star    wire  center earthed  secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side     for smaller customers  just how small varies by country and age of the installation  only a single phase and the neutral or two phases and the neutral are taken to the property  for larger installations all three phases and the neutral are taken to the main distribution panel  from the three phase main panel  both single and three phase circuits may lead off     three wire single phase systems  with a single center tapped transformer giving two live conductors  is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in north america  this arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as  two phase   a similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the uk  small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center tapped transformer with a voltage of    v between each power conductor and earth  this significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of     v between the two conductors for running the tools     a third wire  called the bond  or earth  wire  is often connected between non current carrying metal enclosures and earth ground  this conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools  bonding all non current carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault  this low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current  causing the overcurrent protection device  breakers  fuses  to trip or burn out as quickly as possible  bringing the electrical system to a safe state  all bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel  as is the neutral identified conductor if present     the frequency of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country  most electric power is generated at either    or   xa hertz  some countries have a mixture of   xa hz and   xa hz supplies  notably electricity power transmission in japan     a low frequency eases the design of electric motors  particularly for hoisting  crushing and rolling applications  and commutator type traction motors for applications such as railways  however  low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs  the use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses  which are proportional to frequency  the original niagara falls generators were built to produce   xa hz power  as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors  while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate  although with noticeable flicker   most of the   xa hz residential and commercial customers for niagara falls power were converted to   xa hz by the late     s  although somewhich    xa hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the   st century      xa hz power  formerly       xa hz  is still used in some european rail systems  such as in austria  germany  norway  sweden and switzerland     off shore  military  textile industry  marine  aircraft  and spacecraft applications sometimes use    xa hz  for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds     computer mainframe systems are often powered by    xa hz  using customer supplied    or    kva motor generator sets   smaller mainframes may have an internal    xa hz m g set  in any case  the input to the m g set is the local customary voltage and frequency  variously      japan             north america            or      europe  volts  and variously    or   xa hz     a direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross section of a uniform wire  an alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire s center  toward its outer surface  this is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity toward the center of materials with high conductivity  this phenomenon is called skin effect     at very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire  but effectively flows on the surface of the wire  within a thickness of a few skin depths  the skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by      even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission       xa hz   non uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors  for example  the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately     xa mm at   xa hz  so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost     since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors  the effective cross section of the conductor is reduced  this increases the effective ac resistance of the conductor  since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area  the ac resistance often is many times higher than the dc resistance  causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating  also called i r loss      for low to medium frequencies  conductors can be divided into stranded wires  each insulated from one other  and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle  wire constructed using this technique is called litz wire  this measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors  litz wire is used for making high q inductors  reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies  and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current  up to hundreds of kilohertz   such as switch mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers     as written above  an alternating current is made of electric charge under periodic acceleration  which causes radiation of electromagnetic waves  energy that is radiated is lost  depending on the frequency  different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation     at frequencies up to about  xa ghz  pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable  forming a twisted pair  this reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling  a twisted pair must be used with a balanced signalling system  so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents  each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal  but it is effectively cancelled by radiation from the other wire  resulting in almost no radiation loss     coaxial cables are commonly used at audio frequencies and above for convenience  a coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube  separated by a dielectric layer  the current flowing on the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the tube  the electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube  and  ideally  no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube  coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about  xa ghz  for microwave frequencies greater than  xa ghz  the losses  due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor  become too large  making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy  coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss     waveguides are similar to coax cables  as both consist of tubes  with the biggest difference being that the waveguide has no inner conductor  waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section  but rectangular cross sections are the most common  because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current  waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current  but rather by means of a guided electromagnetic field  although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides  those surface currents do not carry power  power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields  the surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide     waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted  so they are only feasible at microwave frequencies  in addition to this mechanical feasibility  electrical resistance of the non ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide cause dissipation of power  surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power   at higher frequencies  the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large     at frequencies greater than    xa ghz  waveguide dimensions become impractically small  and the ohmic losses in the waveguide walls become large  instead  fiber optics  which are a form of dielectric waveguides  can be used  for such frequencies  the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used     alternating currents are accompanied  or caused  by alternating voltages  an ac voltage v can be described mathematically as a function of time by the following equation     where    the peak to peak value of an ac voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak  since the maximum value of  is    and the minimum value is     an ac voltage swings between  and   the peak to peak voltage  usually written as  or   is therefore      the relationship between voltage and the power delivered is    rather than using instantaneous power    it is more practical to use a time averaged power  where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles   therefore  ac voltage is often expressed as a root mean square  rms  value  written as   because    by the following trigonometric identity  the power oscillation is double frequency of the voltage     for a sinusoidal voltage     the factor  is called the crest factor  which varies for different waveforms     to illustrate these concepts  consider a    xa v ac mains supply used in many countries around the world  it is so called because its root mean square value is    xa v  this means that the time averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a dc voltage of     v  to determine the peak voltage  amplitude   we can rearrange the above equation to     for    xa v ac  the peak voltage  is therefore   which is about    xa v     the first alternator to produce alternating current was a dynamo electric generator based on michael faraday s principles constructed by the french instrument maker hippolyte pixii in        pixii later added a commutator to his device to produce the  then  more commonly used direct current  the earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by guillaume duchenne  inventor and developer of electrotherapy  in       he announced that ac was superior to direct current for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions      alternating current technology had first developed in europe due to the work of guillaume duchenne      s   the hungarian ganz works      s   sebastian ziani de ferranti      s   lucien gaulard  and galileo ferraris     in       russian engineer pavel yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of ac  the secondary windings could be connected to several  electric candles   arc lamps  of his own design    the coils yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers      in       the ganz factory  budapest  hungary  began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and  by       had installed over fifty systems in austria hungary  their ac systems used arc and incandescent lamps  generators  and other equipment      a power transformer developed by lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs was demonstrated in london in       and attracted the interest of westinghouse  they also exhibited the invention in turin in          during the initial years of electricity distribution  edison s direct current was the standard for the united states  and edison did not want to lose all his patent royalties   direct current worked well with incandescent lamps  which were the principal load of the day  and with motors  direct current systems could be directly used with storage batteries  providing valuable load leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation  direct current generators could be easily paralleled  allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability  at the introduction of edison s system  no practical ac motor was available  edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption  but this meter worked only with direct current     the principal drawback of direct current distribution was that customer loads  distribution and generation were all at the same voltage  generally  it was uneconomical to use a high voltage for transmission and reduce it for customer uses  even with the edison   wire system  placing two     volt customer loads in series on a     volt supply   the high cost of conductors required generation to be close to customer loads  otherwise losses made the system uneconomical to operate     alternating current systems can use transformers to change voltage from low to high level and back  allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission  possibly over great distances  at high voltage  with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses     a bipolar open core power transformer developed by lucien gaulard and john dixon gibbs was demonstrated in london in       and attracted the interest of westinghouse  they also exhibited the invention in turin in       however these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads  until about       the paradigm for ac power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit  open core transformers with a ratio near     were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps  the inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp  or other electric device  affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit  many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit  including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil   nthe direct current systems did not have these drawbacks  giving it significant advantages over early ac systems     in the autumn of       k roly zipernowsky  ott  bl thy and miksa d ri  zbd   three engineers associated with the ganz factory  had determined that open core devices were impracticable  as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage    in their joint      patent applications for novel transformers  later called zbd transformers   they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a  wound around iron wire ring core or b xa surrounded by iron wire core    in both designs  the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core  with no intentional path through air  see toroidal cores below   the new transformers were     times more efficient than the open core bipolar devices of gaulard and gibbs       the ganz factory in      shipped the world s first five high efficiency ac transformers    this first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications        w    xa hz         v            a  ratio         one phase  shell form       the zbd patents included two other major interrelated innovations  one concerning the use of parallel connected  instead of series connected  utilization loads  the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher  initially       to       v  than the voltage of utilization loads      v initially preferred       when employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems  closed core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes  businesses and public spaces         the other essential milestone was the introduction of  voltage source  voltage intensive   vsvi  systems    by the invention of constant voltage generators in         ott  bl thy also invented the first ac electricity meter             the ac power systems was developed and adopted rapidly after      due to its ability to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances  overcoming the limitations of the direct current system  in       the zbd engineers designed  and the ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for  the world s first power station that used ac generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network  the steam powered rome cerchi power plant    the reliability of the ac technology received impetus after the ganz works electrified a large european metropolis  rome in            in the uk sebastian de ferranti  who had been developing ac generators and transformers in london since       redesigned the ac system at the grosvenor gallery power station in      for the london electric supply corporation  lesco  including alternators of his own design and transformer designs similar to gaulard and gibbs    in      he designed their power station at deptford   and converted the grosvenor gallery station across the thames into an electrical substation  showing the way to integrate older plants into a universal ac supply system       in the us william stanley  jr  designed one of the first practical devices to transfer ac power efficiently between isolated circuits  using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core  his design  called an induction coil  was an early        transformer  stanley also worked on engineering and adapting european designs such as the gaulard and gibbs transformer for us entrepreneur george westinghouse who started building ac systems in       the spread of westinghouse and other ac systems triggered a push back in late      by thomas edison  a proponent of direct current  who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the  war of currents      in      alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional ac motor  something these systems had lacked up till then  the design  an induction motor  was independently invented by galileo ferraris and nikola tesla  with tesla s design being licensed by westinghouse in the us   this design was further developed into the modern practical three phase form by mikhail dolivo dobrovolsky and charles eugene lancelot brown       the ames hydroelectric generating plant  spring of       and the original niagara falls adams power plant  august           were among the first hydroelectric ac power plants  the first commercial power plant in the united states using three phase alternating current was the hydroelectric mill creek no    hydroelectric plant near redlands  california  in      designed by almirian decker  decker s design incorporated        volt three phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation  transmission and motors used today     the jaruga hydroelectric power plant in croatia was set in operation on    august       the two generators    xa hz     xa kw each  and the transformers were produced and installed by the hungarian company ganz  the transmission line from the power plant to the city of  ibenik was      kilometers     xa mi  long on wooden towers  and the municipal distribution grid      v     v included six transforming stations     alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the   th and early   th century  notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include charles steinmetz  oliver heaviside  and many others      calculations in unbalanced three phase systems were simplified by the symmetrical components methods discussed by charles legeyt fortescue in
