american settlers migrated from siberia by way of the bering land bridge approximately        or more years ago        some  such as the pre columbian mississippian culture  developed advanced agriculture  grand architecture  and state level societies  after european explorers and traders made the first contacts  the native population declined for various reasons  including diseases  such as smallpox and measles      and violence           in the early days of colonization many settlers were subject to food shortages  disease and attacks from native americans  native americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with europeans in their colonial wars    at the same time  however  many natives and settlers came to depend on each other  settlers traded for food and animal pelts  natives for guns  ammunition and other european wares    natives taught many settlers where  when and how to cultivate corn  beans and squash  european missionaries and others felt it was important to  civilize  the indians and urged them to concentrate on farming and ranching rather than depending on hunting and gathering         after columbus  first voyage to the new world in       other explorers followed with settlement into the floridas and the american southwest      there were also some french attempts to colonize the east coast  and later more successful settlements along the mississippi river  successful english settlement on the eastern coast of north america began with the virginia colony in      at jamestown and the pilgrims  plymouth colony in       early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings    many settlers were dissenting christian groups who came seeking religious freedom  the continent s first elected legislative assembly  virginia s house of burgesses created in       and the mayflower compact  signed by the pilgrims before disembarking  established precedents for the pattern of representative self government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the american colonies         most settlers in every colony were small farmers  but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements  cash crops included tobacco  rice and wheat  extraction industries grew up in furs  fishing and lumber  manufacturers produced rum and ships  and by the late colonial period americans were producing one seventh of the world s iron supply    cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs  english colonists were supplemented by waves of scotch irish and other groups  as coastal land grew more expensive freed indentured servants pushed further west    slave cultivation of cash crops began with the spanish in the     s  and was adopted by the english  but life expectancy was much higher in north america because of less disease and better food and treatment  leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves        colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice      but by the turn of the   th century  african slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor  especially in southern regions       with the colonization of georgia in       the    colonies that would become the united

british forces seized canada from the french  but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies  excluding the native americans  who were being conquered and displaced  those    colonies had a population of over     million in       about one third that of britain  despite continuing new arrivals  the rate of natural increase was such that by the     s only a small minority of americans had been born overseas    the colonies  distance from britain had allowed the development of self government  but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority       the american revolutionary war was the first successful colonial war of independence against a european power  americans had developed an ideology of  republicanism  asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures  they demanded their rights as englishmen   no taxation without representation   the british insisted on administering the empire through parliament  and the conflict escalated into war    following the passage of the lee resolution  on july          which was the actual vote for independence  the congress adopted the declaration of independence  on july    which proclaimed  in a long preamble  that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by great britain  and finally declared  in the words of the resolution  that the thirteen colonies were independent states and had no allegiance to the british crown in the united states  july fourth is celebrated annually as independence day  in       the articles of confederation established a weak government that operated until            britain recognized the

slave populations       americans  eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of american indian wars    the louisiana purchase of french claimed territory in      almost doubled the nation s size    the war of       declared against britain over various grievances and fought to a draw  strengthened u s  nationalism    a series of u s  military incursions into florida led spain to cede it

present day american northwest    victory in the mexican american war resulted in the      mexican cession of california and much of the present day american southwest       the california gold rush of         spurred western migration and the creation of additional western states    after the american civil war  new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers  expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with native americans    over a half century  the loss of the buffalo was an existential blow to many plains indians cultures    in       a new peace policy sought to protect native americans from abuses  avoid further warfare  and secure their eventual u s  citizenship        from the beginning of the united states  inherent divisions over slavery between the north and the south in american society ultimately led to the american civil war     initially  states entering the union alternated between slave and free states  keeping a sectional balance in the senate  while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the house of representatives  but with additional western territory and more free soil states  tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories  whether and how to expand or restrict slavery        with the      election of abraham lincoln  the first president from the largely anti slavery republican party  conventions in thirteen states ultimately declared secession and formed the confederate states of america  while the u s  federal government maintained that secession was illegal     the ensuing war was at first for union  then after      as casualties mounted and lincoln delivered his emancipation proclamation  a second war aim became abolition of slavery  the war remains the deadliest military conflict in american history  resulting in the deaths of approximately         soldiers as well as many civilians        following the union victory in       three amendments to the u s  constitution brought about the prohibition of slavery  gave u s  citizenship to the nearly four million african americans who had been slaves     and promised them voting rights  the war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power    aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves     but following the reconstruction era  throughout the south jim crow laws soon effectively disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites  over the subsequent decades  in both the north and the south blacks and some whites faced systemic discrimination  including racial segregation and occasional vigilante violence  sparking national movements against these abuses        in the north  urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from southern and eastern europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country s industrialization and transformed its culture     national infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the american old west  the later invention of electric light and the telephone would also impact communication and urban life     the end of the indian wars further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation  increasing surpluses for international markets
