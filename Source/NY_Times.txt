decisions supporting freedom of the press  new york times co  v  sullivan  in it  the united states supreme court established the  actual malice  standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous  the malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity  because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff  and difficulty in proving what is inside a person s head  such cases by public figures rarely succeed       in       the pentagon papers  a secret united states department of defense history of the united states  political and military involvement in the vietnam war from      to       were given   leaked   to neil sheehan of the new york times by former state department official daniel ellsberg  with his friend anthony russo assisting in copying them  the new york times began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on june     controversy and lawsuits followed  the papers revealed  among other things  that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over laos  raids along the coast of north vietnam  and offensive actions taken by u s  marines well before the public was told about the actions  all while president lyndon b  johnson had been promising not to expand the war  the document increased the credibility gap for the u s  government  and hurt efforts by the nixon administration to fight the ongoing war       when the new york times began publishing its series  president richard nixon became incensed  his words to national security advisor henry kissinger included  people have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing     and  let s get the son of a bitch in jail     after failing to get the new york times to stop publishing  attorney general john mitchell and president nixon obtained a federal court injunction that the new york times cease publication of excerpts  the newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system  on june           the washington post began publishing its own series  ben bagdikian  a post editor  had obtained portions of the papers from ellsberg  that day the post received a call from the assistant attorney general  william rehnquist  asking them to stop publishing  when the post refused  the u s  justice department sought another injunction  the u s  district court judge refused  and the government appealed  on june          the u s  supreme court agreed to take both cases  merging them into new york times co  v  united states     us      on june           the supreme court held in a     decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required  the justices wrote nine separate opinions  disagreeing on significant substantive issues  while it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the first amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech  many felt it a lukewarm victory  offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake       discriminatory practices restricting women in editorial positions were part of the history  correlating with effects on the journalism published at the time  the newspaper s first general woman reporter was jane grant  who described her experience afterwards  she wrote   in the beginning i was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired   other reporters nicknamed her fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing  because of her gender  promotions were out of the question  according to the then managing editor  she was there for fifteen years  interrupted by world war i       in       anne mccormick wrote to arthur hays sulzberger   i hope you won t expect me to revert to  woman s point of view  stuff     later  she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues did  even those who witnessed her in action were unable to explain how she got the interviews she did    clifton daniel said   after world war ii  i m sure adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch  she never had to grovel for an appointment     covering world leaders  speeches after world war ii at the national press club was limited to men by a club rule  when women were eventually allowed in to hear the speeches  they still were not allowed to ask the speakers questions  although men were allowed and did ask  even though some of the women had won pulitzer prizes for prior work    times reporter maggie hunter refused to return to the club after covering one speech on assignment    nan robertson s article on the union stock yards  chicago  was read aloud as anonymous by a professor  who then said    it will come as a surprise to you  perhaps  that the reporter is a girl   he began    gasps  amazement in the ranks   she had used all her senses  not just her eyes  to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards  she chose a difficult subject  an offensive subject  her imagery was strong enough to revolt you      the new york times hired kathleen mclaughlin after ten years at the chicago tribune  where  she did a series on maids  going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs        in february       the paper stopped offering lifelong positions for its journalists and editors       in       adolph ochs bought the new york times  a money losing newspaper  and formed the new york times company

exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of class b voting shares  class a shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights while class b shareholders are allowed open voting rights     the ochs sulzberger family trust controls roughly    percent of the company s class b shares  any alteration to the dual class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit

jr  and cathy j  sulzberger       turner catledge  the top editor at the new york times from      to       wanted to hide the ownership influence  arthur sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor  each containing suggestions  instructions  complaints  and orders  when catledge would receive these memos he would erase the publisher s identity before passing them to his subordinates  catledge thought that if he removed the publisher s name from the memos it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner       on january           the new york times reported that carlos slim  mexican telecommunications magnate and the world s second richest person    loaned it      million  to help the newspaper company finance its businesses     since then  slim has made additional investments in times stock  according to reuters  his position as of october          was estimated at over     percent of class a shares       dual class structures caught on in the mid   th century as families such as the grahams of the washington post company sought to gain access to public capital without losing control  dow jones   co   publisher of the wall street journal  had a similar structure and was controlled by the bancroft family but was later bought by news corporation in       which itself is controlled by rupert murdoch and his family through a similar dual class structure

   inch page width  was addressed by both executive editor bill keller and the new york times president scott heekin canedy in memos to the staff  keller defended the  more reader friendly  move indicating that in cutting out the  flabby or redundant prose in longer pieces  the reduction would make for a better paper  similarly  keller confronted the challenges of covering news with  less room  by proposing more  rigorous editing  and promised an ongoing commitment to  hard hitting  ground breaking journalism     the official change went into effect on august               the new york
