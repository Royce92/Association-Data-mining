 cloud computing has become a social phenomenon being used by most people everyday  as with every important social phenomenon there are issues that limit its widespread adoption     most issues start from the fact that the user loses control of his or her data  because it is stored on someone else s computer  the cloud provider   this happens when the owner of the remote servers is a person or organisation other than the user  as their interests may point in different directions  for example  the user may wish that his or her information is kept private  but the owner of the remote servers may want to take advantage of it for their own business     there are many issues relating to cloud computing  some of which are discussed here             critical voices including gnu project initiator richard stallman and oracle founder larry ellison warned that the whole concept is rife with privacy and ownership concerns and constitute merely a fad      however  cloud computing continues to gain steam  with     of the major european technology decision makers estimate that the cloud is a priority in      and       and the cloud budget may reach     of the overall it budget      according to the techinsights report       cloud succeeds based on a survey  the cloud implementations generally meets or exceeds expectations across major service models  such as infrastructure as a service  iaas   platform as a service  paas  and software as a service  saas       several deterrents to the widespread adoption of cloud computing remain  among them are reliability  availability of services and data  security  complexity  costs  regulations and legal issues  performance  migration  reversion  the lack of standards  limited customization and issues of privacy  the cloud offers many strong points  infrastructure flexibility  faster deployment of applications and data  cost control  adaptation of cloud resources to real needs  improved productivity  etc  the early     s cloud market is dominated by software and services in saas mode and iaas  infrastructure   especially the private cloud  paas and the public cloud are further back     the increased use of cloud computing services such as gmail and google docs has pressed the issue of privacy concerns of cloud computing services to the utmost importance   the provider of such services lie in a position such that with the greater use of cloud computing services has given access to a plethora of data   this access has the immense risk of data being disclosed either accidentally or deliberately   privacy advocates have criticized the cloud model for giving hosting companies  greater ease to control and thus  to monitor at will communication between host company and end user  and access user data  with or without permission   instances such as the secret nsa program  working with at t  and verizon  which recorded over    million telephone calls between american citizens  causes uncertainty among privacy advocates  and the greater powers it gives to telecommunication companies to monitor user activity    a cloud service provider  csp  can complicate data privacy because of the extent of virtualization  virtual machines  and cloud storage used to implement cloud service   csp operations  customer or tenant data may not remain on the same system  or in the same data center or even within the same provider s cloud  this can lead to legal concerns over jurisdiction  while there have been efforts  such as us eu safe harbor  to  harmonise  the legal environment  providers such as amazon still cater to major markets  typically to the united states and the european union  by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select  regions and availability zones    cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is on the cloud at any time  it could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information    this becomes a major concern as these service providers  who employ administrators which can leave room for potential unwanted disclosure of information on the cloud      many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order even without a warrant  that is permitted in their privacy policies which users have to agree to before they start using cloud services     there are life threatening situations in which there is no time to wait for the police to issue a warrant  many cloud providers can share information immediately to the police in such situations     the dropbox privacy policy states that       we may share information as discussed below      law   order  we may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to  a  comply with the law   b  protect any person from death or serious bodily injury   c  prevent fraud or abuse of dropbox or our users  or  d  protect dropbox s property rights     the sydney morning herald reported about the mosman bomb hoax  which was a life threatening situation  that        as to whether nsw police needed a warrant to access the information it was likely to have  byrne said it depended on the process taken   gmail does set out in their process in terms of their legal disclosure guidelines that it can be done by a search warrant     but there are exceptions that can apply in different parts of the world and different service providers  for example  facebook generally provides an exception for emergency life threatening situations that are signed off by law enforcement      another computer forensic expert at it ensics  which works for large corporations dealing with matters like internal fraud  scott lasak  said that police  would just contact google  and  being of a police or fbi background google would assist them       whether or not they need to go through warrants or that sort of thing i m not sure  but even for just an ip address they might not even need a warrant for something like that being of a police background            nsw police would not comment on whether it had received help from google  the search giant also declined to comment  instead offering a standard statement on how it cooperated with law enforcement     a spokesman for the online users  lobby group electronic frontiers australia  stephen collins  said google was likely to have handed over the need information on the basis of  probable cause or a warrant   which he said was  perfectly legitimate   he also said  it happens with relative frequency    such things are rarely used in australia for trivial or malevolent purposes      solutions to privacy in cloud computing include policy and legislation as well as end users  choices for how data is stored   the cloud service provider needs to establish clear and relevant policies that describe how the data of each cloud user will be accessed and used   cloud service users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access      to comply with regulations including fisma  hipaa  and sox in the united states  the data protection directive in the eu and the credit card industry s pci dss  users may have to adopt community or hybrid deployment modes that are typically more expensive and may offer restricted benefits  this is how google is able to  manage and meet additional government policy requirements beyond fisma      and rackspace cloud or qubespace are able to claim pci compliance       many providers also obtain a sas    type ii audit  but this has been criticised on the grounds that the hand picked set of goals and standards determined by the auditor and the auditee are often not disclosed and can vary widely    providers typically make this information available on request  under non disclosure agreement         customers in the eu contracting with cloud providers outside the eu eea have to adhere to the eu regulations on export of personal data       u s  federal agencies have been directed by the office of management and budget to use a process called fedramp  federal risk and authorization management program  to assess and authorize cloud products and services  federal cio steven vanroekel issued a memorandum to federal agency chief information officers on december         defining how federal agencies should use fedramp  fedramp consists of a subset of nist special publication        security controls specifically selected to provide protection in cloud environments  a subset has been defined for the fips     low categorization and the fips     moderate categorization  the fedramp program has also established a joint accreditation board  jab  consisting of chief information officers from dod  dhs  and gsa  the jab is responsible for establishing accreditation standards for  rd party organizations who perform the assessments of cloud solutions  the jab also reviews authorization packages  and may grant provisional authorization  to operate   the federal agency consuming the service still has final responsibility for final authority to operate       a multitude of laws and regulations have forced specific compliance requirements onto many companies that collect  generate or store data  these policies may dictate a wide array of data storage policies  such as how long information must be retained  the process used for deleting data  and even certain recovery plans  below are some examples of compliance laws or regulations     in a virtualized cloud computing environment  customers may never know exactly where their data is stored  in fact  data may be stored across multiple data centers in an effort to improve reliability  increase performance  and provide redundancies  this geographic dispersion may make it more difficult to ascertain legal jurisdiction if disputes arise       as with other changes in the landscape of computing  certain legal issues arise with cloud computing  including trademark infringement  security concerns and sharing of proprietary data resources     the electronic frontier foundation has criticized the united states government during the megaupload seizure process for considering that people lose property rights by storing data on a cloud computing service       one important but not often mentioned problem with cloud computing is the problem of who is in  possession  of the data  if a cloud company is the possessor of the data  the possessor has certain legal rights  if the cloud company is the  custodian  of the data  then a different set of rights would apply  the next problem in the legalities of cloud computing is the problem of legal ownership of the data  many terms of service agreements are silent on the question of ownership       these legal issues are not confined to the time period in which the cloud based application is actively being used  there must also be consideration for what happens when the provider customer relationship ends  in most cases  this event will be addressed before an application is deployed to the cloud  however  in the case of provider insolvencies or bankruptcy the state of the data may become blurred       because cloud computing is still relatively new  standards are still being developed    many cloud platforms and services are proprietary  meaning that they are built on the specific standards  tools and protocols developed by a particular vendor for its particular cloud offering    this can make migrating off a proprietary cloud platform prohibitively complicated and expensive       three types of vendor lock in can occur with cloud computing       heterogeneous cloud computing is described as a type of cloud environment that prevents vendor lock in  and aligns with enterprise data centers that are operating hybrid cloud models    the absence of vendor lock in lets cloud administrators select his or her choice of hypervisors for specific tasks  or to deploy virtualized infrastructures to other enterprises without the need to consider the flavor of hypervisor in the other enterprise       a heterogeneous cloud is considered one that includes on premise private clouds  public clouds and software as a service clouds  heterogeneous clouds can work with environments that are not virtualized  such as traditional data centers    heterogeneous clouds also allow for the use of piece parts  such as hypervisors  servers  and storage  from multiple vendors       cloud piece parts  such as cloud storage systems  offer apis but they are often incompatible with each other    the result is complicated migration between backends  and makes it difficult to integrate data spread across various locations    this has been described as a problem of vendor lock in    the solution to this is for clouds to adopt common standards       heterogeneous cloud computing differs from homogeneous clouds  which have been described as those using consistent building blocks supplied by a single vendor    intel general manager of high density computing  jason waxman  is quoted as saying that a homogeneous system of        servers would cost    million more in capital expenditure and use   megawatt of power       open source software has provided the foundation for many cloud computing implementations  prominent examples being the hadoop framework   and vmware s cloud foundry    in november       the free software foundation released the affero general public license  a version of gplv  intended to close a perceived legal loophole associated with free software designed to run over a network       most cloud providers expose apis that are typically well documented  often under a creative commons license    but also unique to their implementation and thus not interoperable  some vendors have adopted others  apis and there are a number of open standards under development  with a view to delivering interoperability and portability    as of november       the open standard with broadest industry support is probably openstack  founded in      by nasa and rackspace  and now governed by the openstack foundation    openstack supporters include amd  intel  canonical  suse linux  red hat  cisco  dell  hp  ibm  yahoo and now vmware       as cloud computing is achieving increased popularity  concerns are being voiced about the security issues introduced through adoption of this new model      the effectiveness and efficiency of traditional protection mechanisms are being reconsidered as the characteristics of this innovative deployment model can differ widely from those of traditional architectures    an alternative perspective on the topic of cloud security is that this is but another  although quite broad  case of  applied security  and that similar security principles that apply in shared multi user mainframe security models apply with cloud security       the relative security of cloud computing services is a contentious issue that may be delaying its adoption    physical control of the private cloud equipment is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else s control  physical control and the ability to visually inspect data links and access ports is required in order to ensure data links are not compromised  issues barring the adoption of cloud computing are due in large part to the private and public sectors  unease surrounding the external management of security based services  it is the very nature of cloud computing based services  private or public  that promote external management of provided services  this delivers great incentive to cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services    security issues have been categorised into sensitive data access  data segregation  privacy  bug exploitation  recovery  accountability  malicious insiders  management console security  account control  and multi tenancy issues  solutions to various cloud security issues vary  from cryptography  particularly public key infrastructure  pki   to use of multiple cloud providers  standardisation of apis  and improving virtual machine support and legal support           cloud computing offers many benefits  but is vulnerable to threats  as cloud computing uses increase  it is likely that more criminals find new ways to exploit system vulnerabilities  many underlying challenges and risks in cloud computing increase the threat of data compromise  to mitigate the threat  cloud computing stakeholders should invest heavily in risk assessment to ensure that the system encrypts to protect data  establishes trusted foundation to secure the platform and infrastructure  and builds higher assurance into auditing to strengthen compliance  security concerns must be addressed to maintain trust in cloud computing technology       data breach is a big concern in cloud computing  a compromised server could significantly harm the users as well as cloud providers  a variety of information could be stolen  these include credit card and social security numbers  addresses  and personal messages  the u s  now requires cloud providers to notify customers of breaches  once notified  customers now have to worry about identity theft and fraud  while providers have to deal with federal investigations  lawsuits and reputational damage  customer lawsuits and settlements have resulted in over    billion in losses to cloud providers       although cloud computing is often assumed to be a form of green computing  there is currently no way to measure how  green  computers are       the primary environmental problem associated with the cloud is energy use  phil radford of greenpeace said  we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old  polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today     greenpeace ranks the energy usage of the top ten big brands in cloud computing  and successfully urged several companies to switch to clean energy  on thursday  december           greenpeace and facebook announced together that facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations      soon thereafter  apple agreed to make all of its data centers  coal free  by the end of      and doubled the amount of solar energy powering its maiden  nc data center    following suit  salesforce agreed to shift to      clean energy by            citing the servers  effects on the environmental effects of cloud computing  in areas where climate favors natural cooling and renewable electricity is readily available  the environmental effects will be more moderate   the same holds true for  traditional  data centers   thus countries with favorable conditions  such as finland    sweden and switzerland    are trying to attract cloud computing data centers  energy efficiency in cloud computing can result from energy aware scheduling and server consolidation    however  in the case of distributed clouds over data centers with different sources of energy including renewable energy  the use of energy efficiency reduction could result in a significant carbon footprint reduction       as with privately purchased hardware  customers can purchase the services of cloud computing for nefarious purposes  this includes password cracking and launching attacks using the purchased services    in       a banking trojan illegally used the popular amazon service as a command and control channel that issued software updates and malicious instructions to pcs that were infected by the malware       the introduction of cloud computing requires an appropriate it governance model to ensure a secured computing environment and to comply with all relevant organizational information technology policies      as such  organizations need a set of capabilities that are essential when effectively implementing and managing cloud services  including demand management  relationship management  data security management  application lifecycle management  risk and compliance management    a danger lies with the explosion of companies joining the growth in cloud computing by becoming providers  however  many of the infrastructural and logistical concerns regarding the operation of cloud computing businesses are still unknown  this over saturation may have ramifications for the industry as a whole       the increased use of cloud computing could lead to a reduction in demand for high storage capacity consumer end devices  due to cheaper low storage devices that stream all content via the cloud becoming more popular citation needed in a wired article  jake gardner explains that while unregulated usage is beneficial for it and tech moguls like amazon  the anonymous nature of the cost of consumption of cloud usage makes it difficult for business to evaluate and incorporate it into their business plans       outside of the information technology and software industry  the term  cloud  can be found to reference a wide range of services  some of which fall under the category of cloud computing  while others do not  the cloud is often used to refer to a product or service that is discovered  accessed and paid for over the internet  but is not necessarily a computing resource  examples of service that are sometimes referred to as  the cloud  include  but are not limited to  crowd sourcing  cloud printing  crowd funding  cloud manufacturing         due to its multi tenant nature and resource sharing  cloud computing must also deal with the  noisy neighbor  effect  this effect in essence indicates that in a shared infrastructure  the activity of a virtual machine on a neighboring core on the same physical host may lead to increased performance degradation of the vms in the same physical host  due to issues such as e g  cache contamination  due to the fact that the neighboring vms may be activated or deactivated at arbitrary times  the result is an increased variation in the actual performance of cloud resources  this effect seems to be dependent on the nature of the applications that run inside the vms but also other factors such as scheduling parameters and the careful selection may lead to optimized assignment in order to minimize the phenomenon  this has also led to difficulties in comparing various cloud providers on cost and performance using traditional benchmarks for service and application performance  as the time period and location in which the benchmark is performed can result in widely varied results    this observation has led in turn to research efforts to make cloud computing applications intrinsically aware of changes in the infrastructure so that the application can automatically adapt to avoid failure       philosopher slavoj  i ek points out that  although cloud computing enhances content accessibility  this access is  increasingly grounded in the virtually monopolistic privatization of the cloud which provides this access   according to him  this access  necessarily mediated through a handful of companies  ensures a progressive privatization of global cyberspace   i ek criticizes the argument purported by supporters of cloud computing that this phenomenon is part of the  natural evolution  of the internet  sustaining that the quasi monopolies  set prices at will but also filter the software they provide to give its  universality  a particular twist depending on commercial and ideological interests
