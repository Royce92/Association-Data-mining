 firefox os   project name  boot to gecko  also known as b g   is a linux kernel based open source operating system for smartphones and tablet computers  and is set to be used on smart tvs   it is being developed by mozilla  the non profit organization best known for the firefox web browser     firefox os is designed to provide a complete    community based alternative system for mobile devices  using open standards and approaches such as html  applications  javascript  a robust privilege model  open web apis to communicate directly with cellphone hardware   and application marketplace  as such  it competes with commercially developed operating systems such as apple s ios  google s android  microsoft s windows phone  and jolla s sailfish os     firefox os was publicly demonstrated in february       on android compatible smartphones     in january       at ces       zte confirmed they would be shipping a smartphone with firefox os    and on july          telef nica launched the first commercial firefox os based phone  zte open  in spain     which was quickly followed by geeksphone s peak     as of december           firefox os phones are offered by    operators in    countries throughout the world       mozilla has also partnered with t mobile to make a firefox os reference phone dubbed  flame  which is designed for developers to contribute to firefox os and to test apps               on july           andreas gal  director of research at mozilla corporation  announced the  boot to gecko  project  b g  on the mozilla dev platform mailing list   the project proposal was to  pursue the goal of building a complete  standalone operating system for the open web  in order to  find the gaps that keep web developers from being able to build apps that are   in every way   the equals of native apps built for the iphone  android  and windows phone      the announcement identified these work areas  new web apis to expose device and os capabilities such as telephone and camera  a privilege model to safely expose these to web pages  applications to prove these capabilities  and low level code to boot on an android compatible device     this led to much blog coverage      according to ars technica   mozilla says that b g is motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the standards based open web has the potential to be a competitive alternative to the existing single vendor application development stacks offered by the dominant mobile operating systems        in       andreas gal expanded on mozilla s aims  he characterized the current set of mobile os systems as  walled gardens    and presented firefox os as more accessible   we use completely open standards and there s no proprietary software or technology involved     gal also said that because the software stack is entirely html   there are already a large number of established developers    this assumption is employed in mozilla s webapi    these are intended w c standards that attempt to bridge the capability gap that currently exists between native frameworks and web applications    the goal of these efforts is to enable developers to build applications using webapi which would then run in any standards compliant browser without the need to rewrite their application for each platform     in july       boot to gecko was rebranded as  firefox os     after mozilla s well known desktop browser  firefox  and screenshots began appearing in august            in september       analysts strategy analysts forecast that firefox os would account for    of the global smartphone market in        its first year of commercial availability       in february       mozilla announced plans for global commercial roll out of firefox os    mozilla announced at a press conference before the start of mobile world congress in barcelona that the first wave of firefox os devices will be available to consumers in brazil  colombia  hungary  mexico  montenegro  poland  serbia  spain and venezuela  mozilla has also announced that lg electronics  zte  huawei and tcl corporation have committed to making firefox os devices       in december       new features were added with the     release  including conference calling  silent sms authentication for mobile billing  improved push notifications  and three state setting for do not track       async pan and zoom  apz     included in version      should improve user interface responsiveness     work is currently being done to optimize firefox os to run a    xa mb platform with version    t    a    xa mb device is out   that seems to use that version but it may be unfinished     at mobile world congress       mozilla and telef nica announced that the spanish telecommunications provider intended to deliver  open web devices  in      based on html  and these apis    mozilla also announced support for the project from adobe and qualcomm  and that deutsche telekom s innovation labs will join the project    mozilla demonstrated a  sneak preview  of the software and apps running on samsung galaxy s ii phones  replacing their usual android operating system      in august       a nokia employee demonstrated the os running on a raspberry pi       firefox os is compatible with a number of devices  including otoro  pandaboard  emulator  arm and x     desktop  nexus s  nexus s  g  samsung galaxy s ii  galaxy nexus   and nexus       in december       mozilla rolled out another update and released firefox os simulator      which can be downloaded as an add on for firefox  the latest version of firefox os simulator  version      was released on july           and announced on july                mozilla s planned us    firefox smartphone displayed at mwc  is built by spreadtrum    mozilla has collaborated with four handset makers and five wireless carriers to provide five firefox powered smartphones in europe and latin america so far with cellphone launches being led by uk marketer john d  bernard  in india  mozilla planned a launching at     in partnership with intex   spice    but the price ended up being      converted from       rupees        the initial development work involves three major software layers       gonk consists of a linux kernel and user space hardware abstraction layer  hal   the kernel and several user space libraries are common open source projects  linux  libusb  bluez  etc  some other parts of the hal are shared with the android project  gps  camera  among others  gonk is basically an extremely simple linux distribution and is therefore from gecko s perspective  simply a porting target of gecko  there is a port of gecko to gonk  just like there is a port of gecko to os x  and a port of gecko to android  however  since the development team have full control over gonk  the developers can fully expose all the features and interfaces required for comprehensive mobile platforms such as gecko  but which aren t currently possible to access on other mobile oses  for example  using gonk  gecko can obtain direct access to the full telephony stack and display framebuffer  but doesn t have this access on any other os       gecko is the web browser engine of firefox os  gecko implements open standards for html  css  and javascript  gecko includes a networking stack  graphics stack  layout engine  virtual machine  for javascript   and porting layers       gaia is the user interface of firefox os and controls everything drawn to screen  gaia includes by default implementations of a lock screen  home screen  telephone dialer and contacts application  text messaging application  camera application and a gallery support  plus the classic phone apps  mail  calendar  calculator and marketplace  gaia is written entirely in html  css  and javascript  it interfaces with the operating system through open web apis  which are implemented by gecko  because it uses only standard web apis  it can work on other oses and other web browsers       some screenshots of firefox os         home screen    notification area    chris ziegler of the technology blog the verge wrote that firefox os will take app distribution to pre iphone era  requiring application developers to deal with multiple carriers and their app stores      at the mobile world congress  gary kovacs  the ceo of mozilla  said that the devices matter less than what they re able to run  apps make or break a mobile platform these days  not hardware  and the advantage is that users don t have to install an app to use it  mozilla is making the most of this with the search functionality built into firefox os  a core feature of the platform       janne lindqvist  a mobile security researcher at the rutgers university winlab  expressed concerns related to the discovery mechanism of a web based platform  but a mozilla spokesperson has stated that they are  requiring developers to package downloadable apps in a zip file that has been cryptographically signed by the store from which it originated  assuring that it has been reviewed   in addition   apps coming back from search are given only limited access to device programming interfaces and applications  unless the user grants permission for further access        the structural similarities between firefox os and android allow the mozilla platform to run on a number of devices that ship with android  while some ports of firefox os are hardly different from their original versions  others are heavily modified to fit the device in question  there are quite a few to note that are specifically made for firefox os as stated above  there are some that are designed for the developers themselves and others that are consumer phones  while to add to it there are also emulators for testing both apps and the os itself on the desktop which are designed for both os testing and the developers themselves     firefox os specific devices for developers     firefox os specific devices for consumers     firefox os has been ported to the following devices
