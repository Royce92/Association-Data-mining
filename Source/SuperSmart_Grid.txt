 the supersmart grid  ssg  is a hypothetical wide area electricity network connecting europe with northern africa  the middle east  turkey and the ips ups system of cis countries  the system would unify super grid and smart grid capabilities into a comprehensive network  there is no planned locations for infrastructure or schedule explicitly for the ssg  the name is used to discuss the economic and technological feasibility of such a network and ways that it might gain political support     the ambitious upgrade and unification of current transmission and or distribution grids finds support among advocates of large scale utilization of alternative energy  and as well as advocates of enhanced energy security for europe   the ssg proposal was initiated by the european climate forum and at the potsdam institute for climate impact research by antonella battaglini and colleagues             the concept of a  super grid  is not new  the term itself was used to describe the emerging unification of the great britain grid in the   s   europe has been unifying its grids since the     s and its largest unified grid is the synchronous grid of continental europe serving    countries  there are studies and ongoing discussions regarding creation of a synchronous grid spanning    time zones that would result from unifying the ucte grid with that of the ips ups interconnection serving russia  ukraine and other countries of the former soviet union   such mega systems are experiencing scaling problems as a result of network complexity  transmission congestion  and the need for rapid diagnostic  coordination and control systems   advocates of schemes such as the supersmart grid claim that such a major technological upgrade is necessary to assure the practical operation and promised benefits of such transcontinental mega grids     the concept of a wide area  super grid  with centralized control and the concept of small scale  local and decentralized smart grid are two approaches that are often perceived as being mutually exclusive alternatives  the ssg aims at reconciling the two approaches and considers them complementary and necessary to realize a transition towards a fully decarbonized electricity system  the super grid features would deliver inexpensive  high capacity  low loss transmission  interconnecting producers and consumers of electricity across vast distances  smart grid capabilities use the local grid s transmission and distribution network to coordinate distributed generation  grid storage and consumption into a cluster that appears to the super grid as a virtual power plant      the name supersmart grid was invented by antonella battaglini and used the first time in the position paper for the energy conference in lund in        in the context of the supersmart grid  advocates use the term  super grid  to refer to a network super imposed on top of local grid networks and should not be confused with the proper noun  supergrid  which refers to an undeveloped technology for combining hydrogen and electricity distribution     the ssg relies on existing technology  the supersmart grid would employ high voltage direct current  hvdc  cables in its first generation implementation to integrate the european electricity market and possibly connect it to neighboring regions  such as north africa  and their vast renewable energy resources  such as those that could be unlocked by the desertec   medgrid project  the supersmart grid would operate  on top  of the local high voltage ac  hvac  grids  existing ac grids would still transmit electricity over shorter domestic distances  but be upgraded to smart grids      dr gregor czisch of kassel university  has constructed and optimized a model indicating that an entirely renewable electric supply system is possible at today s electric  prices     an initial project proposed by irish wind farm developer airtricity  formerly eirtricity  and swiss engineering firm abb would provide a chain of undersea cable connections extending from the baltic sea southward to spain and servicing areas between the endpoints  proponents of the project claim that this western corridor could be in service as early as       the first segments would provide two      megawatt links connecting a new        megawatt group of wind parks in the north sea with consumers in the uk and continental europe
