 mac os is a series of graphical user interface based operating systems developed by apple inc  for their macintosh line of computer systems     the original operating system was first introduced in      as being integral to the original macintosh  and referred to as the  system   referred to by its major revision starting with  system   and  system     apple rebranded version     as  mac os  as part of their macintosh clone program in       the macintosh  specifically its system software  is credited with having popularized the early graphical user interface concept     macintosh operating systems have been released in two major series  up to major revision    from      to       it is historically known as classic mac os  major revision     from      to present  is branded os x  originally referred to as mac os x    major revisions to the macintosh os are now issued as point revisions  such that  for example       is substantially different from       both series share a general interface design  and there has been some overlap with shared application frameworks and virtual machine technology for compatibility  but the two series also have deeply different architectures             apple s original concept for the macintosh deliberately sought to minimize the user s conceptual awareness of the operating system  tasks which required more operating system knowledge on other systems would be accomplished by mouse gestures and graphic controls on a macintosh  this would differentiate it from then current systems  such as ms dos  which used a command line interface consisting of tersely abbreviated textual commands     the core of the system software was held in rom  with updates originally provided on floppy disk  freely copyable at apple dealers  the user s involvement in an upgrade of the operating system was also minimized to running an installer  or replacing system files using the file manager  this simplicity meant that the early releases lacked any access controls  in effect giving its single user root privileges at all times     early versions of mac os were compatible only with motorola       family macintoshes  as apple introduced computers with powerpc hardware  the os was ported to support this architecture  mac os     was the last version that could run on a    k  processor  the         os x  which has superseded the  classic  mac os  is compatible with only powerpc processors from version        cheetah   to version        panther    both powerpc and intel processors are supported in version        tiger   intel only supported after an update  and version        leopard         and later versions support only intel processors      the early macintosh operating system initially consisted of two pieces of software  called  system  and  finder   each with its own version number   system       was the first to include the mac os logo  a variation on the original happy mac startup icon   and mac os     was the first to be named  mac os      before the introduction of the later powerpc g  based systems  significant parts of the system were stored in physical rom on the motherboard  the initial purpose of this was to avoid using up the limited storage of floppy disks on system support  given that the early macs had no hard disk  only one model of mac was ever actually bootable using the rom alone  the      mac classic model   this architecture also allowed for a completely graphical os interface at the lowest levelclarify without the need for a text only console or command line mode  boot time errors  such as finding no functioning disk drives  were communicated to the user graphically  usually with an icon or the distinctive chicago bitmap font and a chime of death or a series of beeps  this was in contrast to computers of the time  which displayed such messages in a mono spaced font on a black background  and required the use of the keyboard  not a mouse  for input  to provide such niceties at a low level  mac os depended on core system software in rom on the motherboard  a fact also used to ensure that only apple computers or licensed clones  with the copyright protected roms from apple  could run mac os     the  classic  mac os is characterized by its monolithic system  versions of mac os up through system   only ran one application at a time  even so  it was noted for its ease of use  mac os gained cooperative multitasking with system    which ran on the mac se and macintosh ii  it was criticized for its very limited memory management  lack of protected memory  no access controls  and susceptibility to conflicts among operating system  extensions  that provide additional functionality  such as networking  or support for a particular device  some extensions didn t work properly together  or only worked when loaded in a particular order  troubleshooting mac os extensions could be a time consuming process of trial and error     the macintosh originally used the macintosh file system  mfs   a flat file system with only one level of folders  this was quickly replaced in      by the hierarchical file system  hfs   which had a true directory tree  both file systems are otherwise compatible     most file systems used with dos  unix  or other operating systems treat a file as simply a sequence of bytes  requiring an application to know which bytes represent what type of information  by contrast  mfs and hfs give files two different  forks   the data fork contains the same sort of information as other file systems  such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of an image file  the resource fork contains other structured data such as menu definitions  graphics  sounds  or code segments  a file might consist only of resources with an empty data fork  or only a data fork with no resource fork  a word processor file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork  so that an application which doesn t recognize the styling information can still read the raw text     on the other hand  these forks would provide a challenge to interoperability with other operating systems  how does one copy a dual forked file into a different file system  or across a file transfer system  or embed it into email  in copying or transferring a macos file to a non mac system  the default implementations would simply strip the file of its resource fork  most data files contained only nonessential information in their resource fork  such as window size and location  but program files would be inoperative without their resources  this necessitated such encoding schemes as binhex and macbinary  which allowed a user to encode a dual forked file into a single stream  or inversely take a single stream so encoded and reconstitute it into a dual forked file usable by macos     powerpc versions of os x up to and including os x v     tiger  support for classic was dropped by apple with v     leopard s release and it is no longer included  include a compatibility layer for running older mac applications  the classic environment  this runs a full copy of the older mac os  version     or later  in an os x process  powerpc based macs shipped with mac os     as well as os x  mac os     had to be installed by the user  it was not installed by default on hardware revisions released after the release of os x      tiger  most well written  classic  applications function properly under this environment  but compatibility is only assured if the software was written to be unaware of the actual hardware  and to interact solely with the operating system  the classic environment is not available on intel based macintosh systems due to the incompatibility of mac os   with the x   hardware     users of the classic mac os generally upgraded to os x  but many criticized it as being more difficult and less user friendly than the original mac os  for the lack of certain features that had not been re implemented in the new os  or for being slower on the same hardware  especially older hardware   or other  sometimes serious incompatibilities with the older os   because drivers  for printers  scanners  tablets  etc   written for the older mac os are not compatible with os x  and due to the lack of os x support for older apple machines  a significant number of macintosh users continued using the older classic mac os     in june       steve jobs announced at the worldwide developers conference keynote that apple computers would be transitioning from powerpc to intel processors and thus dropping compatibility on new machines for mac os classic  at the same conference  jobs announced developer transition kits that included beta versions of apple software including os x that developers could use to test their applications as they ported them to run on intel powered macs  in january       apple released the first macintosh computers with intel processors  an imac and the macbook pro  and in february       apple released a mac mini with an intel core solo and duo processor  on may           apple released the macbook  before completing the intel transition on august   with the mac pro  to ease the transition for early buyers of the new machines  intel based macs included an emulation technology called rosetta  which allows them to run os x software that was compiled for powerpc based macintosh models  rosetta runs transparently  creating a user experience identical to running the software on a powerpc machine  though execution is typically slower than with native code  rosetta was an optional installation in os x      snow leopard and is not available at all in os x      lion     os x  introduced as mac os x in      and renamed os x in       is the latest version of apple s operating system  although it is officially designated as simply  version     of the mac os  it has a history largely independent of the earlier mac os releases     the operating system is the successor to mac os   and the  classic  mac os  it is however a unix operating system  based on the nextstep operating system and the xnu kernel which apple acquired after purchasing next computer with its ceo steve jobs returning to apple at that time  os x also makes use of the bsd code   there have been    significant releases of os x  the most recent being os x        referred to as yosemite  prior to       came        mavericks           mountain lion           lion           snow leopard           leopard           tiger           panther           jaguar           puma    and        cheetah       os x also had six significant releases as os x server  the first of these  mac os x server      was released in beta before the client version in       the server versions are architecturally identical to the client versions  with the differentiation found in their inclusion of tools for server management  including tools for managing os x based workgroups  mail servers  and web servers  amongst other tools  as of the name change to os x  os x server is no longer sold as a separate operating system product  the server tools could then be added to the singular os x product  giving the same functionality     os x server is available as an operating system to order on mac mini and mac pro computers as a part of a server package  unlike the client version  os x server can be run in a virtual machine using emulation software such as parallels desktop and vmware fusion     os x was used as the basis for ios   originally iphone os  used on apple s iphone  ipod touch  ipad  and apple tv      star trek  as in  to boldly go where no mac has gone before   was a relatively unknown secret prototype apple started work on in       whose goal was to create a version of the classic mac os that would run on intel compatible x   personal computers  the project was instigated by novell  inc   who were looking to integrate their dr dos with the mac os ui as a retort to microsoft s windows      the apple novell team  four from apple  four from novell  was able to get the macintosh finder and some basic applications  like quicktime  running smoothly on the x   architecture  some of the code from this effort was reused later when porting the mac os to powerpc      the project was canceled only one year later in early       there are two theories for the project s short life  the first is that apple s board canceled further development upon realizing that going with star trek would mean an entirely new business model and one that would likely see a notable drop in apple s lucrative hardware sales  and the second is that an x   mac os was not commercially viable in the early nineties because microsoft s contracts for windows     forced pc manufacturers to pay a royalty to microsoft for every computer shipped  regardless of what operating system it contained   thus  widespread support for a new operating system with relatively few applications available was unlikely     a further complication was that star trek was designed to be source level compatible  not binary compatible  with the mac os  mac applications would therefore have to be recompiled or rewritten by their developers to run on the x   architecture  and there was much skepticism as to exactly how much work this would entail     fifteen years after star trek  support for the x   architecture was officially included in mac os  and then apple transitioned all desktop computers to the x   architecture  this was not the direct result of earlier project star trek efforts  the darwin underpinning used for os x      and later included support for the x   architecture  the remaining non darwin portion of os x  based on openstep  which ran on intel processors  was released officially with the introduction of x   macintosh computers  in fact  steve jobs said that mac os x was  leading a secret double life  during the introduction of the x   transition     although the star trek software was never released  third party macintosh emulators  such as vmac  basilisk ii  and executor  eventually made it possible to run the classic mac os on intel based pcs  these emulators were restricted to emulating the       series of processors  and as such most couldn t run versions of the mac os that succeeded      which required powerpc processors  most also required a mac rom image or a hardware interface supporting a real mac rom chip  those requiring an image are of dubious legal standing as the rom image may infringe on apple s intellectual property     a notable exception was the executor commercial software product from abacus research   development  the only product that used      reverse engineered code without the use of apple technology  it ran extremely quickly but never achieved more than a minor subset of functionality  few programs were completely compatible and many were extremely crash prone if they ran at all  executor filled a niche market for porting       classic mac applications to x   platforms  development ceased in      and the source code was released by the author in late            emulators using mac rom images offered near complete mac os compatibility and later versions offered excellent performance as modern x   processor performance increased exponentially     most of the mac user base had already started moving to the powerpc platform that offered backward compatibility on   xx     xx operating systems along with faster powerpc software support  this helped ease the transition to powerpc only applications while prematurely obsolescing       emulators and the classic only applications they supported well before these emulators were refined enough to compete with a real mac     at the time of       emulator development  powerpc support was difficult to justify not only due to the emulation code itself but also the anticipated wide performance overhead of an emulated powerpc architecture vs  a real powerpc based mac  this would later prove correct with the start of the pearpc and project even years later despite the availability of  th    th generation x   processors employing similar architecture paradigms present in the powerpc citation needed many application developers were also creating and releasing both       classic and powerpc versions concurrently helping to negate the need for powerpc emulation  powerpc mac users who could technically run either obviously chose the faster powerpc applications  soon apple was no longer selling       based macs and the existing installed base started to quickly evaporate  despite the eventual excellent       emulation technology available they proved never to be even a minor threat to real macs due to their late arrival and immaturity even several years after the release of much more compelling powerpc based macs     the pearpc emulator is capable of emulating the powerpc processors required by newer versions of the mac os  like os x   unfortunately  it is still in the early stages and  like many emulators  tends to run much slower than a native operating system would     during the transition from powerpc to intel processors  apple realized the need to incorporate a powerpc emulator into os x in order to protect its customers  investments in software designed to run on the powerpc  apple s solution is an emulator called rosetta  prior to the announcement of rosetta  industry observers assumed that any powerpc emulator running on an x   processor would suffer a heavy performance penalty  e g   pearpc s slow performance   rosetta s relatively minor performance penalty therefore took many by surprise     another powerpc emulator is sheepshaver  which has been around since      for beos on the powerpc platform  but in      was open sourced with porting efforts beginning to get it to run on other platforms  originally it was not designed for use on x   platforms and required an actual powerpc processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor  although it provides powerpc processor support  it can only run up to mac os       because it does not emulate a memory management unit     other examples include shapeshifter  by the same programmer that conceived sheepshaver   fusion and ifusion  the latter ran classic mac os with a powerpc  coprocessor  accelerator card  using this method has been said to equal or better the speed of a macintosh with the same processor  especially with respect to the m  k series due to real macs running in mmu trap mode  hampering performance     several computer manufacturers over the years have made macintosh clones capable of running mac os  notably power computing  umax and motorola  these machines normally ran various versions of classic mac os  steve jobs ended the clone licensing program after returning to apple in          in       a manufacturing company in miami  florida called psystar corporation announced a      clone that comes with a barebones system that can run mac os x      leopard  threatened with legal battles  psystar originally called the system openmac and have since changed it to open computer  apple filed a lawsuit with the company and asked that psystar be ordered to stop producing clone systems  recall every system sold  and pay monetary damages    eventually  apple prevailed in court  and the open computer s production was ceased  psystar itself appears to be defunct now  as the company s website is gone     in       apple released its first unix based os  a ux  which was a unix operating system with the mac os look and feel  it was not very competitive for its time  due in part to the crowded unix market and macintosh hardware lacking high end design features present on workstation class computers  a ux had most of its success in sales to the u s  government  where posix compliance was a requirement that mac os could not meet     the macintosh application environment  mae  was a software package introduced by apple computer in      which allowed users of certain unix based computer workstations to run apple macintosh application software     mae used the x window system to emulate a macintosh finder style graphical user interface  the last version  mae      was compatible with system           mae was available for sun microsystems sparcstation and hewlett packard systems  it was discontinued on may              announced at the      world wide developers conference  wwdc   mklinux is an open source computer operating system started by the osf research institute and apple computer in february      to port linux to the powerpc platform  and thus macintosh computers  in the summer of       the community led mklinux developers association took over development of the operating system  mklinux is short for  microkernel linux   which refers to the project s adaptation of the linux kernel to run as a server hosted atop the mach microkernel  mklinux is based on version     of mach     although a violation of apple s eula    running os x operating systems compiled for x   or x  _     intel      on a non apple pc is possible using several approaches  if the processor is an intel core   or later  but not an intel atom  apple s standard mach_kernel is sufficient citation needed if the processor is an atom  the user supported  legacy  mach_kernel_atom  derived from the appropriate mach_kernel  is required citation needed if the processor is a pre core   intel  e g   a late pentium   either with or without em  t  but usually with h t  the user supported  legacy  mach_kernel_non atom  derived from the appropriate mach_kernel  is required citation needed    installation of mac os x requires a mac os x installer emulator  the most straightforward of which is a usb flash drive type installer emulator  once the installation has been successfully completed to the hard drive  the hard drive may be booted using the emulator portion of the usb flash drive as a  helper  and a boot loader installer may be downloaded and used to place the boot loader on the hard drive s boot blocks  thereafter  mac os x may be booted from the hard drive alone  the installed boot loader takes care of any required device injection and or kernel patching     mac os x is generally compatible with any intel desktop based system or intel based motherboard  ich  or later    however compatibility past snow leopard cannot be assured with ich   compatibility with ich  and with lion and      g mch has already been demonstrated and proven  compatibility with ich  or later and any associated mch  g mch is quite good  certainly including lion  and possibly also including mountain lion     mac os x compatibility with intel laptop  or netbook based systems is quite variable but has been successful on a few intel atom based netbooks
