 interest is a fee paid by a borrower of assets to the owner as a form of compensation for the use of the assets  it is most commonly the price paid for the use of borrowed money   or money earned by deposited funds      when money is borrowed  interest is typically paid to the lender as a percentage of the principal  the amount owed to the lender  the percentage of the principal that is paid as a fee over a certain period of time  typically one month or year  is called the interest rate  a bank deposit will earn interest because the bank is paying for the use of the deposited funds  assets that are sometimes lent with interest include money  shares  consumer goods through hire purchase  major assets such as aircraft  and even entire factories in finance lease arrangements  the interest is calculated upon the value of the assets in the same manner as upon money     interest is compensation to the lender  for a  risk of principal loss  called credit risk  and b  forgoing other investments that could have been made with the loaned asset  these forgone investments are known as the opportunity cost  instead of the lender using the assets directly  they are advanced to the borrower  the borrower then enjoys the benefit of using the assets ahead of the effort required to pay for them  while the lender enjoys the benefit of the fee paid by the borrower for the privilege  in economics  interest is considered the price of credit     interest is often compounded  which means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal  the total amount of debt grows exponentially  most notably when compounded at infinitesimally small intervals  and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e   however  in practice  interest is most often calculated on a daily  monthly  or yearly basis  and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate             according to historian paul johnson  the lending of  food money  was commonplace in middle east civilizations as far back as      bc  they regarded interest as legitimate since acquired seeds and animals could  reproduce themselves   whilst the ancient jewish religious prohibitions against usury      neshekh  were a  different view    on this basis  the laws of eshnunna  early  nd millennium bc  instituted a legal interest rate  specifically on deposits of dowry  since the silver being used in exchange for livestock or grain could not multiply of its own     the first council of nicaea  in      forbade clergy from engaging in usury  which was defined as lending on interest above   percent per month        apr   later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity    catholic church opposition to interest hardened in the era of scholastics  when even defending it was considered a heresy  st  thomas aquinas  the leading theologian of the catholic church  argued that the charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to  double charging   charging for both the thing and the use of the thing     in the medieval economy  loans were entirely a consequence of necessity  bad harvests  fire in a workplace  and  under those conditions  it was considered morally reproachable to charge interest citation needed it was also considered morally dubious  since no goods were produced through the lending of money  and thus it should not be compensated  unlike other activities with direct physical output such as blacksmithing or farming   for the same reason  interest has often been looked down upon in islamic civilization  with most scholars agreeing that the qur an explicitly forbids charging interest     medieval jurists developed several financial instruments to encourage responsible lending and circumvent prohibitions on usury  such as the contractum trinius     in the renaissance era  greater mobility of people facilitated an increase in commerce and the appearance of appropriate conditions for entrepreneurs to start new  lucrative businesses  given that borrowed money was no longer strictly for consumption but for production as well  interest was no longer viewed in the same manner  the school of salamanca elaborated on various reasons that justified the charging of interest  the person who received a loan benefited  and one could consider interest as a premium paid for the risk taken by the loaning party     there was also the question of opportunity cost  in that the loaning party lost other possibilities of using the loaned money  finally and perhaps most originally was the consideration of money itself as merchandise  and the use of one s money as something for which one should receive a benefit in the form of interest  mart n de azpilcueta also considered the effect of time  other things being equal  one would prefer to receive a given good now rather than in the future  this preference indicates greater value  interest  under this theory  is the payment for the time the loaning individual is deprived of the money     economically  the interest rate is the cost of capital and is subject to the laws of supply and demand of the money supply  the first attempt to control interest rates through manipulation of the money supply was made by the french central bank in          the first formal studies of interest rates and their impact on society were conducted by adam smith  jeremy bentham and mirabeau during the birth of classic economic thought citation needed in the late   th century leading swedish economist knut wicksell in his      interest and prices elaborated a comprehensive theory of economic crises based upon a distinction between natural and nominal interest rates  in the early   th century  irving fisher made a major breakthrough in the economic analysis of interest rates by distinguishing nominal interest from real interest  several perspectives on the nature and impact of interest rates have arisen since then     the latter half of the   th century saw the rise of interest free islamic banking and finance  a movement that attempts to apply religious law developed in the medieval period to the modern economy  some entire countries  including iran  sudan  and pakistan  have taken steps to eradicate interest from their financial systems altogether citation needed rather than charging interest  the interest free lender shares the risk by investing as a partner in profit loss sharing scheme  because predetermined loan repayment as interest is prohibited  as well as making money out of money is unacceptable  all financial transactions must be asset backed and it does not charge any  fee  for the service of lending     simple interest is calculated only on the principle amount  or on that portion of the principal amount that remains     the amount of simple interest is calculated according to the following formula     where r is the period interest rate  i m   b  the initial balance and mt the number of time periods elapsed     to calculate the period interest rate r  one divides the interest rate i by the number of periods mt     for example  imagine that a credit card holder has an outstanding balance of       and that the simple interest rate is        per annum  the interest added at the end of   months would be     and they would have to pay          to pay off the balance at this point     if instead they make interest only payments for each of those   months at the period rate r  the amount of interest paid would be     their balance at the end of   months would still be           in this case  the time value of money is not factored in  the steady payments have an additional cost that needs to be considered when comparing loans  for example  given a      principal     there are two complications involved when comparing different simple interest bearing offers     a bank account that offers only simple interest  that money can freely be withdrawn from is unlikely  since withdrawing money and immediately depositing it again would be advantageous     in economics  interest is considered the price of credit  therefore  it is also subject to distortions due to inflation  the nominal interest rate  which refers to the price before adjustment to inflation  is the one visible to the consumer  i e   the interest tagged in a loan contract  credit card statement  etc    nominal interest is composed of the real interest rate plus inflation  among other factors  a simple formula for the nominal interest is     where i is the nominal interest  r is the real interest and   is inflation     this formula attempts to measure the value of the interest in units of stable purchasing power  however  if this statement were true  it would imply at least two misconceptions  first  that all interest rates within an area that shares the same inflation  that is  the same country  should be the same  second  that the lenders know the inflation for the period of time that they are going to lend the money     one reason behind the difference between the interest that yields a treasury bond and the interest that yields a mortgage loan is the risk that the lender takes from lending money to an economic agent  in this particular case  a government is more likely to pay than a private citizen  therefore  the interest rate charged to a private citizen is larger than the rate charged to the government     to take into account the information asymmetry aforementioned  both the value of inflation and the real price of money are changed to their expected values resulting in the following equation     here  it is the nominal interest at the time of the loan  r t    is the real interest expected over the period of the loan    t    is the inflation expected over the period of the loan and  is the representative value for the risk engaged in the operation     the calculation for cumulative interest is  fv pv xa  xa    it ignores the  per year  convention and assumes compounding at every payment date  it is usually used to compare two long term opportunities citation needed    exceptions     flat rate loans and the rule of    s  some consumer loans have been structured as flat rate loans  with the loan outstanding determined by allocating the total interest across the term of the loan by using the  rule of   s  or  sum of digits  method  seventy eight is the sum of the numbers   through     inclusive  the practice enabled quick calculations of interest in the pre computer days  in a loan with interest calculated per the rule of   s  the total interest over the life of the loan is calculated as either simple or compound interest and amounts to the same as either of the above methods  payments remain constant over the life of the loan  however  payments are allocated to interest in progressively smaller amounts  in a one year loan  in the first month        of all interest owed over the life of the loan is due  in the second month         progressing to the twelfth month where only      of all interest is due  the practical effect of the rule of   s is to make early pay offs of term loans more expensive  for a one year loan  approximately     of all interest due is collected by the sixth month  and pay off of the principal then will cause the effective interest rate to be much higher than the apy used to calculate the payments       in       the united states outlawed the use of  rule of   s  interest in connection with mortgage refinancing and other consumer loans over five years in term   certain other jurisdictions have outlawed application of the rule of   s in certain types of loans  particularly consumer loans      rule of     the  rule of     is a  quick and dirty  method for finding out how fast money doubles for a given interest rate  for example  if you have an interest rate of     it will take      or    years for your money to double  compounding at     this is an approximation that starts to break down above         there are markets for investments  which include the money market  bond market  as well as retail financial institutions like banks  set interest rates  each specific debt takes into account the following factors in determining its interest rate     opportunity cost encompasses any other use to which the money could be put  including lending to others  investing elsewhere  holding cash  for safety  for example   and simply spending the funds     since the lender is deferring consumption  they will wish  as a bare minimum  to recover enough to pay the increased cost of goods due to inflation  because future inflation is unknown  there are three ways this might be achieved     however interest rates are set by the market  and it happens frequently that they are insufficient to compensate for inflation  for example at times of high inflation during e g  the oil crisis  and currently        when real yields on many inflation linked government stocks are negative     there is always the risk the borrower will become bankrupt  abscond or otherwise default on the loan  the risk premium attempts to measure the integrity of the borrower  the risk of his enterprise succeeding and the security of any collateral pledged  for example  loans to developing countries have higher risk premiums than those to the us government due to the difference in creditworthiness  an operating line of credit to a business will have a higher rate than a mortgage loan     the creditworthiness of businesses is measured by bond rating services and individual s credit scores by credit bureaus  the risks of an individual debt may have a large standard deviation of possibilities  the lender may want to cover his maximum risk  but lenders with portfolios of debt can lower the risk premium to cover just the most probable outcome     default interest is the rate of interest that a borrower must pay thenceforth in the event of material breach of the loan covenants     the default interest is usually much higher than the original interest rate since it is reflecting the aggravation in the financial risk of the borrower  default interest compensates the lender for the added risk     from the borrower s perspective  this means failure to make their regular payment for one or two payment periods or failure to pay taxes or insurance premiums for the loan collateral will lead to substantially higher interest for the entire remaining term of the loan     banks tend to add default interest to the loan agreements in order to separate between different scenarios     in some jurisdictions  default interest clauses are unenforceable as against public policy     charging interest equal only to inflation will leave the lender with the same purchasing power  but they would prefer their own consumption sooner rather than later  there will be an interest premium of the delay  they may not want to consume  but instead would invest in another product  the possible return they could realize in competing investments will determine what interest they charge     shorter terms often have less risk of default and exposure to inflation because the near future is easier to predict  in these circumstances  short term interest rates are lower than longer term interest rates  an upward sloping yield curve      interest rates are generally determined by the market  but government intervention   usually by a central bank   may strongly influence short term interest rates  and is one of the main tools of monetary policy  the central bank offers to borrow  or lend  large quantities of money at a rate which they determine  sometimes this is money that they have created ex nihilo  i e  printed  which has a major influence on supply and demand and hence on market interest rates     the federal reserve  fed  implements monetary policy largely by targeting the federal funds rate  this is the rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds  federal funds are the reserves held by banks at the fed     open market operations are one tool within monetary policy implemented by the federal reserve to steer short term interest rates  using the power to buy and sell treasury securities  the open market desk at the federal reserve bank of new york can supply the market with dollars by purchasing u s  treasury notes  hence increasing the nation s money supply  by increasing the money supply or aggregate supply of funding  asf   interest rates will fall due to the excess of dollars banks will end up with in their reserves  excess reserves may be lent in the fed funds market to other banks  thus driving down rates     it is increasingly recognized that during the business cycle  interest rates and credit risk are tightly interrelated  the jarrow turnbull model was the first model of credit risk that explicitly had random interest rates at its core  lando         darrell duffie and singleton         and van deventer and imai        discuss interest rates when the issuer of the interest bearing instrument can default     loans and bonds have some of the characteristics of money and are included in the broad money supply     national governments  provided  of course  that the country has retained its own currency  can influence interest rates and thus the supply and demand for such loans  thus altering the total of loans and bonds issued  generally speaking  a higher real interest rate reduces the broad money supply     through the quantity theory of money  increases in the money supply lead to inflation  this means that interest rates can affect inflation in the future citation needed    it is thought that jacob bernoulli discovered the mathematical constant e by studying a question about compound interest    he realized that if an account that starts with       and pays say      interest per year  at the end of the year  the value is        but if the interest is computed and added twice in the year  the    is multiplied by     twice  yielding           xa  xa        compounding quarterly yields            xa  xa           and so on     bernoulli noticed that if the frequency of compounding is increased without limit  this sequence can be modeled as follows     where n is the number of times the interest is to be compounded in a year     the balance of a loan with regular monthly payments is augmented by the monthly interest charge and decreased by the payment so    where    by repeated substitution one obtains expressions for bk  which are linearly proportional to b  and p and use of the formula for the partial sum of a geometric series results in    a solution of this expression for p in terms of b  and bn reduces to    to find the payment if the loan is to be finished in n payments one setsxa bnxa  xa       the pmt function found in spreadsheet programs can be used to calculate the monthly payment of a loan     an interest only payment on the current balance would be    the total interest  it  paid on the loan is    the formulas for a regular savings program are similar but the payments are added to the balances instead of being subtracted and the formula for the payment is the negative of the one above  these formulas are only approximate since actual loan balances are affected by rounding  to avoid an underpayment at the end of the loan  the payment must be rounded up to the next cent     consider a similar loan but with a new period equal to k periods of the problem above  if rk and pk are the new rate and payment  we now have    comparing this with the expression for bk above we note that    and    the last equation allows us to define a constant that is the same for both problems     and bk can be written as    solving for rk we find a formula for rk involving known quantities and bk  the balance after k periods     since b  could be any balance in the loan  the formula works for any two balances separate by k periods and can be used to compute a value for the annual interest rate     b  is a scale invariant since it does not change with changes in the length of the period     rearranging the equation for b  one gets a transformation coefficient  scale factor      and we see that r and p transform in the same manner     the change in the balance transforms likewise     which gives an insight into the meaning of some of the coefficients found in the formulas above  the annual rate  r    assumes only one payment per year and is not an  effective  rate for monthly payments  with monthly payments the monthly interest is paid out of each payment and so should not be compounded and an annual rate of    r would make more sense  if one just made interest only payments the amount paid for the year would be    r b      substituting pk   rk b  into the equation for the bk we get     since bn     we can solve for b      substituting back into the formula for the bk shows that they are a linear function of the rk and therefore the  k     this is the easiest way of estimating the balances if the  k are known  substituting into the first formula for bk above and solving for  k   we get        and  n can be found using the formula for  k above or computing the  k recursively from        to  n     since pxa  xa rb  the formula for the payment reduces to     and the average interest rate over the period of the loan is    which is less than r ifxa nxa  xa
