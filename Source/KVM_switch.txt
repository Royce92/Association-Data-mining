 a kvm switch  with kvm being an abbreviation for  keyboard  video and mouse   is a hardware device that allows a user to control multiple computers from one or more  sets of keyboards  video monitors and mouse  although multiple computers are connected to the kvm  typically a smaller number of computers can be controlled at any given time  modern devices have also added the ability to share other peripherals like usb devices and audio             before the mouse became relevant in server switching applications  the term keyboard video switch  kvs  was used to describe keyboard and monitor switching devices   with the increased adoption of microsoft windows  the mouse and other i o ports in peripheral switching became prevalent  remigius shatas  the founder of cybex  a popular peripheral switch manufacturer at that time  expanded the initialism to keyboard  video and mouse  kvm  in       at the same time  universal serial bus  usb  began to become the new industry standard for connecting computer peripherals     as a result of the growing need to switch peripherals  such as touchscreens  in addition to the keyboard  mouse and monitor  some companies are now selling  kvmp  switch devices  standing for keyboard  video  mouse and peripheral      with the popularity of usb usb keyboards  mice  and i o devices are still the most common devices connected to a kvm switch  the classes of kvm switches that are reviewed  are based on different types of core technologies in terms of how the kvm switch handles usb i o devices including keyboards  mice  touchscreen displays  etc   usb hid  usb human interface device     limited  supported  but does not allow usb re enumeration  which not only causes long delays in switching  but also sometimes causes hpd  hot plug device  errors to the os system s      yes  latency time within   second while switching between channels ports     kvm switches are useful where there are multiple computers  but no need for a dedicated keyboard  monitor and mouse for each one  they are frequently used in datacenters where multiple servers are placed in a single rack with a single keyboard  monitor and mouse  a kvm switch then allows data center personnel to connect to any server in the rack  a common example of home use is to enable the use of the full size keyboard  mouse and monitor of the home pc with a portable device such as a laptop  tablet pc or pda  or a computer using a different operating system     kvm switches offer different methods of connecting the computers  depending on the product  the switch may present native connectors on the device where standard keyboard  monitor and mouse cables can be attached  another method to have a single db   or similar connector that aggregated connections at the switch with three independent keyboard  monitor and mouse cables to the computers  subsequently  these were replaced by a special kvm cable which combined the keyboard  video and mouse cables in a single wrapped extension cable  the advantage of the last approach is in the reduction of the number of cables between the kvm switch and connected computers  the disadvantage is the cost of these cables     the method of switching from one computer to another depends on the switch  the original peripheral switches  rose  circa       used a rotary switch while active electronic switches  cybex  circa       used push buttons on the kvm device  in both cases  the kvm aligns operation between different computers and the users  keyboard  monitor and mouse  user console      in            cybex

keys   hot key switching is often complemented with an on screen display system that displays a list of connected computers     kvm switches differ in the number of computers that can be connected  traditional switching configurations range from   to    possible computers attached to a single device  enterprise grade devices interconnected via daisy chained and or cascaded methods can support a total of     computers equally accessed by any given user console      multi way channel selection can be found with new generation of kvm switches   via built in ir remote sensor control   via built in rs     port for serial commands and control   via on mouse click switch   fast switch using some function buttons for system selection   via touchscreen sensing control    while hdmi and dvi switches have been manufactured  vga is still the most common video connector found with kvm switches  although many switches are now compatible with dvi connectors  analog switches can be built with varying capacities for video bandwidth  affecting the unit s overall cost and quality  a typical consumer grade switch provides up to    xa mhz bandwidth  allowing for high definition resolutions at   xa hz     for analog video  resolution and refresh rate are the primary factors in determining the amount of bandwidth needed for the signal  the method of converting these factors into bandwidth requirements is a point of ambiguity  in part because it is dependent on the analog nature and state of the hardware  the same piece of equipment may require more bandwidth as it ages due to increased degradation of the source signal  most conversion formulas attempt to approximate the amount of bandwidth needed  including a margin of safety  as a rule of thumb  switch circuitry should provide up to three times the bandwidth required by the original signal specification  as this allows most instances of signal loss to be contained outside the range of the signal that is pertinent to picture quality     as crt based displays are dependent on refresh rate to prevent flickering  they generally require more bandwidth than comparable flat panel displays     a monitor uses ddc and edid  transmitted through specific pins  to identify itself to the system  kvm switches may have different ways of handling these data transmissions     microsoft guidelines recommend that kvm switches pass unaltered any i c traffic between the monitor and the pc hosts  and do not generate hpd events upon switching to a different port while maintaining stable non noise signal on inactive ports       kvm switches were originally passive  mechanical devices based on multi pole switches and some of the cheapest devices on the market still use this technology  mechanical switches usually have a rotary knob to select between computers  kvms typically allow sharing of two or four computers  with a practical limit of about twelve machines imposed by limitations on available switch configurations  modern hardware designs use active electronics rather than physical switch contacts with the potential to control many computers on a common system backbone     one limitation of mechanical kvm switches is that any computer not currently selected by the kvm switch does not  see  a keyboard or mouse connected to it  in normal operation this is not a problem  but while the machine is booting up it will attempt to detect its keyboard and mouse and either fail to boot or boot with an unwanted  e g  mouseless  configuration  likewise  a failure to detect the monitor may result in the computer falling back to    x    resolution  thus  mechanical kvm switches may be unsuitable for controlling machines which can reboot automatically  e g  after a power failure      another problem encountered with mechanical devices is the failure of one or more switch contacts to make firm  low resistance electrical connections  often necessitating some wiggling or adjustment of the knob to correct patchy colors on screen or unreliable peripheral response  gold plated contacts improve that aspect of switch performance  but add cost to the device     most active  electronic rather than mechanical  kvm devices provide peripheral emulation  sending signals to the computers that are not currently selected to simulate a keyboard  mouse and monitor being connected  these are used to control machines which may reboot in unattended operation  peripheral emulation services embedded in the hardware also provides continuous support where computers require constant communication with the peripherals     some types of active kvm switches do not emit signals that exactly match the physical keyboard  monitor  and mouse  which can result in unwanted behavior of the controlled machines  for example  the user of a multimedia keyboard connected to a kvm switch may find that the keyboard s multimedia keys have no effect on the controlled computers     there are software alternatives to some of the functionality of a hardware kvm switch  such as synergy  which does the switching in software and forwards input over standard network connections  this has the advantage of reducing the number of wires needed  screen edge switching allows the mouse to function over both monitors of two computers     stardock has also produced a similar software named multiplicity  now sold as an independent product from edgerunner     there are two types of remote kvm devices that are best described as local remote and kvm over ip     local remote kvm device design allows users to control computer equipment up to       feet     xa m  away from the user consoles  keyboard  monitor and mouse   they include support for standard category   cabling between computers and users interconnected by the switch device  in contrast  usb powered kvm devices are able to control computer equipment using a combination of usb  keyboard  mouse and monitor cables of up to   metres    xa ft       kvm over ip devices use a dedicated micro controller and potentially specialized video capture hardware to capture the video  keyboard  and mouse signals  compress and convert them into packets  and send them over an ethernet link to a remote console application that unpacks and reconstitutes the dynamic graphical image  this kvm over ip subsystem is typically connected to a system s standby power plane so that it s available during the entire bios boot process  these devices allow multiple computers to be controlled remotely across a wide area network  local area network or telephone line using the tcp ip protocol  there are performance issues related with lan wan hardware  standard protocols and network latency so user management is commonly referred to as  near real time      access to most remote or  kvm  over ip devices today use a web browser but can even switch between two or more hard drives  although many of the stand alone viewer software applications provided by many manufacturers are also reliant on activex or java     security note  some kvm chipsets or manufacturers require the  whitelisting  or authority to connect to be implicitly enabled  without the whitelist addition  the device will not work  this is by design and required to connect non standard usb devices to kvm s  this is completed by noting the device id s  usually copied from the device manager in windows   or documentation from the manufacturer of the usb device     generally all hid or consumer grade usb peripherals are exempt  but more exotic devices like tablets  or digitisers or usb toggles require manual addition to the white list table of the kvm     in comparison to conventional methods of remote administration  for example in band virtual network computing or terminal services   a kvm switch has the advantage that it doesn t depend on a software component running on the remote computer  thus allowing remote interaction with base level bios settings and monitoring of the entire booting process before  during  and after the operating system loads  modern kvm over ip appliances or switches typically use at least     bit data encryption securing the kvm configuration over a wan or lan  using ssl      kvm over ip devices can be implemented in different ways  with regards to video  pci kvm over ip cards use a form of screen scraping where the pci bus master kvm over ip card would access and copy out the screen directly from the graphics memory buffer  and as a result it must know which graphics chip it is working with  and what graphics mode this chip is currently in so that the contents of the buffer can be interpreted correctly as picture data  newer techniques in opma management subsystem cards and other implementations get the video data directly using the dvi bus  implementations can emulate either ps   or usb based keyboards and mice  an embedded vnc server is typically used for the video protocol in ipmi and intel amt implementations     kvm sharing devices function in reverse compared to kvm switches  that is  a single pc can be connected to multiple monitors  keyboards  and mice  while not as common  this configuration is useful when the operator wants to access a single computer from two or more  usually close  locations   for example  a public kiosk machine that also has a staff maintenance interface behind the counter  or a home office computer that doubles as a home theater pc
