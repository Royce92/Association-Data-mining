 file sharing is the practice of distributing or providing access to digital media  such as computer programs  multimedia  audio  images and video   documents or electronic books  file sharing may be achieved in a number of ways  common methods of storage  transmission and dispersion include manual sharing utilizing removable media  centralized servers on computer networks  world wide web based hyperlinked documents  and the use of distributed peer to peer networking             peer to peer file sharing allows users to use software that connects in to a peer to peer  p p  network to search for shared files on the computers of other users connected to the network  files of interest can then be shared by downloading directly from other users on the network  typically  large files are broken down into smaller chunks  which may be obtained from multiple peers and then reassembled by the downloader  this is done while the peer is simultaneously uploading the chunks it already has to other peers  p p technology was used by popular services like napster and spotify and is currently used by infinit  which has developed its own version of the technology   and bittorrent which is the most popular peer to peer network products     cloud based file syncing and sharing services allow users to create special folders on each of their computers or mobile devices  which the service then synchronizes so that it appears to be the same folder regardless of which computer is used to view it  files placed in this folder also are typically accessible through a website and mobile app  and can be easily shared with other users for viewing or collaboration  such services have become popular via consumer products such as dropbox and google drive     rsync is a more traditional program released in      which synchronizes files on a direct machine to machine basis     data synchronization in general can use other approaches to share files  such as distributed filesystems  version control  or mirrors     files were first exchanged on removable media  computers were able to access remote files using filesystem mounting  bulletin board systems         usenet         and ftp servers         internet relay chat        and hotline        enabled users to communicate remotely through chat and to exchange files  the mp  encoding  which was standardized in      and which substantially reduced the size of audio files  grew to widespread use in the late     s  in       mp  com and audiogalaxy were established  the digital millennium copyright act was unanimously passed  and the first mp  player devices were launched citation needed    in june       napster was released as an unstructured centralized peer to peer system   requiring a central server for indexing and peer discovery  it is generally credited as being the first peer to peer file sharing system     gnutella  edonkey      and freenet were released in       as mp  com and napster were facing litigation  gnutella  released in march  was the first decentralized file sharing network  in the gnutella network  all connecting software was considered equal  and therefore the network had no central point of failure  in july  freenet was released and became the first anonymity network  in september the edonkey     client and server software was released citation needed    in       kazaa and poisoned for the mac was released  its fasttrack network was distributed  though unlike gnutella  it assigned more traffic to  supernodes  to increase routing efficiency  the network was proprietary and encrypted  and the kazaa team made substantial efforts to keep other clients such as morpheus off of the fasttrack network citation needed    in july       napster was sued by several recording companies and lost in a m records  inc  v  napster  inc    in the case of napster  it has been ruled that an online service provider could not use the  transitory network transmission  safe harbor in the dmca if they had control of the network with a server      shortly after its loss in court  napster was shut down to comply with a court order  this drove users to other p p applications and file sharing continued its growth   the audiogalaxy satellite client grew in popularity  and the limewire client and bittorrent protocol were released  until its decline in       kazaa was the most popular file sharing program despite bundled malware and legal battles in the netherlands  australia  and the united states  in       a tokyo district court ruling shut down file rogue  and the recording industry association of america  riaa  filed a lawsuit that effectively shut down audiogalaxy     from      through       a number of bittorrent services were established  including suprnova org  isohunt  torrentspy  and the pirate bay  in       the riaa was filing lawsuits against kazaa users  as a result of such lawsuits  many universities added file sharing regulations in their school administrative codes  though some students managed to circumvent them during after school hours   with the shutdown of edonkey in       emule became the dominant client of the edonkey network  in       police raids took down the razorback  edonkey server and temporarily took down the pirate bay citation needed    in       the pirate bay trial ended in a guilty verdict for the primary founders of the tracker  the decision was appealed  leading to a second guilty verdict in november       in october       limewire was forced to shut down following a court order in arista records llc v  lime group llc but the gnutella network remains active through open source clients like frostwire and gtk gnutella  furthermore  multi protocol file sharing software such as mldonkey and shareaza adapted in order to support all the major file sharing protocols  so users no longer had to install and configure multiple file sharing programs citation needed    on january           the united states department of justice shut down the popular domain of megaupload  established        the file sharing site has claimed to have over            people a day   kim dotcom  formerly kim schmitz  was arrested in new zealand and is awaiting extradition   the case involving the downfall of the world s largest and most popular file sharing site was not well received  with hacker group anonymous bringing down several sites associated with the take down   in the following days  other file sharing sites began to cease services  filesonic blocked public downloads on january     with fileserve following suit on january    citation needed    in      there were an estimated    million people participating in online file sharing   according to a cbs news poll in           of americans who follow the file sharing issue  considered it acceptable  if a person owns the music cd and shares it with a limited number of friends and acquaintances   with    to    year olds this percentage reached as much as          according to david glenn  writing in the chronicle of higher education   a majority of economic studies have concluded that file sharing hurts sales     a literature review by professor peter tschmuck found    independent studies on the effects of music file sharing   of these    studies       roughly two thirds   conclude that unauthorized downloads have a  negative or even highly negative impact  on recorded music sales  three of the studies found no significant impact while the remaining five found a positive impact            a study by economists felix oberholzer gee and koleman strumpf in      concluded that music file sharing s effect on sales was  statistically indistinguishable from zero       this research was disputed by other economists  most notably stan liebowitz  who said oberholzer gee and strumpf had made multiple assumptions about the music industry  that are just not correct         in june       billboard reported that oberholzer gee and strumpf had  changed their minds   now finding  no more than     of the recent decline in sales is due to sharing     however  citing nielsen soundscan as their source  the co authors maintained that illegal downloading had not deterred people from being original   in many creative industries  monetary incentives play a reduced role in motivating authors to remain creative  data on the supply of new works are consistent with the argument that file sharing did not discourage authors and publishers  since the advent of file sharing  the production of music  books  and movies has increased sharply     glenn peoples of billboard disputed the underlying data  saying  soundscan s number for new releases in any given year represents new commercial titles  not necessarily new creative works     the riaa likewise responded that  new releases  and  new creative works  are two separate things   this figure includes re releases  new compilations of existing songs  and new digital only versions of catalog albums  soundscan has also steadily increased the number of retailers  especially non traditional retailers  in their sample over the years  better capturing the number of new releases brought to market  what oberholzer and strumpf found was better ability to track new album releases  not greater incentive to create them        a      study prepared by birgitte andersen and marion frenz  published by industry canada  was  unable to discover any direct relationship between p p file sharing and cd purchases in canada     the results of this survey were similarly criticized by academics and a subsequent revaluation of the same data by dr  george r  barker of the australian national university reached the opposite conclusion     in total      of p p downloaders responded that if p p were not available they would have purchased either through paid sites only       cds only       or through cds and pay sites        only     of people say they would not have bought the music if it were not available on p p for free   barker thus concludes   this clearly suggests p p network availability is reducing music demand of     of music downloaders which is quite contrary to andersen and frenz s much published claim        a paper in journal management science found that file sharing decreased the chance of survival for low ranked albums on music charts and increased exposure to albums that were ranked high on the music charts  allowing popular and well known artists to remain on the music charts more often  this had a negative impact for new and less known artists while promoting the work of already popular artists and celebrities       a more recent study that examined pre release file sharing of music albums  using bittorrent software  also discovered positive impacts for  established and popular artists but not newer and smaller artists   according to robert g  hammond of north carolina state university  an album that leaked one month early would see a modest increase in sales   this increase in sales is small relative to other factors that have been found to affect album sales       file sharing proponents commonly argue that file sharing democratizes music consumption by  leveling the playing field  for new small artists relative to established popular artists  by allowing artists to have their work heard by a wider audience  lessening the advantage held by established popular artists in terms of promotional and other support  my results suggest that the opposite is happening  which is consistent with evidence on file sharing behavior        billboard cautioned that this research looked only at the pre release period and not continuous file sharing following a release date   the problem in believing piracy helps sales is deciding where to draw the line between legal and illegal     implicit in the study is the fact that both buyers and sellers are required in order for pre release file sharing to have a positive impact on album sales  without itunes  amazon and best buy  file sharers would be just file sharers rather than purchasers  if you carry out the  file sharing should be legal  argument to its logical conclusion  today s retailers will be tomorrow s file sharing services that integrate with their respective cloud storage services        many argue that file sharing has forced the owners of entertainment content to make it more widely available legally through fee or advertising on demand on the internet  rather than remain static with tv  radio  dvds  cds  and the theater  content for purchase has been higher than illegal in north america aggregate internet traffic since at least            file sharing raises copyright issues and has led to many lawsuits  in the united states  some of these lawsuits have even reached the supreme court  for example  in mgm v  grokster  the supreme court ruled that the creators of p p networks can be held liable if their software is marketed as a tool for copyright infringement     on the other hand  not all file sharing is illegal  content in the public domain can be freely shared  even works covered by copyright can be shared under certain circumstances  for example  some artists  publishers  and record labels grant the public a license for unlimited distribution of certain works  sometimes with conditions  and they advocate free content and file sharing as a promotional tool
