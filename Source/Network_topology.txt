 network topology is the arrangement of the various elements  links  nodes  etc   of a computer network    essentially  it is the topological  structure of a network and may be depicted physically or logically  physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network  including device location and cable installation  while logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network  regardless of its physical design  distances between nodes  physical interconnections  transmission rates  or signal types may differ between two networks  yet their topologies may be identical     an example is a local area network  lan   any given node in the lan has one or more physical links to other devices in the network  graphically mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the physical topology of the network  conversely  mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology of the network             there are two basic categories of network topologies   physical topologies and logical topologies     the cabling layout used to link devices is the physical topology of the network  this refers to the layout of cabling  the locations of nodes  and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling   the physical topology of a network is determined by the capabilities of the network access devices and media  the level of control or fault tolerance desired  and the cost associated with cabling or telecommunications circuits     the logical topology in contrast  is the way that the signals act on the network media  or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices  a network s logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology  for example  the original twisted pair ethernet using repeater hubs was a logical bus topology with a physical star topology layout  token ring is a logical ring topology  but is wired a physical star from the media access unit     the logical classification of network topologies generally follows the same classifications as those in the physical classifications of network topologies but describes the path that the data takes between nodes being used as opposed to the actual physical connections between nodes  the logical topologies are generally determined by network protocols as opposed to being determined by the physical layout of cables  wires  and network devices or by the flow of the electrical signals  although in many cases the paths that the electrical signals take between nodes may closely match the logical flow of data  hence the convention of using the terms logical topology and signal topology interchangeably     logical topologies are often closely associated with media access control methods and protocols  logical topologies are able to be dynamically reconfigured by special types of equipment such as routers and switches     the study of network topology recognizes eight basic topologies   point to point  bus  star  ring or circular  mesh  tree  hybrid  or daisy chain     the simplest topology with a permanent link between two endpoints  switched point to point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony  the value of a permanent point to point network is unimpeded communications between the two endpoints  the value of an on demand point to point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as metcalfe s law     the value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers  assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints  up to and including all the endpoints  is approximated by reed s law     a tree topology is essentially a combination of bus topology and star topology  the nodes of bus topology are replaced with standalone star topology networks  this results in both disadvantages of bus topology and advantages of star topology     for example  if the connection between two groups of networks is broken down due to breaking of the connection on the central linear core  then those two groups cannot communicate  much like nodes of a bus topology  however  the star topology nodes will effectively communicate with each other     it has a root node  intermediate nodes  and ultimate nodes  this structure is arranged in a hierarchical form and any intermediate node can have any number of the child nodes     nbut the tree topology is practically impossible to construct  because the node in the network is nothing  but the computing device can have maximum one or two connections  so we cannot attach more than   child nodes to the computing device  or parent node   there are many sub structures under tree topology  but the most convenient is b tree topology whereby finding errors is relatively easy         hybrid networks use a combination of any two or more topologies  in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies  e g   bus  star  ring  etc    for example a tree network connected to a tree network is still a tree network topology  a hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected  two common examples for hybrid network are  star ring network and star bus network    while grid and torus networks have found popularity in high performance computing applications  some systems have used genetic algorithms to design custom networks that have the fewest possible hops in between different nodes  some of the resulting layouts are nearly incomprehensible  although they function quite well citation needed    a snowflake topology is really a  star of stars  network  so it exhibits characteristics of a hybrid network topology but is not composed of two different basic network topologies being connected     except for star based networks  the easiest way to add more computers into a network is by daisy chaining  or connecting each computer in series to the next  if a message is intended for a computer partway down the line  each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination  a daisy chained network can take two basic forms  linear and ring     the star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes  computers  etc   to a central node  when the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as ethernet  this central node  traditionally a hub  rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network  sometimes including the originating node  all peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to  and receiving from  the central node only  the failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others  but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected  however  the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes     if the central node is passive  the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission  delayed by the two way round trip transmission time  i e  to and from the central node  plus any delay generated in the central node  an active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo related problems     a tree topology  a k a  hierarchical topology  can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy  this tree has individual peripheral nodes  e g  leaves  which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators  unlike the star network  the functionality of the central node may be distributed     as in the conventional star network  individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single point failure of a transmission path to the node  if a link connecting a leaf fails  that leaf is isolated  if a connection to a non leaf node fails  an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest     to alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes  more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network  these network switches will  learn  the layout of the network by  listening  on each port during normal data transmission  examining the data packets and recording the address identifier of each connected node and which port it is connected to in a lookup table held in memory  this lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only     in a mesh topology  i e   a partially connected mesh topology   there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths to be used in case the link providing one of the paths fails  this decentralization is often used to compensate for the single point failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node  e g   in star and tree networks   a special kind of mesh  limiting the number of hops between two nodes  is a hypercube  the number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement  but their decentralized nature makes them very useful  in      the ieee published the shortest path bridging protocol to ease configuration tasks and allows all paths to be active which increases bandwidth and redundancy between all devices             this is similar in some ways to a grid network  where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions  a multidimensional ring has a toroidal topology  for instance     a fully connected network  complete topology  or full mesh topology is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes  in a fully connected network with n nodes  there are n n      direct links  networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up  but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes  this topology is mostly seen in military applications
