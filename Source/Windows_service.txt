 in windows nt operating systems  a windows service is a computer program that operates in the background   it is similar in concept to a unix daemon   a windows service must conform to the interface rules and protocols of the service control manager  the component responsible for managing windows services      windows services can be configured to start when the operating system is started and run in the background as long as windows is running  alternatively  they can be started manually or by an event  windows nt operating systems include numerous services which run in context of three user accounts  system  network service and local service  these windows components are often associated with host process for windows services  because windows services operate in the context of their own dedicated user accounts  they can operate when a user is not logged on     prior to windows vista  services installed as an  interactive service  could interact with windows desktop and show a graphical user interface  in windows vista  however  interactive services are deprecated and may not operate properly  as a result of windows service hardening               windows administrators can manage services via     the services snap in  built upon microsoft management console  can connect to the local computer or a remote computer on the network  enabling users to      the command line peer of the services snap in is sc exe  the  service control  utility   this utility is included with windows xp  and later      sc exe s scope of management is restricted to the local computer  however  starting with windows server       not only can sc exe do all that the services snap in does  but it can also install and uninstall services      windows powershell can intrinsically manage windows services via the following cmdlets     in addition to the trio of snap in  sc exe and powershell  windows also includes components that can do a subset of what the trio can do  net exe can start  stop  pause or resume a windows service    in windows vista and later  windows task manager can show a list of installed services and start or stop them  msconfig can enable or disable  see startup type description above  windows services     a windows service is created using development tools such as microsoft visual studio or embarcadero delphi  in order to be a windows service  a program needs to be written in such a way that it can handle start  stop  and pause messages from the service control manager  service control manager is a component of windows which is responsible for starting and stopping services     the windows resource kit for windows nt       windows nt     and windows      provides tools to control the use and registration of services  srvany exe acts as a service wrapper to handle the interface expected of a service  e g  handle service_start and respond sometime later with service_started or service_failed  and allow any executable or script to be configured as a service  sc exe allows new services to be installed  started  stopped and uninstalled
