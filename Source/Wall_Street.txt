 wall street is a     mile long     xa km  street running eight blocks  roughly northwest to southeast  from broadway to south street on the east river in lower manhattan in the financial district of new york city   over time  the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the united states as a whole  the american financial sector  even if financial firms are not physically located there   or signifying new york based financial interests      anchored by wall street  new york city has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world       and the city is home to the world s two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization  the new york stock exchange and nasdaq    several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the wall street area  including the new york mercantile exchange  the new york board of trade  and the former american stock exchange             there are varying accounts about how the dutch named  de waal straat    got its name  a generally accepted version is that the name of the street was derived from an earthen wall on the northern boundary of the new amsterdam settlement  perhaps to protect against english colonial encroachment or incursions by native americans  a conflicting explanation is that wall street was named after walloons  the dutch name for walloon is waal    among the first settlers that embarked on the ship  nieu nederlandt  in      were    walloon families  the dutch word  wal  can be translated as palisade  however  even some english maps show the name as waal straat  and not as wal straat       one version of the story is worth quoting   the red people from manhattan island crossed to the mainland  where a treaty was made with the dutch  and the place was therefore called the pipe of peace  in their language  hoboken  but soon after that  the dutch governor  kieft  sent his men out there one night and massacred the entire population  few of them escaped  but they spread the story of what had been done  and this did much to antagonize all the remaining tribes against all the white settlers  shortly after  nieuw amsterdam erected a double palisade for defense against its now enraged red neighbors  and this remained for some time the northern limit of the dutch city  the space between the former walls is now called wall street  and its spirit is still that of a bulwark against the people         in the     s  basic picket and plank fences denoted plots and residences in the colony    later  on behalf of the dutch west india company  peter stuyvesant  using both african slaves   and white colonists  collaborated with the city government in the construction of a more substantial fortification  a strengthened    foot   xa m  wall    in       surveyors laid out wall street along the lines of the original stockade    the wall started at pearl street  which was the shoreline at that time  crossing the indian path broadway and ending at the other shoreline  today s trinity place   where it took a turn south and ran along the shore until it ended at the old fort  in these early days  local merchants and traders would gather at disparate spots to buy and sell shares and bonds  and over time divided themselves into two classes auctioneers and dealers    wall street was also the marketplace where owners could hire out their slaves by the day or week    the rampart was removed in            on december           the new york city common council made wall street the city s first official slave market for the sale and rental of enslaved africans and indians         in the late   th century  there was a buttonwood tree at the foot of wall street under which traders and speculators would gather to trade securities    the benefit was being in proximity to each other    in       traders formalized their association with the buttonwood agreement which was the origin of the new york stock exchange    the idea of the agreement was to make the market more  structured  and  without the manipulative auctions   with a commission structure    persons signing the agreement agreed to charge each other a standard commission rate  persons not signing could still participate but would be charged a higher commission for dealing       in       wall street was the scene of the united states  first presidential inauguration when george washington took the oath of office on the balcony of federal hall on april           this was also the location of the passing of the bill of rights  in the cemetery of trinity church  alexander hamilton  who was the first treasury secretary and  architect of the early united states financial system   is buried       in the first few decades  both residences and businesses occupied the area  but increasingly business predominated   there are old stories of people s houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can t get anything done   according to a historian named burrows    the opening of the erie canal in the early   th century meant a huge boom in business for new york city  since it was the only major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the great lakes  wall street became the  money capital of america        historian charles r  geisst suggested that there has constantly been a  tug of war  between business interests on wall street and authorities in washington  d c     generally during the   th century wall street developed its own  unique personality and institutions  with little outside interference       in the     s and     s  most residents moved further uptown to midtown manhattan because of the increased business use at the lower tip of the island    the civil war had the effect of causing the northern economy to boom  bringing greater prosperity to cities like new york which  came into its own as the nation s banking center  connecting  old world capital and new world ambition   according to one account    j  p  morgan created giant trusts  john d  rockefeller s standard oil moved to new york    between      and       the economy changed from  agricultural to industrial to financial  and new york maintained its leadership position despite these changes  according to historian thomas kessner    new york was second only to london as the world s financial capital       in       charles h  dow began tracking stocks  initially beginning with    stocks  mostly railroads  and looked at average prices for these eleven    when the average  peaks and troughs  went up consistently  he deemed it a bull market condition  if averages dropped  it was a bear market  he added up prices  and divided by the number of stocks to get his dow jones average  dow s numbers were a  convenient benchmark  for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market  in       the original stock report  customers  afternoon letter  became the wall street journal  named in reference to the actual street  it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in new york city    after october          it began publishing dow s expanded list of stocks    a century later  there were    stocks in the average     business writer john brooks in his book once in golconda considered the start of the   th century period to have been wall street s heyday    the address of    wall street where the headquarters of j  p  morgan   company  known as the corner  was  the precise center  geographical as well as metaphorical  of financial america and even of the financial world        wall street has had changing relationships with government authorities  in       for example  when authorities proposed a    tax on stock transfers  stock clerks protested    at other times  city and state officials have taken steps through tax incentives to encourage financial firms to continue to do business in the city     in the late   th and early   th centuries  the corporate culture of new york was a primary center for the construction of skyscrapers  and was rivaled only by chicago on the american continent  there were also residential sections  such as the bowling green section between broadway and the hudson river  and between vesey street and the battery  the bowling green area was described as  wall street s back yard  with poor people  high infant mortality rates  and the  worst housing conditions in the city     as a result of the construction  looking at new york city from the east  one can see two distinct clumps of tall buildings the financial district on the left  and the taller midtown district on the right  the geology of manhattan is well suited for tall buildings  with a solid mass of bedrock underneath manhattan providing a firm foundation for tall buildings  skyscrapers are expensive to build  but when there is a  short supply of land  in a  desirable location   then building upwards makes sound financial sense    a post office was built at    wall street in         during the world war i years  occasionally there were fund raising efforts for projects such as the national guard       on september           close to the corner of wall and broad street  the busiest corner of the financial district and across the offices of the morgan bank  a powerful bomb exploded  it killed    and seriously injured     people    the perpetrators were never identified or apprehended  the explosion did  however  help fuel the red scare that was underway at the time  a report from the new york times     the tomb like silence that settles over wall street and lower broadway with the coming of night and the suspension of business was entirely changed last night as hundreds of men worked under the glare of searchlights to repair the damage to skyscrapers that were lighted up from top to bottom      the assay office  nearest the point of explosion  naturally suffered the most  the front was pierced in fifty places where the cast iron slugs  which were of the material used for window weights  were thrown against it  each slug penetrated the stone an inch or two and chipped off pieces ranging from three inches to a foot in diameter  the ornamental iron grill work protecting each window was broken or shattered      the assay office was a wreck      it was as though some gigantic force had overturned the building and then placed it upright again  leaving the framework uninjured but scrambling everything inside               the area was subjected to numerous threats  one bomb threat in      led to detectives sealing off the area to  prevent a repetition of the wall street bomb explosion        in september      was the peak of the market    on october         was when the market started to slip  and it went throughout the week of the   th    in october       renowned yale economist irving fisher reassured worried investors that their  money was safe  on wall street    a few days later  on october       stock values plummeted  the stock market crash of      ushered in the great depression in which a quarter of working people were unemployed  with soup kitchens  mass foreclosures of farms  and falling prices    during this era  development of the financial district stagnated  and wall street  paid a heavy price  and  became something of a backwater in american life        during the new deal years as well as the     s  there was much less focus on wall street and finance  the government clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit  but these policies began to ease  from            stocks could not be purchased  on margin   meaning that an investor had to pay      of a stock s cost without taking on any loans    but this margin requirement was reduced four times before       each time stimulating a mini rally and boosting volume  and when the federal reserve reduced the margin requirements from     to        these changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit    the growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the     s  with some down years during the early     s in the aftermath of the vietnam war  trading volumes climbed  in       according to time magazine  volume hit     million shares a day which caused a  traffic jam  of paper with  batteries of clerks  working overtime to  clear transactions and update customer accounts        in       the financial community posted a collective loss of      million  which spurred temporary help from the government    reforms were instituted  the sec eliminated fixed commissions  which forced  brokers to compete freely with one another for investors  business     in       the securities   exchange commission threw out the nyse s  rule      which had required that  most stock transactions take place on the big board s floor   in effect freeing up trading for electronic methods    in       banks were allowed to buy and sell stocks  which provided more competition for stockbrokers    reforms had the effect of lowering prices overall  making it easier for more people to participate in the stock market    broker commissions for each stock sale lessened  but volume increased       the reagan years were marked by a renewed push for capitalism  business  with national efforts to de regulate industries such as telecommunications and aviation  the economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early     s of languishing  a report in the new york times described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts  with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small  a reporter wrote     the wall street drug dealer looked like many other successful young female executives  stylishly dressed and wearing designer sunglasses  she sat in her      chevrolet camaro in a no parking zone across the street from the marine midland bank branch on lower broadway  the customer in the passenger seat looked like a successful young businessman  but as the dealer slipped him a heat sealed plastic envelope of cocaine and he passed her cash  the transaction was being watched through the sunroof of her car by federal drug agents in a nearby building  and the customer   an undercover agent himself  was learning the ways  the wiles and the conventions of wall street s drug subculture     peter kerr in the new york times             in       the stock market plunged   and  in the relatively brief recession following  lower manhattan lost         jobs according to one estimate    since telecommunications costs were coming down  banks and brokerage firms could move away from wall street to more affordable locations    the recession of         was marked by office vacancy rates downtown which were  persistently high  and with some buildings  standing empty     the day of the drop  october     was marked by  stony faced traders whose sense of humor had abandoned them and in the exhaustion of stock exchange employees struggling to maintain orderly trading     ironically  it was the same year that oliver stone s movie wall street appeared  in       city authorities offered the lower manhattan revitalization plan which offered incentives to convert commercial properties to residential use       construction of the world trade center began in      but had trouble attracting tenants when completed  nonetheless  some substantial firms purchased space there  its impressive height helped make it a visual landmark for drivers and pedestrians  in some respects  the nexus of the financial district moved from the street of wall street to the trade center complex  real estate growth during the latter part of the     s was significant  with deals and new projects happening in the financial district and elsewhere in manhattan  one firm invested more than     billion in various projects  many in the wall street area    in       the nyse and the city struck a      million deal which kept the nyse from moving across the river to jersey city  the deal was described as the  largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town     a competitor to the nyse  nasdaq  moved its headquarters from washington to new york       in       the big board  as some termed the nyse  was described as the world s  largest and most prestigious stock market     but when the world trade center was destroyed on september           it left an architectural void as new developments since the     s had played off the complex aesthetically  the attacks  crippled  the communications network    one estimate was that     of wall street s  best office space  had been lost    the physical destruction was immense     debris littered some streets of the financial district  national guard members in camouflage uniforms manned checkpoints  abandoned coffee carts  glazed with dust from the collapse of the world trade center  lay on their sides across sidewalks  most subway stations were closed  most lights were still off  most telephones did not work  and only a handful of people walked in the narrow canyons of wall street yesterday morning     leslie eaton and kirk johnson of the new york times  september                still  the nyse was determined to re open on september     almost a week after the attack    the attack hastened a trend towards financial firms moving to midtown and contributed to the loss of business on wall street  due to temporary to permanent relocation to new jersey and further decentralization with establishments transferred to cities like chicago  denver  and boston     after september     the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year end bonuses of      billion  according to one estimate from a state comptroller s office    many brokers are paid mostly through commission  and get a token annual salary which is dwarfed by the year end bonus     to guard against a vehicular bombing in the area  authorities built concrete barriers  and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending       to       apiece on bollards     to prevent a vehicle delivered bomb from entering the area  rogers marvel designed a new kind of bollard  a faceted piece of sculpture whose broad  slanting surfaces offer people a place to sit in contrast to the typical bollard  which is supremely unsittable  the bollard  which is called the nogo  looks a bit like one of frank gehry s unorthodox culture palaces  but it is hardly insensitive to its surroundings  its bronze surfaces actually echo the grand doorways of wall street s temples of commerce  pedestrians easily slip through groups of them as they make their way onto wall street from the area around historic trinity church  cars  however  cannot pass     blair kamin in the chicago tribune            wall street itself and the financial district as a whole are crowded with highrises  further  the loss of the world trade center has spurred development on a scale that had not been seen in decades  in       goldman sachs began building a tower near the former trade center site    tax incentives provided by federal  state and local governments encouraged development  a new world trade center complex  centered on daniel libeskind s memory foundations plan  is in the early stages of development and one building has already been replaced  the centerpiece to this plan is the       foot     xa m  tall   world trade center  formerly known as the freedom tower   new residential buildings are sprouting up  and buildings that were previously office space are being converted to residential units  also benefiting from tax incentives  a new fulton center is planned to improve access  in       the maharishi global financial capital of new york opened headquarters at    broad street near the nyse  in an effort to seek investors       the guardian reporter andrew clark described the years of      to      as  tumultous  in which the heartland of america is  mired in gloom  with high unemployment around       with average house prices falling from          in      to           and foreboding increases in the national debt to       trillion  but that despite the setbacks  the american economy was once more  bouncing back     what had happened during these heady years  clark wrote     but the picture is too nuanced simply to dump all the responsibility on financiers  most wall street banks didn t actually go around the us hawking dodgy mortgages  they bought and packaged loans from on the ground firms such as countrywide financial and new century financial  both of which hit a financial wall in the crisis  foolishly and recklessly  the banks didn t look at these loans adequately  relying on flawed credit rating agencies such as standard   poor s and moody s  which blithely certified toxic mortgage backed securities as solid    a few of those on wall street  including maverick hedge fund manager john paulson and the top brass at goldman sachs  spotted what was going on and ruthlessly gambled on a crash  they made a fortune but turned into the crisis s pantomime villains  most  though  got burned   the banks are still gradually running down portfolios of non core loans worth     bn     the guardian reporter andrew clark             the first months of      was a particularly troublesome period which caused federal reserve chairman ben bernanke to  work holidays and weekends  and which did an  extraordinary series of moves     it bolstered u s  banks and allowed wall street firms to borrow  directly from the fed     these efforts were highly controversial at the time  but from the perspective of       it appeared the federal exertions had been the right decisions  by       wall street firms  in clark s view  were  getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth  prosperity and excess     a report by michael stoler in the new york sun described a  phoenix like resurrection  of the area  with residential  commercial  retail and hotels booming in the  third largest business district in the country     at the same time  the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms  including the wall street reform and consumer protection act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements    the nyse closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange    beginning in september       demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around wall street       wall street investment banking fees in      totaled approximately     billion    while senior bank officers managing risk and compliance functions earned as much as          annually in new york city in            wall street s architecture is generally rooted in the gilded age  though there are also some art deco influences in the neighborhood  the streets in the area were laid out prior to the commissioners  plan of       a grid plan that dictates the placement of most of manhattan s streets north of houston street  thus  it has small streets  barely wide enough for a single lane of traffic are bordered on both sides by some of the tallest buildings in the city   according to one description  which creates  breathtaking artificial canyons  offering spectacular views in some instances    construction in such narrow steep areas has resulted in occasional accidents such as a crane collapse    one report divided lower manhattan into three basic districts       landmark buildings on wall street include federal hall     wall street  bankers trust company building      wall street  the trump building  the new york stock exchange at the corner of broad street and the us headquarters of deutsche bank at    wall street  the deutsche bank building  formerly the j p  morgan headquarters  makes deutsche bank the last remaining major investment bank to have its headquarters on wall street     the older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facade  which have not been common in corporate architecture for decades  the nearby world trade center  built in the     s  was very plain and utilitarian in comparison  excavation from the world trade center was later used as landfill for battery park city residential developments       wall street  built in       was known as the  house of morgan  and served for decades as the bank s headquarters and  by some accounts  was viewed as an important address in american finance     a key anchor for the area is the new york stock exchange  city authorities realize its importance  and believed that it has  outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of wall and broad streets   and in      offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the financial district    plans to rebuild it were delayed by the events of         in       the exchange still occupies the same site  the exchange is the locus for an impressive amount of technology and data  for example  to accommodate the three thousand persons who work directly on the exchange floor requires       kilowatts of electricity  along with       phone circuits on the trading floor alone  and     miles of fiber optic cable below ground       during most of the   th century  wall street was a business community with practically only offices which emptied out at night  a report in the new york times in      described a  deathlike stillness that settles on the district after      and all day saturday and sunday     but there has been a change towards greater residential use of the area  pushed forwards by technological changes and shifting market conditions  the general pattern is for several hundred thousand workers to commute into the area during the day  sometimes by sharing a taxicab   from other parts of the city as well as from new jersey and long island  and then leave at night  in       only     people lived  south of chambers street   by              people were residents with the addition of areas such as battery park city   and southbridge towers    battery park city was built on    acres of landfill  and       people moved there beginning about       but by      there was evidence of more shops and stores and a park  along with plans for more residential development       according to one description in        the area dies at night     it needs a neighborhood  a community     during the past two decades there has been a shift towards greater residential living areas in the wall street area  with incentives from city authorities in some instances    many empty office buildings have been converted to lofts and apartments  for example  the office building of harry sinclair  the oil magnate involved with the teapot dome scandal  was converted to a co op in         in       a fifth of buildings and warehouses were empty  and many were converted to living areas    some conversions met with problems  such as aging gargoyles on building exteriors having to be expensively restored to meet with current building codes    residents in the area have sought to have a supermarket  a movie theater  a pharmacy  more schools  and a  good diner     the discount retailer named job lot used to be located at the world trade center but moved to church street  merchants bought extra unsold items at steep prices and sold them as a discount to consumers and shoppers included  thrifty homemakers and browsing retirees  who  rubbed elbows with city hall workers and wall street executives   but the firm went bust in            there were reports that the number of residents increased by     during the     s to about          although a second estimate  based on the      census based on a different map  places the residential  nighttime and weekend  population in      at           by       there were several grocery stores  dry cleaners  and two grade schools and a top high school    there is a barber shop across from the new york stock exchange which has been there a long time    by       there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a    hour neighborhood  although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent    there were ten hotels and thirteen museums by         stuyvesant high school moved to its present location near battery park city in      and has been described as one of the nation s premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics    in       the french fashion retailer herm s opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a         custom made leather dressage saddle or a         limited edition alligator briefcase     some streets have been designated as pedestrian only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times    there are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city    by       the residential population had increased to        residents   with crime statistics showing no murders in         the area is growing with luxury high end apartments and upscale retailers       wall street is a major location of tourism in new york city  one report described lower manhattan as  swarming with camera carrying tourists     tour guides highlight places such as trinity church  the federal reserve gold vaults    feet below street level  worth      billion   and the nyse    a scoundrels of wall street tour is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers  who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them     occasionally artists make impromptu performances  for example  in       a troupe of    dancers  contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks and crannies of the financial district in bodies in urban spaces  choreographed by willi donner    one chief attraction  the federal reserve building in lower manhattan  paid          to open a visitors  gallery in         the new york stock exchange and the american stock exchange also spent money in the late     s to upgrade facilities for visitors    attractions include the gold vault beneath the federal reserve and that  staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the statue of liberty        finance professor charles r  geisst wrote that the exchange has become  inextricably intertwined into new york s economy     wall street pay  in terms of salaries and bonuses and taxes  is an important part of the economy of new york city  the tri state metropolitan area  and the united states  in       after a downturn in the stock market  the decline meant     billion less in taxable income  with less money available for  apartments  furniture  cars  clothing and services     a falloff in wall street s economy could have  wrenching effects on the local and regional economies        estimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city  one estimate was that wall street firms employed close to         persons in         another estimate was that in       the financial services industry which had a     billion profit became    percent of the city s revenue    another estimate  in       was that the financial services industry makes up    of the city s work force and     of the tax base    an additional estimate        from steve malanga of the manhattan institute was that the securities industry accounts for     percent of the jobs in new york city but      percent of its wages  and he estimated there were         securities industries jobs in new york  both wall street area and midtown  paying an average of          annually    between      and       the sector grew at an annual rate of about      annually  a respectable rate  but that other financial centers were growing faster    another estimate        was that wall street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city  and     of new york city s tax revenue    the city s securities industry  enumerating         jobs in august       continues to form the largest segment of the city s financial sector and an important economic engine  accounting in      for   percent of private sector jobs in new york city      percent  us     billion  of the city s tax revenue  and    percent of the city s total wages  including an average salary of us               the seven largest wall street firms in the     s  decade  were bear stearns  jpmorgan chase  citigroup incorporated  goldman sachs  morgan stanley  merrill lynch and lehman brothers    during the recession of          many of these firms went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms  in       lehman filed for bankruptcy    bear stearns was bought by jp morgan chase   forced by the u s  government    and merrill lynch was bought by bank of america in a similar shot gun wedding  these failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of wall street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change  since new york s financial industry provides almost one fourth of all income produced in the city  and accounts for     of the city s tax revenues and     of the state s  the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries    new york s mayor michael bloomberg reportedly over a four year period dangled over      million in tax incentives to persuade goldman sachs to build a    story headquarters in the financial district near the destroyed world trade center site    in       things looked somewhat gloomy  with one analysis by the boston consulting group suggesting that        jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn    but there were signs that manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of    annually in       and bonuses were being paid once more  with average bonuses over          in            a requirement of the new york stock exchange was that brokerage firms had to have offices  clustered around wall street  so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week    there were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by         but as technology progressed  in the middle and later decades of the   th century  computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications  meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations    many financial firms found that they could move to midtown manhattan four miles away   or elsewhere and still operate effectively  for example  the former investment firm of donaldson  lufkin   jenrette was described as a wall street firm but had its headquarters on park avenue in midtown    a report described the migration from wall street     the financial industry has been slowly migrating from its historic home in the warren of streets around wall street to the more spacious and glamorous office towers of midtown manhattan  morgan stanley  j p  morgan chase  citigroup  and bear stearns have all moved north     usa today  october            nevertheless  a key magnet for the wall street remains the new york stock exchange  some  old guard  firms such as goldman sachs and merrill lynch  bought by bank of america in        have remained  fiercely loyal to the financial district  location  and new ones such as deutsche bank have chosen office space in the district    so called  face to face  trading between buyers and sellers remains a  cornerstone  of the nyse  with a benefit of having all of a deal s players close at hand  including investment bankers  lawyers  and accountants       in       the manhattan financial district is one of the largest business districts in the united states  and second in new york city only to midtown in terms of dollar volume of business transacted     after wall street firms started to expand westward in the     s to new jersey    the direct economic impacts of wall street activities have gone beyond new york city  the employment in the financial services industry mostly in the  back office  roles has become an important part of new jersey economy    in       the wall street employment wages were paid in the amount of almost       billion in the state  the industry contributed       billion or     percent to the new jersey s gross domestic product in the same year       the most significant area with wall street employment is in jersey city  in       the  wall street west  employment contributed to one third of the private sector jobs in jersey city  within the financial service cluster  there were three major sectors  more than    percent were in the securities industry     percent were in banking  and   percent in insurance       additionally  new jersey has become the main technology infrastructure to support the wall street operations  a substantial amount of securities traded in the united states are executed in new jersey as the data centers of electronic trading in the u s  equity market for all major stock exchanges are located in north and central jersey      a significant amount of securities clearing and settlement workforce is also in the state  this includes the majority of the workforce of depository trust company    the primary u s  securities depository  and the depository trust   clearing corporation    the parent company of national securities clearing corporation  the fixed income clearing corporation and emerging markets clearing corporation       having a direct tie to wall street employment is problematic for new jersey  however  the state lost     percent of its employment base from      to      in the financial services sector in the fallout of the subprime mortgage crisis       new york times analyst daniel gross wrote     an example is the alternative trading platform known as bats  based in kansas city  which came  out of nowhere to gain a   percent share in the market for trading united states stocks     the firm has computers in the u s  state of new jersey  two salespersons in new york city  but the remaining    employees work in a center in kansas       wall street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power  to americans  it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics  and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation s history  particularly beginning around the gilded age period in the late   th century  wall street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many americans see as having developed through trade  capitalism  and innovation       wall street has become synonymous with financial interests  often used negatively    during the subprime mortgage crisis from          wall street financing was blamed as one of the causes  although most commentators blame an interplay of factors  the u s  government with the troubled asset relief program bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars  but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated    and was criticized by journalists as well as the public  analyst robert kuttner in the huffington post criticized the bailout as helping large wall street firms such as citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as chicago s shorebank    one writer in the huffington post looked at fbi statistics on robbery  fraud  and crime and concluded that wall street was the  most dangerous neighborhood in the united states  if one factored in the     billion fraud perpetrated by bernie madoff    when large firms such as enron  worldcom and global crossing were found guilty of fraud  wall street was often blamed    even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in wall street  many complained that the resulting sarbanes oxley legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were  overly burdensome     interest groups seeking favor with washington lawmakers  such as car dealers  have often sought to portray their interests as allied with main street rather than wall street  although analyst peter overby on national public radio suggested that car dealers have written over      billion in consumer loans and have real ties with wall street    when the united states treasury bailed out large financial firms  to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation s economy  there was tremendous negative political fallout  particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees    analyst william d  cohan argued that it was  obscene  how wall street reaped  massive profits and bonuses in       after being saved by  trillions of dollars of american taxpayers  treasure  despite wall street s  greed and irresponsible risk taking     washington post reporter suzanne mcgee called for wall street to make a sort of public apology to the nation  and expressed dismay that people such as goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein hadn t expressed contrition despite being sued by the sec in         mcgee wrote that  bankers aren t the sole culprits  but their too glib denials of responsibility and the occasional vague and waffling expression of regret don t go far enough to deflect anger        but chief banking analyst at goldman sachs  richard ramsden  is  unapologetic  and sees  banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy     ramsden believes  risk taking is vital  and said in          you can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail  in which there s no leverage  but there would be a cost  there would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation     richard ramsden of goldman sachs             others in the financial industry believe they ve been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians  for example  anthony scaramucci reportedly told president barack obama in      that he felt like a pi ata   whacked with a stick  by  hostile politicians        the financial misdeeds of various figures throughout american history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole  and include names such as william duer  jim fisk and jay gould  the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the u s  gold market in       as well as modern figures such as bernard madoff who  bilked billions from investors        in addition  images of wall street and its figures have loomed large  the      oliver stone film wall street created the iconic figure of gordon gekko who used the phrase  greed is good   which caught on in the cultural parlance    stone commented in      how the movie had had an unexpected cultural influence  not causing them to turn away from corporate greed  but causing many young people to choose wall street careers because of that movie    a reporter repeated other lines from the film     wall street firms have however also contributed to projects such as habitat for humanity as well as done food programs in haiti and trauma centers in sudan and rescue boats during floods in bangladesh       as a figure of speech contrasted to  main street   the term  wall street  can refer to big business interests against those of small business and the working of middle class  it is sometimes used more specifically to refer to research analysts  shareholders  and financial institutions such as investment banks  whereas  main street  conjures up images of locally owned businesses and banks  the phrase  wall street  is commonly used interchangeably with the phrase  corporate america   it is also sometimes used in contrast to distinguish between the interests  culture  and lifestyles of investment banks and those of fortune     industrial or service corporations     according to the discipline of anthropology  the term culture represents the customs  values  morals  laws and rituals which a particular group or society shares  in the public imagination  wall street represents elitism  finance  economics and greed  however  although wall street employees may exhibit greedy and self interested behaviours to the public  these behaviours are justified through their own value system and social practices  various anthropologists have conducted research on wall street and it is their research which can confirm the negative views of wall street while providing the public with information that can contribute to a better understanding of how wall street workers perceive themselves  anthropologist karen ho  who has conducted ethnographic research on wall street  states in situating global capitalisms that the markets are beginning to self regulate themselves in terms of neoliberalism    through the perception of the public  financial investors take on a role that has already been established for them  it is both appropriate and fitting to call wall street a culture because of the system of values and practices it holds onto  moreover  anthropological insight can help improve the general public s understanding of wall street and in turn allow the public to appreciate the culture of wall street which is both logical and sensible to the workers themselves     professor katarina sj berg argues in the wall street culture that within the media negative images of wall street are painted in terms of the district s market falls  money losses and deceitful gains    however  this is not what wall street investors are bothered by  instead  it is the public s words and opinions which they feel mold their image    sj berg notes that in the american culture  money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable    therefore  wall street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder    they also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates  because it strengthens their position as a wall street employee  they value seeing themselves as experts in their field  especially since they live in a society that values wealth    this justifies their acts of greed  and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected  moreover  they do not regret their actions because to them  it is part of being an american    aside from living up to the public s image  wall street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by karen ho in disciplining investment bankers  disciplining the economy  wall street s institutional culture of crisis  the downsizing of corporate america  she argues that due to the fact that the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity  wall street workers are compensated through their salaries       in situating global capitalisms  a view from wall street investment bankers by karen ho  she interviews a banker who believes that working for wall street puts them at the top of the hierarchal ladder in society  the banker feels that everything goes through wall street  in terms of loans  investments  change or growth    from his point of view  wall street values are embedded in power    similarly to sj berg s article  the wall street culture  she states that as she was entering the new york stock exchange  nyse  to conduct an interview  she was questioned by many employees regarding her purpose  how she gained access into their workplace without an appointment  and how she passed security    in their view  there is a  dividing line between  us on the inside  and  those on the outside      these factors strengthen the power relations as well as establish a hierarchy between them as wall street employees  and the public       additionally  in disciplining investment bankers  disciplining the economy  wall street s institutional culture of crisis and the downsizing of  corporate america   karen ho states that as we continue to learn more about wall street  we learn about each independent banker  as the banker brings their life experiences into the business  we can see the reasons for their actions  each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of wall street  ideally  they live in the moment    however  job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor    therefore  they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security  profit and prosperity for the long run    karen ho wishes for us to see wall street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker  as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure  ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with wall street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives    similarly to regular wage earners  wall street employees are just trying to earn a day s pay  their work is sometimes undervalued  because the public does not see them in this manner  thus  wall street cannot be understood in black and white terms  one needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them  but also reflective of north america s values of individual power  prestige  and social practices based on individualism  for example  throughout the     s and into the     s manhattan was a  white only  community    within that time period  there was a lot of racial segregation    the values of america and the social practices were not like they are today  so african americans were not within the wall street community       literature    movies    music    video games    other    many people associated with wall street have become famous  although in most cases their reputations are limited to members of the stock brokerage and banking communities  others have gained national and international fame  for some  their fame is due to skillful investment strategies  financing  reporting  legal or regulatory activities  while others are remembered for their notable failures or scandal        wall street being historically a commuter destination  much transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it  today  pier    at the foot of the street is a busy terminal for new york waterway and other ferries     the new york city subway serves three stations under wall street     motor traffic  particularly during working hours  is often congested but driving late at night and on weekends can be easier  the roads are not arranged according to midtown s distinctive rectangular grid pattern with staggered lights  but have small often one lane roads with numerous stoplights and stop signs  the fdr drive  east river esplanade  and south street run along the east river  and the downtown manhattan heliport serves
