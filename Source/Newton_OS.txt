 newton os is the discontinued operating system for the apple newton pdas produced by apple from            newton os was written entirely in c   and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently  many applications were pre installed in the rom of the newton  making for quick start up  and to save on ram and flash memory storage for user applications     its use of paragraph s handwriting recognition engine has been noted as a pioneering implementation             newton os featured many interface elements that even mac os didn t have at the time  such as drawers and the  poof  animation  an animation similar to this is found in mac os x  and parts of the newton s handwriting recognition system have been implemented as inkwell in mac os x     many features of the newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of pen computing        shortly after the newton pda s release in       developers were not paying much attention to the new newton os api and were still more interested in developing for the macintosh and windows platforms  it was not until two years later that developers saw a potential market available to them in creating software for newton os  several programs were made by third party developers  including software to enhance the disappointing hand writing recognition technology of newton os   x     the basic software that came with newton os     the newton used the calligrapher word based handwriting recognition engine developed by paragraph international inc  led by former soviet scientist stepan pachikov      the earliest versions had weaknesses that resulted in bad publicity and reviews      however  with the release of newton pdas based upon version     of the os  the handwriting recognition had substantially improved  partially being a product of paragraph and an apple created recognizer pair  apple s rosetta and mondello  newton s handwriting recognition  particularly the print recognizer  has been considered by many reviewers  testers  and users to be the best in the industry  even    years after it was introduced    it was developed by apple s advanced technology group  and was described in      as  the world s first genuinely usable handwriting recognition system        the newton could recognize hand printed text  cursive  or a mix of the two  and could also accept free hand  sketches    shapes   and  ink text   text could also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on screen pop up qwerty keyboard  with  shapes   newton could recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle  a line  a polygon  etc   and it would clean them up into  perfect  vector representations  with modifiable control points and defined vertices  of what the user was attempting to draw   shapes  and  sketches  could be scaled or deformed once drawn   ink text  captured the user s free hand writing but allowed it to be treated somewhat like recognized text when manipulating for later editing purposes   ink text  supported word wrap  could be formatted to be bold  italic  etc      at any time a user could also direct the newton to recognize selected  ink text  and turn it into recognized text  deferred recognition   a newton note document  or the notes attached to each contact in names and each calendar event  could contain any mix of interleaved text  ink text  shapes  and sketches       newton os ran applications written in c    along with an interpreted  user friendly language called newtonscript  these applications are stored in packages
