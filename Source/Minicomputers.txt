 a minicomputer  or colloquially mini  is a class of smaller computers that developed in the mid     s and sold for much less than mainframe and mid size computers from ibm and its direct competitors  in a      survey  the new york times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than        usd  with an input output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory  that is capable of running programs in a higher level language  such as fortran or basic   the class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems  minis were designed for control  instrumentation  human interaction  and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping  many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers  oems  for final end use application  during the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class              almost     companies formed and only a half dozen remained      when single chip cpus appeared  beginning with the intel      in       the term  minicomputer  came to mean a machine that lies in the middle range of the computing spectrum  in between the smallest mainframe computers and the microcomputers  the term  minicomputer  is little used today  the contemporary term for this class of system is  midrange computer   such as the higher end sparc  power architecture and itanium based systems from oracle  ibm and hewlett packard             the term  minicomputer  developed in the     s to describe the smaller computers that became possible with the use of transistors and core memory technologies  minimal instructions sets and less expensive peripherals such as the ubiquitous teletype model    asr  they usually took up one or a few    inch rack cabinets  compared with the large mainframes that could fill a room     the definition of minicomputer is vague with the consequence that there are a number of candidates for the first minicomputer   an early and highly successful minicomputer was digital equipment corporation s  dec     bit pdp    which was built using discrete transistors and cost from us        upwards when launched in       later versions of the pdp   took advantage of small scale integrated circuits  the important precursors of the pdp   include the pdp    linc  the tx    the tx    and the pdp    dec gave rise to a number of minicomputer companies along massachusetts route      including data general  wang laboratories  apollo computer  and prime computer     minicomputers were also known as midrange computers  they grew to have relatively high processing power and capacity  they were used in manufacturing process control  telephone switching and to control laboratory equipment  in the     s  they were the hardware that was used to launch the computer aided design  cad  industry and other similar industries where a smaller dedicated system was needed     the      series of ttl integrated circuits started appearing in minicomputers in the late     s  the       arithmetic logic unit  alu  was commonly used in the cpu data paths  each       had a bus width of four bits  hence the popularity of bit slice architecture  the      series offered data selectors  multiplexers  three state buffers  memories  etc  in dual in line packages with one tenth inch spacing  making major system components and architecture evident to the naked eye  starting in the     s  many minicomputers used vlsi circuits     at the launch of the mits altair      in       radio electronics magazine referred to the system as a  minicomputer   although the term microcomputer soon became usual for personal computers based on single chip microprocessors  at the time  microcomputers were   bit single user  relatively simple machines running simple program launcher operating systems like cp m or ms dos  while minis were much more powerful systems that ran full multi user  multitasking operating systems  such as vms and unix  and although the classical mini was a    bit computer  the emerging higher performance superminis were    bit     the decline of the minis happened due to the lower cost of microprocessor based hardware  the emergence of inexpensive and easily deployable local area network systems  the emergence of the              and the       microprocessors  and the desire of end users to be less reliant on inflexible minicomputer manufacturers and it departments or  data centers   the result was that minicomputers and computer terminals were replaced by networked workstations  file servers and pcs in some installations  beginning in the latter half of the     s     during the     s  the change from minicomputers to inexpensive pc networks was cemented by the development of several versions of unix and unix like systems that ran on the intel x   microprocessor architecture  including solaris  linux  freebsd  netbsd and openbsd  also  the microsoft windows series of operating systems  beginning with windows nt  now included server versions that supported preemptive multitasking and other features required for servers     as microprocessors have become more powerful  the cpus built up from multiple componentsxa   once the distinguishing feature differentiating mainframes and midrange systems from microcomputersxa   have become increasingly obsolete  even in the largest mainframe computers     digital equipment corporation  dec  was once the leading minicomputer manufacturer  at one time the second largest computer company after ibm  but as the minicomputer declined in the face of generic unix servers and intel based pcs  not only dec  but almost every other minicomputer company including data general  prime  computervision  honeywell and wang laboratories  many based in new england  hence the end of the massachusetts miracle   also collapsed or merged  dec was sold to compaq in       while data general was acquired by emc corporation     today only a few proprietary minicomputer architectures survive  the ibm system    operating system  which introduced many advanced concepts  lives on with ibm s as      realising the importance of the myriad lines of  legacy code   programs  written   as  stands for  application system   great efforts were made by ibm to enable programs originally written for the system    and system    to be moved to the as      the as     was replaced by the iseries  which was subsequently replaced by the system i  in       the system i was replaced by the ibm power systems  by contrast  competing proprietary computing architectures from the early     s  such as dec s vax  wang vs and hewlett packard s hp     have long been discontinued without a compatible upgrade path  openvms runs hp alpha and intel ia    itanium  cpu architectures     tandem computers  which specialized in reliable large scale computing  was acquired by compaq  and a few years afterward the combined entity merged with hewlett packard  the nsk based nonstop product line was re ported from mips processors to itanium based processors branded as  hp integrity nonstop servers   as in the earlier migration from stack machines to mips microprocessors  all customer software was carried forward without source changes  integrity nonstop continues to be hp s answer for the extreme scaling needs of its very largest customers  the nsk operating system  now termed nonstop os  continues as the base software environment for the nonstop servers  and has been extended to include support for java and integration with popular development tools like visual studio and eclipse     a variety of companies emerged that built turnkey systems around minicomputers with specialized software and  in many cases  custom peripherals that addressed specialized problems such as computer aided design  computer aided manufacturing  process control  manufacturing resource planning  and so on  many if not most minicomputers were sold through these original equipment manufacturers and value added resellers     several pioneering computer companies first built minicomputers  such as dec  data general  and hewlett packard  hp   who now refers to its hp     minicomputers as  servers  rather than  minicomputers    and although today s pcs and servers are clearly microcomputers physically  architecturally their cpus and operating systems have developed largely by integrating features from minicomputers     in the software context  the relatively simple oss for early microcomputers were usually inspired by minicomputer oss  such as cp m s similarity to digital s single user os   and rt    and multi user rsts time sharing system   also  the multiuser oss of today are often either inspired by  or directly descended from  minicomputer oss  unix was originally a minicomputer os  while windows nt kernel the foundation for all current versions of microsoft windows borrowed design ideas liberally from vms  many of the first generation of pc programmers were educated on minicomputer systems citation needed
