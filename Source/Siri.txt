 siri   s ri  is an application for apple inc  s ios which works as a personal assistant and knowledge navigator  the application uses a natural language user interface to answer questions  make recommendations  and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of web services  the software  both in its original version and as an ios application  adapts to the user s individual language usage and individual searches  preferences  with continuing use  and returns results that are individualized  the name siri is scandinavian  a short form of the norse name sigrid meaning  beauty  and  victory   and comes from the intended name for the original developer s first child      siri was originally introduced as an ios application available in the app store by siri xa inc   which was acquired by apple on april           siri xa inc  had announced that their software would be available for blackberry and for phones running android  but all development efforts for non apple platforms were cancelled after the acquisition by apple      siri has been an integral part of ios since ios    and was introduced as a feature of the iphone  s on october            siri was added to the third generation ipad with the release of ios   in september       and has been included on all ios devices released during or after october                    siri was first launched as an application available on apple s app store in the united states by siri xa inc   it integrated with services such as opentable   google maps    movietickets and taximagic    using voice recognition technology from nuance and their service partners  users could make reservations at specific restaurants  buy movie tickets or get a cab by dictating instructions in natural language to siri    siri was acquired by apple on april           and the original application ceased to function on october               a key feature both of the research and development behind the original sir i  inc  application    and behind its function as an ios application  is its artificial intelligence programming aimed to allow it to adapt to the user s individual language usage and individual searches  preferences  with continuing use  with return of results that are therefore individualized         on october          apple introduced the iphone  s with their implementation of a beta version of siri    the new version of siri is integrated into ios  and offers conversational interaction with many applications  including reminders  weather  stocks  messaging  email  calendar  contacts  notes  music  clocks  web browser  wolfram alpha  and maps    currently  siri supports english  american  canadian  australian  british   french  german  japanese  italian  italy  switzerland   spanish  mexico  spain   mandarin  china  taiwan   korean  and cantonese  on launch  siri had limited functionality outside the united states and canada  however  apple  with the release of ios    added the missing functionality to other countries      siri also replaces  voice control  on previous versions of ios  which could only perform basic tasks such as play music  make calls and open apps     after announcing that siri is included with the iphone  s  apple removed the existing siri app  which ran on all iphone models  from the app store       in october       independent developers stated that they had ported siri into the other ios devices      however  some news sites suggest that the videos posted by the developers as  proof  only show the user interface of the siri software  and not the voice commands  implying that developers have not been able to port the application with full functionality    however  new reports from january      suggest that independent developers have succeeded in porting siri to earlier iphone models  the ipod touch  and ipad  i siri com  a united states based team  have demonstrated siri working as intended on the iphone    ipod touch  and ipad  communicating without the apple servers       in later january       independent developers successfully created and distributed a legal port of siri to older devices via cydia    the port  however  requires authorization keys from another iphone  s  which can be exploited in the form of a proxy server  or by transferring the siri authorization file from an iphone  s    due to this requirement  developers have bypassed apple s siri server completely by creating their own backend using apis from services such as google and wolfram alpha       on june           at apple s wwdc conference  apple announced that siri will be available on the ipad  third generation  beginning in late      with the release of ios    also on june           at apple s wwdc conference  apple announced updates for siri coming in ios    which launched in fall        these new features include  opening apps  telling sports scores and other sports related information  checking movie times  finding restaurants and also ordering reservations  siri can also tell the height of sports players in ios    it also brought some previously us only features  such as google maps and yelp integration  international     on september           apple announced that siri will also be on the iphone     and the ipod touch  fifth generation        on june           apple revealed that siri will have a gender option  meaning that you can choose if siri will sound like a male or a female  with the release of ios         currently  siri is included on the iphone  s  iphone    iphone  c  iphone  s  iphone    iphone   plus   th generation ipod touch   rd generation ipad   th generation ipad  ipad air  ipad air    and all ipad minis     siri is a spin out from the sri international artificial intelligence center  and is an offshoot of the darpa funded calo project      siri was co founded by sri s dag kittlaus  ceo  and adam cheyer  vp engineering  and by tom gruber  cto        siri s primary technical areas focus on a conversational interface  personal context awareness  and service delegation       siri s speech recognition engine is provided by nuance communications  a speech technology company  although this was not officially acknowledged by either apple or nuance until allthingsd conference              the original siri application relied upon a number of partners  including     the sources in apple s implementation of siri differ from the original iphone application  it integrates with default ios functionality  such as contacts  calendars and text messages  it also supports search from google  bing  yahoo  wolfram alpha  google maps  yelp  and wikipedia     siri also contains numerous pre programmed responses to conversational and amusing questions  these are designed to provide an entertainment factor and give siri human like qualities       the original american voice colloquially known as  samantha  was provided by susan bennett in july         reports that the voice was provided by allison dufty were incorrect    which was proved by ed primeau  an american audio and video forensics expert       the british male voice is colloquially known as  daniel  and is voiced by jon briggs  a former technology journalist  the voice was recorded for scansoft  which had merged with nuance communications in october       although apple has never confirmed any involvement of nuance with siri       the australian female voice is colloquially known as  karen  and is voiced by karen jacobsen  an australian born and new york based entertainer  singer  voiceover artist  and songwriter    jacobsen is also the australian voice in gps navigation devices for garmin  mio  navman  and tomtom       siri was first introduced to the world through the automotive industry in april      as a hands free upgrade with ford and honda but fell through when stocks dropped     due to price inflation  in june       former apple svp scott forstall announced that apple had been in discussions with automobile manufacturers and companies to get siri integration as part of a scheme called  siri eyes free  mode to provide eyes and hands free operation  stating that siri could be in vehicles in as soon as    months     the day following the announcement of this unprecedented collaboration between apple and automobile manufacturers  harman international industries s stock immediately fell by      given harman s substantial revenue sources from providing gps  navigation  and telematics systems for vehicles  many in particular manufactured by companies partnering with apple     at wwdc       apple s eddy cue announced a new system called  ios in the car  aimed at integrating siri and other ios functions more fully into native in car systems  like satellite navigation  satnav  and music playback  which was later renamed carplay by apple on march             siri was met with critical acclaim for its ease of use and practicality  as well as its apparent  personality   however  issues did arise when siri was used by consumers from areas with distinct accents  google s executive chairman and former chief  eric schmidt  has conceded that siri could pose a  competitive threat  to the company s core search business       writing in the guardian  journalist charlie brooker considered siri s personality to be unpleasantly servile  but found that the software worked  annoyingly well     siri was criticized by organizations such as the american civil liberties union  aclu  and naral pro choice america after users found that it would not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers  sometimes directing users to pro life crisis pregnancy centers instead  apple responded that this was a glitch which would be fixed in the final version       siri has not been well received by some english speakers with distinctive accents  including scottish   and americans from boston or the south      apple s siri faq states that   as more people use siri and it s exposed to more variations of a language  its overall recognition of dialects and accents will continue to improve  and siri will work even better       in march       frank m  fazio filed a class action lawsuit against apple on behalf of the people who felt misled about the capabilities of siri and failing to function as depicted in apple s siri commercials  fazio filed the lawsuit in california and claimed that the iphone  s is merely a  more expensive iphone  if siri fails to function as advertised      on july          u s  district judge claudia wilken in san francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time  the reason given for dismissal was that plaintiffs did not sufficiently document enough misrepresentations by apple for the trial to proceed       in march       the american civil liberties union expressed concern that siri was sending a large amount of personal voice and user information to apple  including the first name and nickname of the phone owner and his or her contacts  the owner s relationship with those contacts  personal labels assigned to email accounts  and the names of songs and playlists stored on the phone       siri and apple maps together were viewed as  flops  by the media in april               in october       scott forstall  apple s head of mobile software  and the leader held responsible for siri and the poorly received apple maps  was let go from apple           on october           google released a new google search app for ios  which featured an enhanced google voice search function and aimed to compete with siri    google s voice search was compared favorably to siri  with some reviewers preferring it  an apple fan blog side by side comparison said that google s voice search on ios is  amazingly quick and relevant  and has more depth than siri        according to sources from brazilian site techguru  nuance communications has delivered the final version in portuguese to apple  it also announced that the company would be making a deal with the bank bradesco to provide an application similar to siri for voice support       as of ios    siri has functionality to find local businesses and other location services outside of the united states  in siri s original release its functionality was limited in most countries  with maps and local search with help only being available within the united states     voice activated digital assistants  including siri  since the release of ios   and continuing with the latest release   have been shown to allow users to bypass ios security    as adam greenberg explains in sc magazine        the workaround only grants access to the phone app  but from there people can use the phone to dial anywhere they wish  listen to saved voicemails  view and change contact information  access photos  use twitter  login to email and shoot out texts      dany lisiansky demonstrated the bug in a youtube video  where he also posted step by step instructions on how to make it work  several users have taken to the comments section and twitter to confirm the exploit is genuine      moreover  whether an ios   or ios   device is locked or unlocked  siri can be used to switch it into airplane mode  to effectively disable the  find my iphone  or  find my ipad  apps     however  siri can be disabled on the lock screen in settings     in response  apple released ios        which patched the passcode bypass flaw as well as reintroduced the option to enter passwords via the greek alphabet keyboard  rather than just the four digit numerical option    however  as kashmir hill reported in a september      forbes article  the flaw continues in ios
