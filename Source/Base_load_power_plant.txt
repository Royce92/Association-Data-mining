 base load requirement  also baseload  is the minimum level of demand on an electrical supply system over    hours  base load power sources are those plants which can generate dependable power to consistently meet that minimum demand     historically large power grids have had base load power plant to exclusively meet the base load  there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so  the baseload can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of intermittent power sources and peaking power plant             baseload plant   also baseload power plant or base load power station  is an energy station devoted to the production of base load supply  baseload plants are the production facilities used to meet some or all of a given region s continuous energy demand  and produce energy at a constant rate  usually at a low cost relative to other production facilities available to the system   examples of baseload plants using nonrenewable fuels include nuclear and coal fired plants  among the renewable energy sources  hydroelectric  geothermal   biogas  biomass  solar thermal with storage and ocean thermal energy conversion can provide baseload power  baseload plants typically run at all times through the year except in the case of repairs or scheduled maintenance  hydroelectric power also has the desirable attribute of dispatchability  but a hydroelectric plant may run low on its fuel  water at the reservoir elevation  if a long drought occurs over its drainage basin     each baseload power plant on a grid is allotted a specific amount of the baseload power demand to handle  the base load power is determined by the load duration curve of the system  for a typical power system  the rule of thumb is that the base load power is usually        of the maximum load during the year citation needed    peaks or spikes in customer power demand are handled by smaller and more responsive types of power plants called peaking power plants  typically powered with gas turbines citation needed    whilst historically large power grids have had base load power plant to exclusively meet the base load  there is no specific technical requirement for this to be so  the baseload can equally well be met by the appropriate quantity of intermittent power sources and peaking power plant       power plants are designated baseload based on their low cost generation  efficiency and safety at rated output power levels  baseload power plants do not change production to match power consumption demands since it is more economical to operate them at constant production levels  use of higher cost combined cycle plants or combustion turbines is thus minimized  and these plants can be cycled up and down to match more rapid fluctuations in consumption  baseload generators  such as nuclear and coal  often have very high fixed costs  high plant load factor and very low marginal costs  on the other hand  peak load generators  such as natural gas  have low fixed costs  low plant load factor and high marginal costs   typically baseload plants are large and provide a majority of the power used by a grid  thus  they are more effective when used continuously to cover the power baseload required by the grid     nuclear power plants may take many hours  if not days  to change their power output   although modern stations  and those in france  can and do operate as load following power plants and alter their output to meet varying demands   nuclear and coal power plants have low fuel costs   because they require a long period of time to heat up to operating temperature  these plants typically handle large amounts of baseload demand  different plants and technologies may have differing capacities to increase or decrease output on demand  nuclear plants are generally run at close to maximum output continuously  apart from maintenance  refueling and periodic refurbishment   while coal fired plants may be cycled over the course of a day to meet demand citation needed plants with multiple generating units may be used as a group to improve the  fit  with demand  by operating each unit as close to peak efficiency as possible
