 a network switch  also called switching hub  bridging hub  officially mac bridge   is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network  by using packet switching to receive  process and forward data to the destination device  unlike less advanced network hubs  a network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it  rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports      a network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses hardware addresses to process and forward data at the data link layer  layer    of the osi model  switches can also process data at the network layer  layer    by additionally incorporating routing functionality that most commonly uses ip addresses to perform packet forwarding  such switches are commonly known as layer   switches or multilayer switches   beside most commonly used ethernet switches  they exist for various types of networks  including fibre channel  asynchronous transfer mode  and infiniband  the first ethernet switch was introduced by kalpana in                   a switch is a device used on a computer network to physically connect devices together  multiple cables can be connected to a switch to enable networked devices to communicate with each other  switches manage the flow of data across a network by only transmitting a received message to the device for which the message was intended  each networked device connected to a switch can be identified using a mac address  allowing the switch to regulate the flow of traffic  this maximises security and efficiency of the network     because of these features  a switch is often considered more  intelligent  than a network hub  hubs neither provide security  or identification of connected devices  this means that messages have to be transmitted out of every port of the hub  greatly degrading the efficiency of the network     an ethernet switch operates at the data link layer of the osi model to create a separate collision domain for each switch port  each computer connected to a switch port can transfer data to any of the other ones at a time  and the transmissions will not interferexa    with the limitation that  in half duplex mode  each line can only either receive from or transmit to its connected computer at a certain time  in full duplex mode  each line can simultaneously transmit and receive  regardless of the partner     in the case of using a repeater hub  only a single transmission could take place at a time for all ports combined  so they would all share the bandwidth and run in half duplex  necessary arbitration would also result in collisions requiring retransmissions     the network switch plays an integral part in most modern ethernet local area networks  lans   mid to large sized lans contain a number of linked managed switches  small office home office  soho  applications typically use a single switch  or an all purpose converged device such as a residential gateway to access small office home broadband services such as dsl or cable internet  in most of these cases  the end user device contains a router and components that interface to the particular physical broadband technology  user devices may also include a telephone interface for voice over ip  voip  protocol     segmentation is the use of a bridge or a switch  or a router  to split a larger collision domain into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability and improve overall throughput  in the extreme  i  e  microsegmentation  each device is located on a dedicated switch port  in contrast to an ethernet hub  there is a separate collision domain on each of the switch ports  this allows computers to have dedicated bandwidth on point to point connections to the network and also to run in full duplex without collisions  full duplex mode has only one transmitter and one receiver per  collision domain   making collisions impossible     switches may operate at one or more layers of the osi model  including the data link and network layers  a device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers is known as a multilayer switch     in switches intended for commercial use  built in or modular interfaces make it possible to connect different types of networks  including ethernet  fibre channel  rapidio  atm  itu t g hn and         this connectivity can be at any of the layers mentioned  while layer   functionality is adequate for bandwidth shifting within one technology  interconnecting technologies such as ethernet and token ring is easier at layer       devices that interconnect at layer   are traditionally called routers  so layer   switches can also be regarded as  relatively primitive  routers     where there is a need for a great deal of analysis of network performance and security  switches may be connected between wan routers as places for analytic modules  some vendors provide firewall    network intrusion detection   and performance analysis modules that can plug into switch ports  some of these functions may be on combined modules      in other cases  the switch is used to create a mirror image of data that can go to an external device  since most switch port mirroring provides only one mirrored stream  network hubs can be useful for fanning out data to several read only analyzers  such as intrusion detection systems and packet sniffers     while switches may learn about topologies at many layers  and forward at one or more layers  they do tend to have common features  other than for high performance applications  modern commercial switches use primarily ethernet interfaces     at any layer  a modern switch may implement power over ethernet  poe   which avoids the need for attached devices  such as a voip phone or wireless access point  to have a separate power supply  since switches can have redundant power circuits connected to uninterruptible power supplies  the connected device can continue operating even when regular office power fails     a network hub  or a repeater  is a simple network device that does not manage any of the traffic coming through it  any packet entering a port is flooded out or  repeated  on every other port  except for the port of entry  since every packet is repeated on every other port  packet collisions affect the entire network  limiting its overall capacity     a network switch creates the layer   end to end connection only virtually  while originally it was mandatory  the bridging function of a switch uses information taken from layer   to select for each packet the particular port s  it has to be forwarded to  removing the requirement that every node is presented with all traffic  as a result  the connection lines are not  switched  literally  instead they only appear that way on the packet level     there are specialized applications in which a network hub can be useful  such as copying traffic to multiple network sensors  high end network switches usually have a feature called port mirroring that provides the same functionality     by the early     s  there was little price difference between a hub and a low end switch      a network bridge  operating at the data link layer  may interconnect a small number of devices in a home or the office  this is a trivial case of bridging  in which the bridge learns the mac address of each connected device     single bridges also can provide extremely high performance in specialized applications such as storage area networks     classic bridges may also interconnect using a spanning tree protocol that disables links so that the resulting local area network is a tree without loops  in contrast to routers  spanning tree bridges must have topologies with only one active path between two points  the older ieee      d spanning tree protocol could be quite slow  with forwarding stopping for    seconds while the spanning tree reconverged  a rapid spanning tree protocol was introduced as ieee      w  the newest standard shortest path bridging  ieee      aq  is the next logical progression and incorporates all the older spanning tree protocols  ieee      d stp  ieee      w rstp  ieee      s mstp  that blocked traffic on all but one alternative path  ieee      aq  shortest path bridging spb  allows all paths to be active with multiple equal cost paths  provides much larger layer   topologies  up to    million compared to the      vlans limit     faster convergence  and improves the use of the mesh topologies through increase bandwidth and redundancy between all devices by allowing traffic to load share across all paths of a mesh network             while layer   switch remains more of a marketing term than a technical term citation needed the products that were introduced as  switches  tended to use microsegmentation and full duplex to prevent collisions among devices connected to ethernet  by using an internal forwarding plane much faster than any interface  they give the impression of simultaneous paths among multiple devices   non blocking  devices use a forwarding plane or equivalent method fast enough to allow full duplex traffic for each port simultaneously     once a bridge learns the addresses of its connected nodes  it forwards data link layer frames using a layer   forwarding method  there are four forwarding methods a bridge can use  of which the second through fourth method were performance increasing methods when used on  switch  products with the same input and output port bandwidths     while there are specialized applications  such as storage area networks  where the input and output interfaces are the same bandwidth  this is not always the case in general lan applications  in lans  a switch used for end user access typically concentrates lower bandwidth and uplinks into a higher bandwidth     within the confines of the ethernet physical layer  a layer   switch can perform some or all of the functions normally performed by a router  the most common layer   capability is awareness of ip multicast through igmp snooping  with this awareness  a layer   switch can increase efficiency by delivering the traffic of a multicast group only to ports where the attached device has signaled that it wants to listen to that group     while the exact meaning of the term layer   switch is vendor dependent  it almost always starts with a capability for network address translation  but then adds some type of load distribution based on tcp sessions       the device may include a stateful firewall  a vpn concentrator  or be an ipsec security gateway     layer   switches may distribute loads based on uniform resource locator url or by some installation specific technique to recognize application level transactions  a layer   switch may include a web cache and participate in a content delivery network       unless port mirroring or other methods such as rmon  smon or sflow are implemented in a switch    it is difficult to monitor traffic that is bridged using a switch because only the sending and receiving ports can see the traffic  these monitoring features are rarely present on consumer grade switches     two popular methods that are specifically designed to allow a network analyst to monitor traffic are     another method to monitor may be to connect a layer   hub between the monitored device and its switch port  this will induce minor delay  but will provide multiple interfaces that can be used to monitor the individual switch port
