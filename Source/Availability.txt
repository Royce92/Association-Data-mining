 in reliability theory and reliability engineering  the term availability has the following meanings     for example  a unit that is capable of being used     hours per week      hours  would have an availability of          however  typical availability values are specified in decimal  such as          in high availability applications  a metric known as nines  corresponding to the number of nines following the decimal point  is used  with this convention   five nines  equals          or          availability             availability of a system is typically measured as a factor of its reliability   as reliability increases  so does availability  availability of a system may also be increased by the strategy on focusing on increasing testability   maintainability and not on reliability  improving maintainability is generally easier than reliability  maintainability estimates  repair rates  are also generally more accurate  however  because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large  it is likely to dominate the availability  prediction uncertainty  problem  even while maintainability levels are very high     when reliability is not under control more complicated issues may arise  like manpower  maintainers   customer service capability  shortage  spare part availability  logistic delays  lack of repair facilities  extensive retro fit and complex configuration management costs and others  the problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the  domino effect  of maintenance induced failures after repairs  only focusing on maintainability is therefore not enough  if failures are prevented  none of the others are of any importance and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important part of availability     reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the cost of ownership  due to cost of spare parts  maintenance man hours  transport costs  storage cost  part obsolete risks etc    often a trade off is needed between the two  there might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership  testability of a system should also be addressed in the availability plan as this is the link between reliability and maintainability  the maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system  e g  by preventive and or predictive maintenance   although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability  so  maintainability and maintenance strategies influences the availability of a system  in theory this can be almost unlimited if one would be able to always repair any fault in an infinitely short time  this is in practice impossible  repair ability is always limited due to testability  manpower and logistic considerations     an availability plan should clearly provide a strategy for availability control  whether only availability or also cost of ownership is more important depends on the use of the system  for example  a system that is a critical link in a production system   e g  a big oil platform   is normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if this translates to even a minor increase in availability  as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership  a proper reliability plan should always address ramt analysis in its total context  ramt stands in this case for reliability  availability  maintainability maintenance and testability in context to the customer needs     the most simple representation for availability is as a ratio of the expected value of the uptime of a system to the aggregate of the expected values of up and down time  or    if we define the status function  as    therefore  the availability a t  at time t   is represented by    average availability must be defined on an interval of the real line  if we consider an arbitrary constant   then average availability is represented as    limiting  or steady state  availability is represented bycitation needed    limiting average availability is also defined on an interval  as     availability is the probability that an item will be in an operable and commitable state at the start of a mission when the mission is called for at a random time  and is generally defined as uptime divided by total time  uptime plus downtime      availability  inherent  ai    the probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment  it excludes logistics time  waiting or administrative downtime  and preventive maintenance downtime  it includes corrective maintenance downtime  inherent availability is generally derived from analysis of an engineering design and is calculated as the mean time to failure  mttf  divided by the mean time to failure plus the mean time to repair  mttr   it is based on quantities under control of the designer     availability  achieved  aa    the probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used under stated conditions in an ideal support environment  i e   that personnel  tools  spares  etc  are instantaneously available   it excludes logistics time and waiting or administrative downtime  it includes active preventive and corrective maintenance downtime     availability  operational  ao    the probability that an item will operate satisfactorily at a given point in time when used in an actual or realistic operating and support environment  it includes logistics time  ready time  and waiting or administrative downtime  and both preventive and corrective maintenance downtime  this value is equal to the mean time between failure  mtbf  divided by the mean time between failure plus the mean downtime  mdt   this measure extends the definition of availability to elements controlled by the logisticians and mission planners such as quantity and proximity of spares  tools and manpower to the hardware item     nrefer to systems engineering for more details    if we are using equipment which has a mean time to failure  mttf  of      years and mean time to repair  mttr  of   hour     mttf in hours                       this is a reliability parameter and often has a high level of uncertainty      inherent availability  ai    mttf  mttf mttr                                 inherent unavailability                outage due to equipment in hours per year     rate     mttf           hours per year     availability is well established in the literature of stochastic modeling and optimal maintenance  barlow and proschan      define availability of a repairable system as  the probability that the system is operating at a specified time t   blanchard      gives a qualitative definition of availability as  a measure of the degree of a system which is in the operable and committable state at the start of mission when the mission is called for at an unknown random point in time   this definition comes from the mil std      lie  hwang  and tillman      developed a complete survey along with a systematic classification of availability     availability measures are classified by either the time interval of interest or the mechanisms for the system downtime  if the time interval of interest is the primary concern  we consider instantaneous  limiting  average  and limiting average availability  the aforementioned definitions are developed in barlow and proschan       lie  hwang  and tillman       and nachlas       the second primary classification for availability is contingent on the various mechanisms for downtime such as the inherent availability  achieved availability  and operational availability   blanchard       lie  hwang  and tillman        mi      gives some comparison results of availability considering inherent availability     availability considered in maintenance modeling can be found in barlow and proschan      for replacement models  fawzi and hawkes      for an r out of n system with spares and repairs  fawzi and hawkes      for a series system with replacement and repair  iyer      for imperfect repair models  murdock      for age replacement preventive maintenance models  nachlas            for preventive maintenance models  and wang and pham      for imperfect maintenance models     availability is used extensively in power plant engineering  for example  the north american electric reliability corporation implemented the generating availability data system in           xa this
