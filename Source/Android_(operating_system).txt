 android is a mobile operating system  os  based on the linux kernel and currently developed by google  with a user interface based on direct manipulation  android is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers  with specialized user interfaces for televisions  android tv   cars  android auto   and wrist watches  android wear   the os uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real world actions  like swiping  tapping  pinching  and reverse pinching to manipulate on screen objects  and a virtual keyboard  despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input  it also has been used in game consoles  digital cameras  regular pcs  e g  the hp slate     and other electronics     as of july     update  the google play store has had over one million android applications   apps   published  and over    billion applications downloaded    a developer survey conducted in april may      found that     of mobile developers develop for android    at google i o       the company revealed that there were over one billion active monthly android users  up from     million in june         as of     update  android has the largest installed base of all general purpose operating systems     android s source code is released by google under open source licenses  although most android devices ultimately ship with a combination of open source and proprietary software  including proprietary software developed and licensed by google   initially developed by android  inc   which google backed financially and later bought in         android was unveiled in       along with the founding of the open handset alliance u   ba consortium of hardware  software  and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices       android is popular with technology companies which require a ready made  low cost and customizable operating system for high tech devices    android s open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open source code as a foundation for community driven projects  which add new features for advanced users   or bring android to devices which were officially released running other operating systems  the operating system s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so called  smartphone wars  between technology companies                 android  inc  was founded in palo alto  california in october      by andy rubin  co founder of danger     rich miner  co founder of wildfire communications  inc      nick sears  once vp at t mobile     and chris white  headed design and interface development at webtv    to develop  in rubin s words   smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner s location and preferences     the early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras  though  when it was realized that the market for the devices was not large enough  the company diverted its efforts toward producing a smartphone operating system that would rival symbian and microsoft windows mobile    despite the past accomplishments of the founders and early employees  android inc  operated secretly  revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones    that same year  rubin ran out of money  steve perlman  a close friend of rubin  brought him         in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company       google acquired android inc  on august           key employees of android inc   including rubin  miner  and white  stayed at the company after the acquisition    not much was known about android inc  at the time  but many assumed that google was planning to enter the mobile phone market with this move    at google  the team led by rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the linux kernel  google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing a flexible  upgradable system  google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part           speculation about google s intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through december         an earlier prototype codenamed  sooner  had a closer resemblance to a blackberry phone  with no touchscreen  and a physical  qwerty keyboard  but was later re engineered to support a touchscreen  to compete with other announced devices such as the      lg prada and      apple iphone      in september       informationweek covered an evalueserve study reporting that google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony         on november          the open handset alliance  a consortium of technology companies including google  device manufacturers such as htc  sony and samsung  wireless carriers such as sprint nextel and t mobile  and chipset makers such as qualcomm and texas instruments  unveiled itself  with a goal to develop open standards for mobile devices    that day  android was unveiled as its first product  a mobile device platform built on the linux kernel version             the first commercially available smartphone running android was the htc dream  released on october                in       google launched its nexus series of devicesxa    a line of smartphones and tablets running the android operating system  and built by manufacturing partners  htc collaborated with google to release the first nexus smartphone    the nexus one  google has since updated the series with newer devices  such as the nexusxa   phone  made by lg  and the nexusxa   tablet  made by asus   google releases the nexus phones and tablets to act as their flagship android devices  demonstrating android s latest software and hardware features  until january       google offered several google play edition devices over google play  as google customized android phones and tablets that  while not carrying the google nexus branding  run an unmodified version of android     on march          larry page announced in a blog post that andy rubin had moved from the android division to take on new projects at google    he was replaced by sundar pichai  who also continues his role as the head of google s chrome division    which develops chrome os     since       android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system  adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases  each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat  for example  version      cupcake  was followed by      donut   version        kitkat  appeared as a security only update  it was released on june           shortly after       was released      android      lollipop  was released on november           introducing  material design  as a new design language and one if its key new features  it was followed by two bugfix releases        and               in       google launched android one  a standardized smartphone  mainly targeting customers in the developing world  android one smartphones running the latest version of android  e g  the latest android      close to the stock version of the operating system  as of march        update  the newest version of the android operating system       is available for selected devices including the android one series  the nexus   phablet  and the nexus   tablet       from      to       hugo barra served as product spokesperson for the android team  representing android at both press conferences and google i o  google s annual developer focused conference  barra s product involvement included the entire android ecosystem of software and hardware  including honeycomb  ice cream sandwich  jelly bean and kitkat operating system launches  the nexus   and nexus   smartphones  the nexus     and nexus    tablets    and other related products such as google now   and google voice search  google s speech recognition product comparable to apple s siri    in       barra left the android team for chinese smartphone maker xiaomi       android s default user interface is based on direct manipulation    using touch inputs  that loosely correspond to real world actions  like swiping  tapping  pinching  and reverse pinching to manipulate on screen objects  and a virtual keyboard    the response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface  often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user  internal hardware such as accelerometers  gyroscopes and proximity sensors   are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions  for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented  or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device  simulating control of a steering wheel       android devices boot to the homescreen  the primary navigation and information point on the device  which is similar to the desktop found on pcs  android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets  app icons launch the associated app  whereas widgets display live  auto updating content such as the weather forecast  the user s email inbox  or a news ticker directly on the homescreen    a homescreen may be made up of several pages that the user can swipe back and forth between  though android s homescreen interface is heavily customisable  allowing the user to adjust the look and feel of the device to their tastes    third party apps available on google play and other app stores can extensively re theme the homescreen  and even mimic the look of other operating systems  such as windows phone    most manufacturers  and some wireless carriers  customise the look and feel of their android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors       present along the top of the screen is a status bar  showing information about the device and its connectivity  this status bar can be  pulled  down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates  such as a newly received email or sms text  in a way that does not immediately interrupt or inconvenience the user    notifications are persistent until read  by tapping  which opens the relevant app  or dismissed by sliding it off the screen  beginning on android       expanded notifications  can display expanded details or additional functionality  for instance  a music player can display playback controls  and a  missed call  notification provides buttons for calling back or sending the caller an sms message       android provides the ability to run applications which change the default launcher and hence the appearance and externally visible behaviour of android  these appearance changes include a multi page dock or no dock  and many more changes to fundamental features of the user interface       applications   apps    that extend the functionality of devices  are written primarily in the java programming language    without the usual  write once  run anywhere  claim of the java platform  using the android software development kit  sdk   the sdk includes a comprehensive set of development tools    including a debugger  software libraries  a handset emulator based on qemu  documentation  sample code  and tutorials  the officially supported integrated development environment  ide  is eclipse using the android development tools  adt  plugin  other development tools are available  including a native development kit for applications or extensions in c or c    google app inventor  a visual environment for novice programmers  and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks  in january       google unveiled an apache cordova based framework for porting chrome html   applications to android  wrapped in a native application shell       android has a growing selection of third party applications  which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application s apk file  or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install  update  and remove applications from their devices  google play store is the primary application store installed on android devices that comply with google s compatibility requirements and license the google mobile services software     google play store allows users to browse  download and update applications published by google and third party developers  as of july     update  there are more than one million applications available for android in play store    as of may     update     billion applications have been installed from google play store   and in july          billion applications were installed      some carriers offer direct carrier billing for google play application purchases  where the cost of the application is added to the user s monthly bill       due to the open nature of android  a number of third party application marketplace also exist for android  either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with google play store  provide applications that cannot be offered on google play store due to policy violations  or for other reasons  examples of these third party stores have included the amazon appstore  getjar  and slideme  f droid  another alternative marketplace  seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses            since android devices are usually battery powered  android is designed to manage memory  ram  to keep power consumption at a minimum  in contrast to desktop operating systems which generally assume they are connected to unlimited mains electricity  when an android application is no longer in use  the system will automatically suspend it in memory  while the application is still technically  open   suspended applications consume no resources  for example  battery power or processing power  and sit idly in the background until needed again  this brings a dual benefit by increasing the general responsiveness of android devices  since applications do not need to be closed and reopened from scratch each time  and by ensuring that background applications do not consume power needlessly         android manages the applications stored in memory automatically  when memory is low  the system will begin killing applications and processes that have been inactive for a while  in reverse order since they were last used  oldest first   this process is designed to be invisible to the user  so that users do not need to manage memory or the killing of applications themselves      as of       third party task killers were reported by lifehacker as doing more harm than good       the main hardware platform for android is the arm architecture  armv  and armv  a architectures   with x   and mips architectures also officially supported  the latter two became officially supported in later android versions   since androidxa      lollipop      bit variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the    bit variants    unofficial android x   project used to provide support for the x   and mips architectures ahead of the official support     since       android devices with intel processors began to appear  including phones   and tablets  while gaining support for    bit platforms  android was first made to run on    bit x   and then on arm       as of november     update  android     recommends at least    xa mb of ram    while for  low ram  devices    xa mb is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the baseband processor    android     requires a    bit armv   mips or x   architecture processor  latter two through unofficial ports      together with an opengl es     compatible graphics processing unit  gpu     android supports opengl es               and      some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the opengl es  and suitable gpu hardware is required to run such applications       android devices incorporate many optional hardware components  including still or video cameras  gps  orientation sensors  dedicated gaming controls  accelerometers  gyroscopes  barometers  magnetometers  proximity sensors  pressure sensors  thermometers  and touchscreens  some hardware components are not required  but became standard in certain classes of devices  such as smartphones  and additional requirements apply if they are present  some other hardware was initially required  but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether  for example  as android was developed initially as a phone os  hardware such as microphones were required  while over time the phone function became optional    android used to require an autofocus camera  which was relaxed to a fixed focus camera   if it is even present at all  since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when android started to be used on set top boxes     in addition to running on smartphones and tablets  several vendors run android natively on regular pc hardware with a keyboard and mouse        in addition to their availability on commercially available hardware  similar pc hardware friendly versions of android are freely available from the android x   project  including customized androidxa        using the android emulator that is part of the android sdk  or by using bluestacks or andy  android can also run non natively on x        chinese companies are building a pc and mobile operating system  based on android  to  compete directly with microsoft windows and google android     the chinese academy of engineering noted that  more than a dozen  companies were customising android following a chinese ban on the use of windows   on government pcs           android is developed in private by google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released  at which point the source code is made available publicly    this source code will only run without modification on select devices  usually the nexus series of devices  the source code is  in turn  adapted by oems to run on their hardware    android s source code does not contain the often proprietary device drivers that are needed for certain hardware components       the green android logo was designed for google in      by graphic designer irina blok  the design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design  after numerous design developments based on science fiction and space movies  the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape  as android is open sourced  it was agreed that the logo should be likewise  and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design       google provides major incremental upgrades to android every six to nine months  with confectionery themed names  which most devices are capable of receiving over the air    the latest major release is android      lollipop        compared to its chief rival mobile operating system  namely ios  android updates are typically slow to reach actual devices  for devices not under the nexus brand  updates often arrive months from the time the given version is officially released    this is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware of android devices  to which each upgrade must be specifically tailored  as the official google source code only runs on their flagship nexus devices  porting android to specific hardware is a time  and resource consuming process for device manufacturers  who prioritize their newest devices and often leave older ones behind    hence  older smartphones are frequently not updated if the manufacturer decides it is not worth their time  regardless of whether the phone is capable of running the update  this problem is compounded when manufacturers customize android with their own interface and apps  which must be reapplied to each new release  additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who  after receiving updates from manufacturers  further customize and brand android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users       the lack of after sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media      some commentators have noted that the industry has a financial incentive not to upgrade their devices  as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones    an attitude described as  insulting     the guardian has complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way    in       google partnered with a number of industry players to announce an  android update alliance   pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for    months after its release    however  there has not been another official word about that alliance          in       google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system  particularly core applications  so they could be updated through google play store  independently of android itself  one of these components  google play services  is a closed source system level process providing apis for google services  installed automatically on nearly all devices running android version     and higher  with these changes  google can add new operating system functionality through play services and application updates without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself  as a result  android     and     contained relatively fewer user facing changes  focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements         android s kernel is based on one of the linux kernel s long term support  lts  branches  since april       android devices mainly use versions     or      of the linux kernel        the specific kernel version depends on the actual android device and its hardware platform           android has used various kernel versions since the version        that was used in androidxa           android s variant of the linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by google outside the typical linux kernel development cycle  such as the inclusion of components like binder  ashmem  pmem  logger  wakelocks  and different out of memory  oom  handling           certain features that google contributed back to the linux kernel  notably a power management feature called  wakelocks   were rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that google did not show any intent to maintain its own code           google announced in april      that they would hire two employees to work with the linux kernel community     but greg kroah hartman  the current linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch  said in december      that he was concerned that google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream linux     some google android developers hinted that  the android team was getting fed up with the process   because they were a small team and had more urgent work to do on android        in august       linus torvalds said that  eventually android and linux would come back to a common kernel  but it will probably not be for four to five years      in december       greg kroah hartman announced the start of android mainlining project  which aims to put some android drivers  patches and features back into the linux kernel  starting in linux         linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the     kernel  after many previous attempts at merger  the interfaces are the same but the upstream linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes  to memory  the traditional suspend that android uses   and to disk  hibernate  as it is known on the desktop      google maintains a public code repository that contains their experimental work to re base android off the latest stable linux versions           the flash storage on android devices is split into several partitions  such as  system for the operating system itself  and  data for user data and application installations     in contrast to desktop linux distributions  android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as  system are read only  however  root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in android  which is used frequently by the open source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices     but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware        android is a linux distribution according to the linux foundation     google s open source chief chris dibona     and several journalists        others  such as google engineer patrick brady  say that android is not linux in the traditional unix like linux distribution sense  android does not include the gnu c library  it uses bionic as an alternative c library  and some of other components typically found in linux distributions        on top of the linux kernel  there are the middleware  libraries and apis written in c  and application software running on an application framework which includes java compatible libraries based on apache harmony  development of the linux kernel continues independently of other android s source code bases     until version      android used dalvik as a process virtual machine with trace based just in time  jit  compilation to run dalvik  dex code   dalvik executable   which is usually translated from the java bytecode  following the trace based jit principle  in addition to interpreting the majority of application code  dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments   traces   each time an application is launched           androidxa     introduced android runtime  art  as a new runtime environment  which uses ahead of time  aot  compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application  in androidxa      art was an experimental feature and not enabled by default  it became the only runtime option in the next major version of android             android s standard c library  bionic  was developed by google specifically for android  as a derivation of the bsd s standard c library code  bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the linux kernel  the main benefits of using bionic instead of the gnu c library  glibc  or uclibc are its smaller runtime footprint  and optimization for low frequency cpus  at the same time  bionic is licensed under the terms of bsd licence  which google finds more suitable for the android s overall licensing model        aiming for a different licensing model  toward the end of      google switched the bluetooth stack in android from the gpl licensed bluez to the apache licensed bluedroid        android does not have a native x window system by default  nor does it support the full set of standard gnu libraries  this made it difficult to port existing linux applications or libraries to android     until version r  of the android native development kit brought support for applications written completely in c or c       libraries written in c may also be used in applications by injection of a small shim and usage of the jni        android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the android open source project  aosp  source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system     these community developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer carrier channels  albeit without as extensive testing or quality assurance    provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates  or bring android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems  such as the hp touchpad  community releases often come pre rooted and contain modifications unsuitable for non technical users  such as the ability to overclock or over undervolt the device s processor     cyanogenmod is the most widely used community firmware     and acts as a foundation for numerous others     historically  device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third party firmware development  manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this     moreover  modified firmwares such as cyanogenmod sometimes offer features  such as tethering  for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium  as a result  technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices  however  as community developed software has grown more popular  and following a statement by the librarian of congress in the united states that permits the  jailbreaking  of mobile devices     manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development  with some  including htc     motorola     samsung       and sony     providing support and encouraging development  as a result of this  over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders  similar to nexus series of phones  although usually requiring that users waive their devices  warranties to do so     however  despite manufacturer acceptance  some carriers in the us still require that phones are locked down  frustrating developers and customers           android applications run in a sandbox  an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system s resources  unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed  before installing an application  play store displays all required permissions  a game may need to enable vibration or save data to an sd card  for example  but should not need to read sms messages or access the phonebook  after reviewing these permissions  the user can choose to accept or refuse them  installing the application only if they accept     the sandboxing and permissions system lessens the impact of vulnerabilities and bugs in applications  but developer confusion and limited documentation has resulted in applications routinely requesting unnecessary permissions  reducing its effectiveness     google has now pushed an update to android verify apps feature  which will now run in background to detect malicious processes and crack them down        the  app ops  privacy and application permissions control system  used for internal development and testing by google  was introduced in google s android     release for the nexus devices  initially hidden  the feature was discovered publicly  it allowed users to install a management application and approve or deny permission requests individually for each of the applications installed on a device     access to the app ops was later restricted by google starting with android       with an explanation that the feature was accidentally enabled and not intended for end users  for such a decision  google received criticism from the electronic frontier foundation           individual application permissions management  through the app ops or third party tools  is currently only possible with root access to the device           research from security company trend micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of android malware  where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user     other malware displays unwanted and intrusive adverts on the device  or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties     security threats on android are reportedly growing exponentially  however  google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons        and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users     google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare     and a survey conducted by f secure showed that only      of android malware reported had come from the google play store        google currently uses google bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan the google play store apps     it is intended to flag up suspicious apps and warn users of any potential threat with an application before they download it     android version     jelly bean was released in      with enhanced security features  including a malware scanner built into the system  which works in combination with google play but can scan apps installed from third party sources as well  and an alert system which notifies the user when an app tries to send a premium rate text message  blocking the message unless the user explicitly authorises it     several security firms  such as lookout mobile security     avg technologies     and mcafee     have released antivirus software for android devices  this software is ineffective as sandboxing also applies to such applications  limiting their ability to scan the deeper system for threats           android smartphones have the ability to report the location of wi fi access points  encountered as phone users move around  to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points  these databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones  allowing them to run apps like foursquare  google latitude  facebook places  and to deliver location based ads     third party monitoring software such as taintdroid     an academic research funded project  can  in some cases  detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers     in august       google released android device manager  adm   a component that allows users to remotely track  locate  and wipe their android device through a web interface        in december       google released adm as an android application on the google play store  where it is available to devices running android version     and higher           the open source nature of android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses  for example samsung has worked with general dynamics through their open kernel labs acquisition to rebuild jelly bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the  knox  project           as part of the broader      mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in september      that the american and british intelligence agencies  the national security agency  nsa  and government communications headquarters  gchq   respectively  have access to the user data on iphone  blackberry  and android devices  they are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information  including sms  location  emails  and notes     in january       further reports revealed the intelligence agencies  capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the internet by social networks and other popular applications such as angry birds  which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons  gchq has  according to the guardian  a wiki style guide of different apps and advertising networks  and the different data that can be siphoned from each     later that week  the finnish angry birds developer rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations  and called upon the wider industry to do the same        the documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept google maps searches and queries submitted from android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk     the nsa and gchq insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws  although the guardian stated  the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information  especially for those outside the us  who enjoy fewer privacy protections than americans         the source code for android is open source  it is developed in private by google  with the source code released publicly when a new version of android is released  google publishes most of the code  including network and telephony stacks  under the non copyleft apache license version      which allows modification and redistribution        the license does not grant rights to the  android  trademark  so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from google under individual contracts  associated linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft gnu general public license version    developed by the open handset alliance  with the source code publicly available at all times  typically  google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device  part of the nexus series  featuring the new version of android  then makes the source code available after that device has been released     the only android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet only     honeycomb release  the reason  according to andy rubin in an official android blog post  was because honeycomb was rushed for production of the motorola xoom     and they did not want third parties creating a  really bad user experience  by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of android intended for tablets        while all of android itself is open source software  most android devices ship with a large amount of proprietary software  such as google mobile services  which includes apps such as google play store  google search  and google play services a software layer which provides apis that integrate with google provided services  among others  these apps must be licensed from google by device makers  and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements       custom  certified distributions of android produced by manufacturers  such as touchwiz and htc sense  may also replace certain stock android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock android operating system   there may also be  binary blob  drivers required for certain hardware components in the device        several stock apps in android s open source code used by previous versions  such as search  music  and calendar  have also been effectively deprecated by google  with development having shifted to newer but proprietary versions distributed and updated through play store  such as google search and google play music  while these older apps remain in android s source code  they have no longer received any major updates  additionally  proprietary variants of the stock camera and gallery apps also include certain functions  such as photosphere panoramas and google  album integration  that are excluded from open source versions  however  they have yet to be completely abandoned   similarly  the nexus   uses a non free variation of android     s home screen that is embedded directly within the google search app  adding voice activated search and the ability to access google now as a page on the home screen itself  although an update for google search app containing the relevant components was released through google play for all android devices  the new home screen required an additional stub application to function  and was not provided in android     updates for any other devices  which still used the existing home screen from android version       the stub application was officially released on play store as google now launcher in february       initially for nexus and google play edition devices with android version                   richard stallman and the free software foundation have been critical of android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as replicant  because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of android devices are usually proprietary  and because google play can forcibly install or deinstall apps and invites non free software           google licenses their google mobile services software  along with android trademarks  only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet google s compatibility standards specified in the android compatibility program document     thus  forks of android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of google s non free components  stay incompatible with applications that require them  and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of google play store   examples of such android forks are the amazon s fire os  which is used on the kindle fire line of tablets  and oriented toward amazon services   the nokia x software platform  a fork used by the nokia x family  oriented primarily toward nokia and microsoft services   and other forks that exclude google apps due to the general unavailability of google service in that country and licensing fees  such as in china         in       google also began to require that all android devices which license the google mobile services software display a prominent  powered by android  logo on their boot screens       members of the open handset alliance  which include the majority of android oems  are also contractually forbidden from producing android devices based on forks of the os      in       acer inc  was forced by google to halt production on a device powered by alibaba group s aliyun os with threats of removal from the oha  as google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of android  alibaba group defended the allegations  arguing that the os was a distinct platform from android  primarily using html  apps   but incorporated portions of android s platform to allow backwards compatibility with third party android software  indeed  the devices did ship with an application store which offered android apps  however  the majority of them were pirated              android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in       although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with google to form the open handset alliance  it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with android     the idea of an open source  linux based development platform sparked interest     but there were additional worries about android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market  such as nokia and microsoft  and rival linux mobile operating systems that were in development     these established players were skeptical  nokia was quoted as saying  we don t see this as a threat      and a member of microsoft s windows mobile team stated  i don t understand the impact that they are going to have         since then android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system      and  one of the fastest mobile experiences available      reviewers have highlighted the open source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths  allowing companies such as nokia  nokia x family      amazon  kindle fire   barnes   noble  nook   ouya  baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of android  as a result  it has been described by technology website ars technica as  practically the default operating system for launching new hardware  for companies without their own mobile platforms    this openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user  android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non google app stores and third party websites  these have been cited as among the main advantages of android phones over others          despite android s popularity  including an activation rate three times that of ios  there have been reports that google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn android into the money maker that analysts had expected     the verge suggested that google is losing control of android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non google apps and services amazon s kindle fire line uses fire os  a heavily modified fork of android which does not include or support any of google s proprietary components  and requires that users obtain software from its competing amazon appstore instead of play store   in       in an effort to improve prominence of the android brand  google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an android logo on the boot screen       android has suffered from  fragmentation      a situation where the variety of android devices  in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them  makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as ios where hardware and software varies less  for example  according to data from opensignal in july       there were        models of android device  numerous different screen sizes and eight android os versions simultaneously in use  while the large majority of ios users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that os     critics such as apple insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed android s growth through large volumes of low end  budget priced devices running older versions of android  they maintain this forces android developers to write for the  lowest common denominator  to reach as many users as possible  who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices     however  opensignal  who develops both android and ios apps  concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier  android s wider global reach also increases the potential reward        research company canalys estimated in the second quarter of      that android had a      share of worldwide smartphone shipments     by the fourth quarter of      this had grown to     of the market  becoming the top selling smartphone platform     overtaking symbian     by the third quarter of      gartner estimated that more than half         of the smartphone sales belonged to android     by the third quarter of      android had a     share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm idc        in july       google said that         new android devices were being activated every day     up from         per day in may     and more than     million devices had been activated    with      growth per week     in september           million devices had been activated with     million activations per day        in may       at google i o  sundar pichai announced that     million android devices had been activated        android market share varies by location  in july        mobile subscribers aged      in the united states using android were up to         and rose to     in china     during the third quarter of       android s worldwide smartphone shipment market share was         with     million devices activated in total  in april      android had     million activations per day     as of may     update     billion applications   apps   have been installed from the google play store    and by september       one billion android devices have been activated        as of july     update  the google play store has had over one million android applications published  and over    billion applications downloaded    a developer survey conducted in april may      found that android is used by     of mobile developers    the operating system s success has made it a target for patent litigation as part of the so called  smartphone wars  between technology companies         android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets  including the us  while  only in japan was apple on top   september november      numbers      at the end of       over     billion android smartphones have been sold in the four years since             making android the most sold phone and tablet os  three billion android smartphones are estimated to be sold by the end of       including previous years   according to gartner research company  android based devices outsold all contenders  every year since          in       it outsold windows       or by     million           android has the largest installed base of all general purpose operating systems  as of     update  devices running it also sell more than windows  ios and mac osxa x devices combined     since july       android is the most popular mobile operating system when it comes to use for web browsing  according to netapplications     in india and other countries  android is the most popular operating system overall  not just counting the  mobile  ones  for web browsing usage  according to statcounter   mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including india  south africa and saudi arabia      with several countries in africa having done so already  including ethiopia and kenya in which mobile usage is at               while android phones in the west commonly include google s proprietary add ons  such as google play  to the otherwise open source operating system  increasingly this is not done in emerging markets   abi research claims that    million devices shipped globally with open source android in the second quarter of       up from    million in the first quarter   depending on country  percent of phones estimated to be based only on android s source code  aosp   forgoing the android trademark  thailand        philippines        indonesia        india        malaysia        mexico        brazil             according to gartner   android surpassed a billion shipments of devices in       and will continue to grow at a double digit pace in       with a    percent increase year over year   this makes it the first time that any general purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within a year  by reaching close to      billion end users in       android shipped over four times more than ios and osxa x combined  and over three times more than microsoft windows  gartner expects the whole mobile phone market to  reach two billion units in        including android        by statistica s estimate  android smartphones have an installed base  in       of      million androids smartphones      of the estimated     billion         to put the statistica s numbers in context  by strategy analytics estimates  windows the most popular  desktop  operating system  has an estimated installed base of about      million at best     they also estimate the overall tablet installed base to be already of comparable size to the pc market and predict tablets will have surpassed them by       most of the tablet installed base consists of androids that add to the above android smartphone numbers b    despite its success on smartphones  initially android tablet adoption was slow     one of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications  but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them        the content and app  ecosystem  proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets  due to the lack of android tablet specific applications in       early android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill suited to larger screen sizes  whereas the dominance of apple s ipad was reinforced by the large number of tablet specific ios applications           despite app support in its infancy  a considerable number of android tablets  alongside those using other operating systems  such as the hp touchpad and blackberry playbook  were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the ipad     infoworld has suggested that some android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a  frankenphone business   a short term low investment opportunity by placing a smartphone optimized android os  before android     honeycomb for tablets was available  on a device while neglecting user interface  this approach  such as with the dell streak  failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of android tablets        furthermore  several android tablets such as the motorola xoom were priced the same or higher than the ipad  which hurt sales  an exception was the amazon kindle fire  which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to amazon s ecosystem of applications and content           this began to change in      with the release of the affordable nexus   and a push by google for developers to write better tablet applications     according to international data corporation  shipments of android powered tablets surpassed ipads in q              as of the end of       over       million android tablets had sold in three years since             this made android tablets the most sold type of tablet in       surpassing ipads in the second quarter of             as of march     update  according to statcounter and by accounting android tablets accessing the web u   ba proxy for their installed base u   bthey are catching up to the ipad in big countries and continents such as south america  having done so already in russia           india              indonesia              and the whole africa           china is a major exception for big developing countries  in which android phablets are however much more popular than android tablets or ipads  while similar devices get classified as smartphones     android comes preinstalled on some laptops and can also be installed on most personal computers by end users  one reviewer commented     you can even alt tab between running applications  something you don t really notice until you use android on a laptop or desktop     the notification center is vastly more complete and robust than in most environments  just about every type of notification comes through this one user interface  functionality that other desktops only dream of        if one can get over the whole  every app runs full screen  shebang  android actually makes for an astoundingly usable  easy to learn  fairly peppy and relatively good looking desktop environment     would i enjoy the android user experience as my primary linux desktop experience  yes  absolutely  in fact  for long periods of time  android has been my primary computing platform  and the environment is absolutely usable for that purpose      bryan lunduke  network world       bryan also notes that  photoshop for android tablets    runs remarkably well on an android laptop                         charts in this section provide breakdowns of android versions  based on the devices accessing the play store in a seven day period ending on march            c therefore  these statistics exclude android forks that do not access google play  such as amazon s fire tablets     in general  paid android applications can easily be pirated     in a may      interview with eurogamer  the developers of football manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was     for their game football manager handheld     however  not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue  for example  in july      the developers of the game wind up knight said that piracy levels of their game were only      and most of the piracy came from china  where people cannot purchase apps from google play        in       google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps  but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack  google responded that the tool  especially its initial release  was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs  not as a finished piracy solution     in      google released a feature in android     that encrypted paid applications so that they would only work on the device on which they were originally installed from the google play store  but this feature has been temporarily deactivated due to technical issues        both android and android phone manufacturers have been involved in numerous patent lawsuits  on august           oracle sued google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the java programming language     oracle originally sought damages up to      billion     but this valuation was rejected by a united states federal judge who asked oracle to revise the estimate     in response  google submitted multiple lines of defense  counterclaiming that android did not infringe on oracle s patents or copyright  that oracle s patents were invalid  and several other defenses  they said that android is based on apache harmony  a clean room implementation of the java class libraries  and an independently developed virtual machine called dalvik     in may       the jury in this case found that google did not infringe on oracle s patents  and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the java apis used by google was not copyrightable        the parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for a small amount of copied code     on may          the federal circuit partially reversed the district court ruling  ruling in oracle s favor on the copyrightability issue  and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court           in addition to lawsuits against google directly  various proxy wars have been waged against android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of android devices  with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an android device to market     both apple and microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement  with apple s ongoing legal action against samsung being a particularly high profile case  in october       microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with ten android device manufacturers  whose products account for      in the u s   xa  and     of the worldwide revenue for android devices     these include samsung and htc     samsung s patent settlement with microsoft includes an agreement that samsung will allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running microsoft s windows phone operating system        google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the united states  accusing apple  oracle and microsoft of trying to take down android through patent litigation  rather than innovating and competing with better products and services     in          google purchased motorola mobility for us      billion  which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect android  since motorola mobility held more than        patents     in december       google bought over a thousand patents from ibm        in       fairsearch  a lobbying organization supported by microsoft  oracle and others  filed a complaint regarding android with the european commission  alleging that its free of charge distribution model constituted anti competitive predatory pricing  the free software foundation europe  whose donors include google  disputed the fairsearch allegations        the open and customizable nature of android allows it to be used on other electronics aside from smartphones and tablets  including laptops and netbooks  smartbooks     smart tvs  android tv  google tv  and cameras  e g  galaxy camera      in addition  the android operating system has seen applications on smart glasses  google glass   smartwatches     headphones     car cd and dvd players     mirrors     portable media players     landline    and voice over ip phones     ouya  a video game console running android  became one of the most successful kickstarter campaigns  crowdfunding us    m for its development        and was later followed by other android based consoles  such as nvidia s shield portablexa    an android device in a video game controller form factor        in       google demonstrated  android home   a home automation technology which uses android to control a range of household devices including light switches  power sockets and thermostats     prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an android phone or tablet  but android head andy rubin was cautious to note that  turning a lightbulb on and off is nothing new   pointing to numerous failed home automation services  google  he said  was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as a cloud services provider to bring google products into customers  homes           parrot unveiled an android based car stereo system known as asteroid in          followed by a successor  the touchscreen based asteroid smart  in          in       clarion released its own android based car stereo  the ax      in january      at consumer electronics show  google announced the formation of the open automotive alliance  a group including several major automobile makers  audi  general motors  hyundai  and honda  and nvidia  which aims to produce android based in car entertainment systems for automobiles   bringing the best of android into the automobile in a safe and seamless way         on march           google announced android wear  an android based platform specifically intended for smartwatches and other wearable devices  only a developer preview was made publicly available     this was followed by the unveiling of two android wear based devices  the lg g watch and moto            on june           at google i o  it was announced that android tv  a smart tv platform  is replacing the previously released google tv  on june           google announced android auto for the car
