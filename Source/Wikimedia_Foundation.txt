extensions  followed by a qualitative statistical survey focusing on volume of edits  number of new users  and related statistics  in march       a usability and experience study was carried out on new and non editors of the english wikipedia  the aim was to discover what obstacles participants encountered while editing wikipedia  ranging from small changes to more complicated syntax such as templates  the study recruited      people for in person laboratory testing via the wikipedia website  which was filtered down to ten participants  the results were collated and used by the technology team to improve wikipedia s usability    the usability and experience study was followed up by the usability  experience and progress study in september       this study recruited different new and non editors for in person trials on a new wikipedia skin       the initiative ultimately culminated in a new wikipedia skin named vector  constructed based on the results of the usability studies

   with a few opensolaris machines for zfscitation needed  as of december     update  there were     in florida and    in amsterdam    wikipedia employed a single server until       when the server setup was expanded into a distributed multitier architecture  in january       the project ran on    dedicated servers in florida citation needed this configuration included a single master database server running mysql  multiple slave database servers     web servers running the apache http server  and seven squid cache servers     wikipedia receives between        and        page requests per second  depending on the time of day    page requests are first passed to a front end layer of squid caching servers    further statistics are available based on a publicly available   months wikipedia access trace    requests that cannot be served from the squid cache are sent to load balancing servers running the linux virtual server software  which in turn pass the request to one of the apache web servers for page rendering from the database  the web servers deliver pages as requested  performing page rendering for all the language editions of wikipedia  to increase speed further  rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated  allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses     the operation of wikimedia depends on mediawiki  a custom made  free and open source wiki software platform written in php and built upon the mysql database    the software incorporates programming features such as a macro language  variables  a transclusion system for templates  and url redirection  mediawiki is licensed under the gnu general public license and it is used by all wikimedia projects  as well as many other wiki projects  originally  wikipedia ran on usemodwiki written in perl by clifford adams  phase i   which initially required camelcase for article hyperlinks  the present double bracket style was incorporated later  starting in january       phase ii   wikipedia began running on a php wiki engine with a mysql database  this software was custom made for wikipedia by magnus manske  the phase ii software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand  in july       phase iii   wikipedia shifted to the third generation software  mediawiki  originally written by lee daniel crocker  several mediawiki extensions are installed   to extend the functionality of mediawiki software  in april       a lucene extension     was added to mediawiki s built in search and wikipedia switched from mysql to lucene for searching  currently lucene search        which is written in java and based on lucene library        is used     wikimedia foundation also uses civicrm   and wordpress       the wikimedia foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission    it is exempt from federal income tax     and from state income tax      it is not a private foundation  and contributions to it qualify as tax deductible charitable contributions       the continued technical and economic growth of each of the wikimedia projects is dependent mostly
