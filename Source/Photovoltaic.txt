 photovoltaics  pv  is a method of converting solar energy into direct current electricity using semiconducting materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect  a photovoltaic system employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells to supply usable solar power  power generation from solar pv has long been seen as a clean sustainable  energy technology which draws upon the planet s most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source   the sun  the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts or environmental emissions during operation  it is well proven  as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialized applications  and grid connected pv systems have been in use for over twenty years   they were first mass produced in the year       when german environmentalists including eurosolar succeeded in obtaining government support for the         roofs program      driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication  the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured    and the levelised cost of electricity  lcoe  from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions   net metering and financial incentives  such as preferential feed in tariffs for solar generated electricity  have supported solar pv installations in many countries   with current technology  photovoltaics recoup the energy needed to manufacture them in      in southern europe  to     years  in northern europe       solar pv is now  after hydro and wind power  the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity  more than     countries use solar pv  installations may be ground mounted  and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing  or built into the roof or walls of a building  either building integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop      in       the fast growing capacity of worldwide installed solar pv increased by   xa percent to     gigawatts  gw   this is sufficient to generate at least     terawatt hours  twh  or about     xa percent of the electricity demand on the planet  as of early       worldwide installed solar pv has increased to     gw   china  followed by japan and the united states  is now the fastest growing market  while germany remains the world s largest producer  contributing almost   percent to its national electricity demands                  the term  photovoltaic  comes from the greek      ph s  meaning  light   and from  volt   the unit of electro motive force  the volt  which in turn comes from the last name of the italian physicist alessandro volta  inventor of the battery  electrochemical cell   the term  photo voltaic  has been in use in english since            photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons  the photovoltaic effect refers to photons of light exciting electrons into a higher state of energy  allowing them to act as charge carriers for an electric current  the photovoltaic effect was first observed by alexandre edmond becquerel in           the term photovoltaic denotes the unbiased operating mode of a photodiode in which current through the device is entirely due to the transduced light energy  virtually all photovoltaic devices are some type of photodiode     solar cells produce direct current electricity from sun light which can be used to power equipment or to recharge a battery  the first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft  but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation  in this case an inverter is required to convert the dc to ac  there is a smaller market for off grid power for remote dwellings  boats  recreational vehicles  electric cars  roadside emergency telephones  remote sensing  and cathodic protection of pipelines     photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material  materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon  polycrystalline silicon  amorphous silicon  cadmium telluride  and copper indium gallium selenide sulfide    copper solar cables connect modules  module cable   arrays  array cable   and sub fields  because of the growing demand for renewable energy sources  the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years           solar photovoltaics power generation has long been seen as a clean energy technology which draws upon the planet s most plentiful and widely distributed renewable energy source   the sun  the technology is  inherently elegant  in that the direct conversion of sunlight to electricity occurs without any moving parts or environmental emissions during operation  it is well proven  as photovoltaic systems have now been used for fifty years in specialised applications  and grid connected systems have been in use for over twenty years     cells require protection from the environment and are usually packaged tightly behind a glass sheet  when more power is required than a single cell can deliver  cells are electrically connected together to form photovoltaic modules  or solar panels  a single module is enough to power an emergency telephone  but for a house or a power plant the modules must be arranged in multiples as arrays     photovoltaic power capacity is measured as maximum power output under standardized test conditions  stc  in  wp   watts peak     the actual power output at a particular point in time may be less than or greater than this standardized  or  rated   value  depending on geographical location  time of day  weather conditions  and other factors    solar photovoltaic array capacity factors are typically under      which is lower than many other industrial sources of electricity       for best performance  terrestrial pv systems aim to maximize the time they face the sun  solar trackers achieve this by moving pv panels to follow the sun  the increase can be by as much as     in winter and by as much as     in summer  static mounted systems can be optimized by analysis of the sun path  panels are often set to latitude tilt  an angle equal to the latitude  but performance can be improved by adjusting the angle for summer or winter  generally  as with other semiconductor devices  temperatures above room temperature reduce the performance of photovoltaics       a number of solar panels may also be mounted vertically above each other in a tower  if the zenith distance of the sun is greater than zero  and the tower can be turned horizontally as a whole and each panels additionally around a horizontal axis  in such a tower the panels can follow the sun exactly  such a device may be described as a ladder mounted on a turnable disk  each step of that ladder is the middle axis of a rectangular solar panel  in case the zenith distance of the sun reaches zero  the  ladder  may be rotated to the north or the south to avoid a solar panel producing a shadow on a lower solar panel  instead of an exactly vertical tower one can choose a tower with an axis directed to the polar star  meaning that it is parallel to the rotation axis of the earth  in this case the angle between the axis and the sun is always larger than    degrees  during a day it is only necessary to turn the panels around this axis to follow the sun  installations may be ground mounted  and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing    or built into the roof or walls of a building  building integrated photovoltaics      although it is important to have an efficient solar cell  it is not necessarily the efficient solar cell that consumers will use  it is important to have efficient solar cells that are the best value for the money  efficiency of pv cells can be measured by calculating how much they can convert sunlight into usable energy for human consumption  maximum efficiency of a solar photovoltaic cell is given by the following equation    maximum efficiency   p maximum power output   e s    incident radiation flux  a c  area of collector      if the area provided is limited  efficiency of the pv cell is important to achieve the desired power output over a limited area     the most efficient solar cell so far is a multi junction concentrator solar cell with an efficiency of         produced by solar junction in april       the highest efficiencies achieved without concentration include sharp corporation at       using a proprietary triple junction manufacturing technology in         and boeing spectrolab        also using a triple layer design   the us company sunpower produces cells that have an energy conversion ratio of        well above the market average of          citation needed    there have been numerous attempts to cut down the costs of pv cells and modules to the point that will be both competitive and efficient  this can be achieved by significantly increasing the conversion efficiency of pv materials  in order to increase the efficiency of solar cells  it is necessary to choose the semiconductor material with appropriate energy gap that matches the solar spectrum  this will enhance their electrical  optical  and structural properties  choosing a better approach to get more effective charge collection is also necessary to increase the efficiency  there are several groups of materials that fit into different efficiency regimes  ultrahigh efficiency devices            are made by using gaas and gainp  semiconductors with multijunction tandem cells  high quality  single crystal silicon materials are used to achieve high efficiency cells             organic photovoltaic cells  opvs  are also viable alternative that relieves energy pressure and environmental problems from increasing combustion of fossil fuels  recent development of opvs made a huge advancement of power conversion efficiency from    to over         to date  the highest reported power conversion efficiency ranges from      to       for small molecule             for polymer opvs  and    to     for perovskite opvs     not only does recent development of opvs make them more efficient and low cost  they also make it environmentally benign and renewable     several companies have begun embedding power optimizers into pv modules called smart modules  these modules perform maximum power point tracking  mppt  for each module individually  measure performance data for monitoring  and provide additional safety  such modules can also compensate for shading effects  wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero  but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero       at the end of september       ikea announced that solar panel packages for houses will be sold at    united kingdom ikea stores by the end of july       the decision followed a successful pilot project at the lakeside ikea store  whereby one photovoltaic  pv  system was sold almost every day  the panels are manufactured by the chinese company hanergy       solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly  albeit from a small base  to a total global capacity of     gigawatts  gw  at the end of       the total power output of the world s pv capacity in a calendar year is equal to some     billion kwh of electricity      this is sufficient to cover the annual power supply needs of    million households in the world  and represents      percent of worldwide electricity demand  more than     countries use solar pv      china  followed by japan and the united states is now the fastest growing market  while germany remains the world s largest producer  contributing almost   percent to its national electricity demands   photovoltaics is now  after hydro and wind power  the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity       the      european photovoltaic industry association  epia  report estimates global pv installations to grow      xa gw in       china is predicted to take the lead from germany and to become the world s largest producer of pv power in       by      the worldwide photovoltaic capacity is projected to have doubled  low scenario of    xa gw  or even tripled  high scenario of    xa gw  within five years  the epia also estimates that photovoltaics will meet    to    percent of europe s energy demand in          the epia greenpeace solar generation paradigm shift scenario  formerly called advanced scenario  from      shows that by the year            xa gw of pv systems could be generating approximately      xa twh year of electricity around the world  combined with energy use efficiency improvements  this would represent the electricity needs of more than   percent of the world s population  by       over    percent of all electricity could be provided by photovoltaics       michael liebreich  from bloomberg new energy finance  anticipates a tipping point for solar energy  the costs of power from wind and solar are already below those of conventional electricity generation in some parts of the world  as they have fallen sharply and will continue to do so  he also asserts  that the electrical grid has been greatly expanded worldwide  and is ready to receive and distribute electricity from renewable sources  in addition  worldwide electricity prices came under strong pressure from renewable energy sources  that are  in part  enthusiastically embraced by consumers       deutsche bank sees a  second gold rush  for the photovoltaic industry to come  grid parity has already been reached in at least    markets by january       photovoltaics will prevail beyond feed in tariffs  becoming more competitive as deployment increases and prices continue to fall       in june      barclays downgraded bonds of u s  utility companies  barclays expects more competition by a growing self consumption due to a combination of decentralized pv systems and residential electricity storage  this could fundamentally change the utility s business model and transform the system over the next ten years  as prices for these systems are predicted to fall       pv technologies have shown significant progress lately in terms of annual production capacity and life cycle environmental performances  which necessitates the assessment of environmental impacts of such technologies  the different pv technologies show slight variations in the emissions when compared the emissions from conventional energy technologies that replaced by the latest pv technologies    with the up scaling of thin film module production for meeting future energy needs  there is a growing need for conducting the life cycle assessment of such technologies to analyze the future environmental impacts resulting from such technologies       the manufacturing processes of solar cell involve the emissions of several toxic  flammable and explosive chemicals  lately  in the field of photovoltaic research  there has been a continual rise in research and development efforts focused on reducing mass during cell manufacture  such efforts have resulted in reducing the thickness of solar cells and thus the next generation solar cells are becoming thinner and eventually risks of exposure are reduced nevertheless  all chemicals must be carefully handled to ensure minimal human and environmental contact  the large scale deployment of such renewable energy technologies could result in potential negative environmental implications  these potential problems can pose serious challenges in promulgating such technologies to a broad segment of consumers  evans  strezov    evans        tsoutsos  frantzeskaki    gekas        vasilis m fthenakis                     there are studies which have shown that the pv environmental impacts come mainly from the production of the cells  operation and maintenance requirements and associated impacts are relatively small  however  in a more recent study by collier  wu  and apul           they conducted the life cycle assessment for czts and zn p  pv technologies for the first time  in this study  the cradle to gate environmental impacts from czts and zn p  are assessed and compared with those from current commercial pv technologies such as cdte and cigs  the four impacts including primary energy demand  ped   global warming potential  gwp   freshwater use and eco toxicity were primarily studied  for all four impacts studied  cdte and zn p  performed better than cigs and czts  in general  the contribution of raw  absorber  material extraction and processing to the total impacts was low compared with impacts coming from electricity consumption during manufacturing  therefore  to reduce environmental impact  future pv technology development should focus more on the process improvement    the future research should also focus on the water energy nexus as it is crucial to understand the water impacts of potential pv technologies in order to better manage our water resources     source  apricus      there have been major changes in the underlying costs  industry structure and market prices of solar photovoltaics technology  over the years  and gaining a coherent picture of the shifts occurring across the industry value chain globally is a challenge  this is due to   the rapidity of cost and price changes  the complexity of the pv supply chain  which involves a large number of manufacturing processes  the balance of system  bos  and installation costs associated with complete pv systems  the choice of different distribution channels  and differences between regional markets within which pv is being deployed   further complexities result from the many different policy support initiatives that have been put in place to facilitate photovoltaics commercialisation in various countries      the pv industry has seen dramatic drops in module prices since       in late       factory gate prices for crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the       w mark  the       w installed cost  is often regarded in the pv industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for pv  technological advancements  manufacturing process improvements  and industry re structuring  mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years      financial incentives for photovoltaics  such as feed in tariffs  have often been offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar electric generating systems  government has sometimes also offered incentives in order to encourage the pv industry to achieve the economies of scale needed to compete where the cost of pv generated electricity is above the cost from the existing grid  such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial energy independence  high tech job creation and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which cause global warming  due to economies of scale solar panels get less costly as people use and buy more as manufacturers increase production to meet demand  the cost and price is expected to drop in the years to come     solar cell efficiencies vary from    for amorphous silicon based solar cells to       with multiple junction concentrated photovoltaics    solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around             concentrated photovoltaics  cpv  may reduce cost by concentrating up to       suns  through magnifying lens  onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell  however  such concentrated solar power requires sophisticated heat sink designs  otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats  which reduces its efficiency and life  to further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design  the heat sink must be passive  otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy     crystalline silicon solar cell prices have fallen from        watt in      to an estimated       watt in         this is seen as evidence supporting swanson s law  an observation similar to the famous moore s law that states that solar cell prices fall     for every doubling of industry capacity       as of       the price of pv modules has fallen by     since the summer of       according to bloomberg new energy finance estimates  putting solar power for the first time on a competitive footing with the retail price of electricity in a number of sunny countries  an alternative and consistent price decline figure of     from      to      has also been published    though it is unclear whether these figures are specific to the united states or generally global  the levelised cost of electricity  lcoe  from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions   particularly when the time of generation is included  as electricity is worth more during the day than at night    there has been fierce competition in the supply chain  and further improvements in the levelised cost of energy for solar lie ahead  posing a growing threat to the dominance of fossil fuel generation sources in the next few years    as time progresses  renewable energy technologies generally get cheaper      while fossil fuels generally get more expensive     the less solar power costs  the more favorably it compares to conventional power  and the more attractive it becomes to utilities and energy users around the globe  utility scale solar power can now be delivered in california at prices well below      mwh        kwh  less than most other peak generators  even those running on low cost natural gas  lower solar module costs also stimulate demand from consumer markets where the cost of solar compares very favorably to retail electric rates       as of       the cost of pv has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further  the average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the solarbuzz group fell from       watt to       watt over the course of            for large scale installations  prices below       watt were achieved  a module price of      euro watt        watt  was published for a large scale   year deal in april            by the end of       the  best in class  module price had dropped to       watt  and was expected to drop to       watt by            in many locations  pv has reached grid parity  which is usually defined as pv production costs at or below retail electricity prices  though often still above the power station prices for coal or gas fired generation without their distribution and other costs   however  in many countries there is still a need for more access to capital to develop pv projects  to solve this problem securitization has been proposed and used to accelerate development of solar photovoltaic projects      for example  solarcity offered  the first u s  asset backed security in the solar industry in            photovoltaic power is also generated during a time of day that is close to peak demand  precedes it  in electricity systems with high use of air conditioning  more generally  it is now evident that  given a carbon price of     ton  which would raise the price of coal fired power by  c kwh  solar pv will be cost competitive in most locations  the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations  totaling about   xa gw in       although some consolidation is likely in       due to support cuts in the large markets of germany and italy  strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade  already  by one estimate  total investment in renewables for      exceeded investment in carbon based electricity generation       in the case of self consumption payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not brought from the grid  additionally  using pv solar power to charge dc batteries  as used in plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles  leads to greater efficiencies  traditionally  dc generated electricity from solar pv must be converted to ac for buildings  at an average     loss during the conversion  an additional efficiency loss occurs in the transition back to dc for battery driven devices and vehicles  and using various interest rates and energy price changes were calculated to find present values that range from           to            analysis from             for example in germany with electricity prices of      euro kwh and insolation of     kwh kw one kwp will save     euro per year and with installation cost of      euro kwp means that the system will pay back in less than   years       many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built  mainly in europe    as of july       the largest photovoltaic  pv  power plants in the world are the agua

 the blythe solar power project is a    xa mw photovoltaic station under construction in riverside county  california  the california valley solar ranch  cvsr  is a    xa mw solar photovoltaic power

construction in the antelope valley area of the western mojave desert  and due to be completed in         the mesquite solar project is a photovoltaic solar power plant being built in arlington  maricopa county  arizona  owned by sempra generation    phasexa   will have a nameplate capacity of    xa megawatts       many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems   that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed mounted systems  there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations     photovoltaic arrays are often associated with buildings  either integrated into them  mounted on them or mounted nearby on the ground     arrays are most often retrofitted into existing buildings  usually mounted on top of the existing roof structure or on the existing walls  alternatively  an array can be located separately from the building but connected by cable to supply power for the building  in       more than four fifths of the      xa mw of solar pv operating in germany were installed on rooftops    building integrated photovoltaics  bipv  are increasingly incorporated into new domestic and industrial buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power    typically  an array is incorporated into the roof or walls of a building  roof tiles with integrated pv cells are also common  a      study using thermal imaging has shown that solar panels  provided there is an open gap in which air can circulate between them and the roof  provide a passive cooling effect on buildings during the day and also keep accumulated heat in at night       the power output of photovoltaic systems for installation in buildings is usually described in kilowatt peak units  kwp      pv has traditionally been used for electric power in space  pv is rarely used to provide motive power in transport applications  but is being used increasingly to provide auxiliary power in boats and cars  some automobiles are fitted with solar powered air conditioning to limit interior temperatures on hot days    a self contained solar vehicle would have limited power and utility  but a solar charged electric vehicle allows use of solar power for transportation  solar powered cars  boats   and airplanes   have been demonstrated  with the most practical and likely of these being solar cars       until a decade or so ago  pv was used frequently to power calculators and novelty devices  improvements in integrated circuits and low power liquid crystal displays make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes  making pv use less common  in contrast  solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive  such applications include solar lamps  water pumps    parking meters      emergency telephones  trash compactors    temporary traffic signs  charging stations      and remote guard posts and signals     developing countries where many villages are often more than five kilometers away from grid power are increasingly using photovoltaics  in remote locations in india a rural lighting program has been providing solar powered led lighting to replace kerosene lamps  the solar powered lamps were sold at about the cost of a few months  supply of kerosene      cuba is working to provide solar power for areas that are off grid    more complex applications of off grid solar energy use include  d printers    reprap  d printers have been solar powered with photovoltaic technology    which enables distributed manufacturing for sustainable development     these are areas where the social costs and benefits offer an excellent case for going solar  though the lack of profitability has relegated such endeavors to humanitarian efforts  however  solar rural electrification projects have been difficult to sustain due to unfavorable economics  lack of technical support  and a legacy of ulterior motives of north to south technology transfer       in december       the oregon department of transportation placed in service the nation s first solar photovoltaic system in a u s  highway right of way  the     kilowatt  kw  array produces enough electricity to offset approximately one third of the electricity needed to light the interstate highway interchange where it is located       a   xa mi    xa km  section of roadway in idaho is being used to test the possibility of installing solar panels into the road surface  as roads are generally unobstructed to the sun and represent about the percentage of land area needed to replace other energy sources with solar power       in may       the far niente winery in oakville  ca pioneered the world s first  floatovoltaic  system by installing     photovoltaic solar panels onto     pontoons and floating them on the winery s irrigation pond  the floating system generates about    xa kw of peak output and when combined with an array of cells located adjacent to the pond is able to fully offset the winery s electricity consumption       the primary benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose  in the case of the far niente winery  the floating system saved three quarters of an acre that would have been required for a land based system  that land area can instead be used to grow an amount of grapes able to produce          of bottled wine    another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a lower temperature than they would be on land  leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion  the floating panels also reduce the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibit the growth of algae       in       a ul approved solar panel was introduced that is simply plugged into an electrical outlet  it senses mains voltage and waits for five minutes before activating the inverter  and shuts down immediately if line voltage is removed  eliminating any shock hazard from touching the plug prongs  up to five     watt panels can be connected to one outlet       the dye solar cell module is very young photovoltaic technology  the ultimate aim is the successful integration of solar modules into the building facade  researchers at the fraunhofer ise have succeeded in producing the worldwide first dye solar cell module       solar pv power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange  radio and tv broadcasting  microwave and other forms of electronic communication links  this is because  in most telecommunication application  storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically dc  in hilly and mountainous terrain  radio and tv signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain  at these locations  low power transmitters  lpt  are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population       spacecraft operating in the inner solar system usually rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight     photovoltaic solar cells on spacecraft was one of the earliest applications of photovoltaic cells  the first spacecraft to use solar panels was the vanguard   satellite  launched by the us in            solar panels on spacecraft supply power for two principal uses     for both uses  the figure of merit of the solar panels is the power generated per unit mass citation needed as an upper limit of the power the spacecraft has at its disposal per kg  spacecraft  including solar panels  clarification needed to increase the power generated per kg   typical spacecraft solar panels use close packed solar cell rectangles that cover nearly      of the sun visible area of the solar panels  rather than the solar wafer circles  which  even though close packed  cover about     of the sun visible area of typical on earth based solar panels  however  some spacecraft solar panels have solar cells that cover as little as     of the sun visible area        photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors  sometimes known as hybrid pv t systems or pvt  are systems that convert solar radiation into thermal and electrical energy  these systems combine a photovoltaic cell  which converts electromagnetic radiation  photons  into electricity  with a solar thermal collector  which captures the remaining energy and removes waste heat from the pv module  the capture of both electricity and heat allow these devices to have higher exergy    and thus be more overall energy efficient than solar photovoltaic  pv  or solar thermal alone        the    xa pw of sunlight reaching the earth s surface is plentiful almost        times more than the   xa tw equivalent of average power consumed in      by humans     this abundance leads to the suggestion that it will not be long before solar energy will become the world s primary energy source     additionally  solar electric generation has the highest power density  global mean of    xa w m   among renewable energies        solar power is pollution free during use  production end wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls  end of use recycling technologies are under development    and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers        pv installations can operate for     years or even more    with little maintenance or intervention after their initial set up  so after the initial capital cost of building any solar power plant  operating costs are extremely low compared to existing power technologies     grid connected solar electricity can be used locally thus reducing transmission distribution losses  transmission losses in the us were approximately      in              compared to fossil and nuclear energy sources  very little research money has been invested in the development of solar cells  so there is considerable room for improvement  nevertheless  experimental high efficiency solar cells already have efficiencies of over     in case of concentrating photovoltaic cells    and efficiencies are rapidly rising while mass production costs are rapidly falling        in some states of the united states

approximately         for a relatively new       watt pv system  the average size of pv systems in the study
