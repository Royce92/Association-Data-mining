 a microcomputer is a small  relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit  cpu    it includes a microprocessor  memory  and input output  i o  facilities  microcomputers became popular in the     s and   s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors  the predecessors to these computers  mainframes and minicomputers  were comparatively much larger and more expensive  though indeed present day mainframes such as the ibm system z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their cpus   many microcomputers  when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output  are also personal computers  in the generic sense       the abbreviation micro was common during the     s and     s   but has now fallen out of common usage             the term microcomputer came into popular use after the introduction of the minicomputer  although isaac asimov used the term microcomputer in his short story  the dying night  as early as       published in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction in july that year    most notably  the microcomputer replaced the many separate components that made up the minicomputer s cpu with one integrated microprocessor chip  the french developers of the micral n        filed their patents with the term  micro ordinateur   a literal equivalent of  microcomputer   to designate the first solid state machine designed with a microprocessor  in the usa  the earliest models such as the altair      were often sold as kits to be assembled by the user  and came with as little as     bytes of ram  and no input output devices other than indicator lights and switches  useful as a proof of concept to demonstrate what such a simple device could do   however  as microprocessors and semiconductor memory became less expensive  microcomputers in turn grew cheaper and easier to use     all these improvements in cost and usability resulted in an explosion in their popularity during the late     s and early     s  a large number of computer makers packaged microcomputers for use in small business applications  by       many companies such as cromemco  processor technology  imsai  north star computers  southwest technical products corporation  ohio scientific  altos computer systems  morrow designs and others produced systems designed either for a resourceful end user or consulting firm to deliver business systems such as accounting  database management  and word processing to small businesses  this allowed businesses unable to afford leasing of a minicomputer or time sharing service the opportunity to automate business functions  without  usually  hiring a full time staff to operate the computers  a representative system of this era would have used an s    bus  an   bit processor such as an intel      or zilog z    and either cp m or mp m operating system  the increasing availability and power of desktop computers for personal use attracted the attention of more software developers  in time  and as the industry matured  the market for personal computers standardized around ibm pc compatibles running dos  and later windows  modern desktop computers  video game consoles  laptops  tablet pcs  and many types of handheld devices  including mobile phones  pocket calculators  and industrial embedded systems  may all be considered examples of microcomputers according to the definition given above     everyday use of the expression  microcomputer   and in particular the  micro  abbreviation  has declined significantly from the mid     s and has declined in commonplace usage since        the term is most commonly associated with the first wave of all in one   bit home computers and small business microcomputers  such as the apple ii  commodore     bbc micro  and trs      although  or perhaps because  an increasingly diverse range of modern microprocessor based devices fit the definition of  microcomputer   they are no longer referred to as such in everyday speech     in common usage   microcomputer  has been largely supplanted by the term  personal computer  or  pc   which specifies a computer that has been designed to be used by one individual at a time  a term first coined in        ibm first promoted the term  personal computer  to differentiate themselves from other microcomputers  often called  home computers   and also ibm s own mainframes and minicomputerscitation needed   however  following its release  the ibm pc itself was widely imitated  as well as the termcitation needed  the component parts were commonly available to producers and the bios was reverse engineered through cleanroom design techniques  ibm pc compatible  clones  became commonplace  and the terms  personal computer   and especially  pc  stuck with the general public     since the advent of microcontrollers  monolithic integrated circuits containing ram  rom and cpu all onboard   the term  micro  is more commonly used to refer to that meaning citation needed    monitors  keyboards and other devices for input and output may be integrated or separate  computer memory in the form of ram  and at least one other less volatile  memory storage device are usually combined with the cpu on a system bus in one unit  other devices that make up a complete microcomputer system include batteries  a power supply unit  a keyboard and various input output devices used to convey information to and from a human operator  printers  monitors  human interface devices   microcomputers are designed to serve only one user at a time  although they can often be modified with software or hardware to concurrently serve more than one user  microcomputers fit well on or under desks or tables  so that they are within easy access of users  bigger computers like minicomputers  mainframes  and supercomputers take up large cabinets or even dedicated rooms     a microcomputer comes equipped with at least one type of data storage  usually ram  although some microcomputers  particularly early   bit home micros  perform tasks using ram alone  some form of secondary storage is normally desirable  in the early days of home micros  this was often a data cassette deck  in many cases as an external unit   later  secondary storage  particularly in the form of floppy disk and hard disk drives  were built into the microcomputer case     although they did not contain any microprocessors  but were built around transistor transistor logic  ttl   hewlett packard calculators as far back as      had various levels of programmability such that could be called microcomputers  the hp     b        had rudimentary conditional  if  statements  statement line numbers  jump statements  go to   registers that could be used as variables  and primitive subroutines  the programming language resembled assembly language in many ways  later models incrementally added more features  including the basic programming language  hp     a in        some models had tape storage and small printers  however  displays were limited to one line at a time    the hp     a was referred to as a personal computer in an advertisement in a      science magazine   but that advertisement was quickly dropped    it is suspectedwho  that hp was reluctant to call them  computers  because it would complicate government procurement and export procedures citation needed    the datapoint       made by ctc in       is perhaps the best candidate for the title of  first microcomputer   while it contains no microprocessor  the instruction set of its custom ttl processor was the basis of the instruction set for the intel       and for practical purposes the system behaves approximately as if it contains an       this is because intel was the contractor in charge of developing the datapoint s cpu  but ultimately ctc rejected the      design because it needed    support chips       another early system  the kenbak    was released in       like the datapoint       it used discrete transistor transistor logic instead of a microprocessor  but it functioned like a microcomputer in most ways  it was marketed as an educational and hobbyist tool  but it was not a commercial success  production ceased shortly after introduction       in       a french team headed by fran ois gernelle within a small company  r alisations   etudes electroniqes  r e   developed and patented a computer based on a microprocessor   the intel        bit microprocessor  this micral n was marketed in early      as a  micro ordinateur  or microcomputer  mainly for scientific and process control applications  about a hundred micral n were installed in the next two years  followed by a new version based on the intel       meanwhile  another french team developed the alvan  a small computer for office automation which found clients in banks and other sectors  the first version was based on lsi chips with an intel      as peripheral controller  keyboard  monitor and printer   before adopting the zilog z   as main processor     in       a sacramento state university team led by bill pentz built the sac state      computer    able to handle thousands of patients  medical records  the sac state      was designed with the intel       it had a full set of hardware and software components  a disk operating system included in a series of programmable read only memory chips  proms     kilobytes of ram  ibm s basic assembly language  bal   a hard drive  a color display  a printer output  a     bit s serial interface for connecting to a mainframe  and even the world s first microcomputer front panel       virtually all early microcomputers were essentially boxes with lights and switches  one had to read and understand binary numbers and machine language to program and use them  the datapoint      was a striking exception  bearing a modern design based on a monitor  keyboard  and tape and disk drives   of the early  box of switches  type microcomputers  the mits altair             was arguably the most famous  most of these simple  early microcomputers were sold as electronic kits bags full of loose components which the buyer had to solder together before the system could be used     the period from about      to      is sometimes called the first generation of microcomputers  these machines were for engineering development and hobbyist personal use    in       the processor technology sol    was designed  which consisted of one board which included all the parts of the computer system  the sol    had built in eprom software which eliminated the need for rows of switches and lights  the mits altair just mentioned played an instrumental role in sparking significant hobbyist interest  which itself eventually led to the founding and success of many well known personal computer hardware and software companies  such as microsoft and apple computer  although the altair itself was only a mild commercial success  it helped spark a huge industry     by       the introduction of the second generation  known as home computers  made microcomputers considerably easier to use than their predecessors because their predecessors  operation often demanded thorough familiarity with practical electronics  the ability to connect to a monitor  screen  or tv set allowed visual manipulation of text and numbers  the basic language  which was easier to learn and use than raw machine language  became a standard feature  these features were already common in minicomputers  with which many hobbyists and early produces were familiar     in       the launch of the visicalc spreadsheet  initially for the apple ii  first turned the microcomputer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool  after the      release by ibm of its ibm pc  the term personal computer became generally used for microcomputers compatible with the ibm pc architecture  pc compatible      in       the raspberry pi credit card sized single board computer was launched  directly inspired by acorn s bbc micro of       and including support for bbc basic
