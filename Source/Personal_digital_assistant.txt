 a personal digital assistant  pda   also known as a handheld pc  or personal data assistant    is a mobile device that functions as a personal information manager  the term evolved from personal desktop assistant  a software term for an application that prompts or prods the user of a computer with suggestions or provides quick reference to contacts and other lists  pdas were discontinued in early     s after the widespread adoption of smartphones      nearly all pdas have the ability to connect to the internet  a pda has an electronic visual display  enabling it to include a web browser  all models also have audio capabilities enabling use as a portable media player  and also enabling most of them to be used as mobile phones  most pdas can access the internet  intranets or extranets via wi fi or wireless wide area networks  most pdas employ touchscreen technology     the first pda was released in      by psion  the organizer  followed by psion s series    in       which began to resemble the more familiar pda style  it also had a full keyboard    the term pda was first used on january         by apple computer ceo john sculley at the consumer electronics show in las vegas  nevada  referring to the apple newton   in       ibm introduced the first pda with full mobile phone functionality  the ibm simon  which can also be considered the first smartphone  then in       nokia introduced a pda with full mobile phone functionality  the      communicator  which became the world s best selling pda  the communicator spawned a new category of pdas  the  pda phone   now called  smartphone   another early entrant in this market was palm  with a line of pda products which began in march                  a typical pda has a touchscreen for entering data  a memory card slot for data storage  and irda  bluetooth and or wi fi  however  some pdas may not have a touch screen  using softkeys  a directional pad  and a numeric keypad or a thumb keyboard for input  this is typically seen on telephones that are incidentally pdas     in order to have the functions expected of a pda  a device s software typically includes an appointment calendar  a to do list  an address book for contacts  a calculator  and some sort of memo  or  note   program  pdas with wireless data connections also typically include an email client and a web browser     many of the original pdas  such as the apple newton and palm pilot  featured a touchscreen for user interaction  having only a few buttons usually reserved for shortcuts to often used programs  some touchscreen pdas  including windows mobile devices  had a detachable stylus to facilitate making selections  the user interacts with the device by tapping the screen to select buttons or issue commands  or by dragging a finger  or the stylus  on the screen to make selections or scroll     typical methods of entering text on touchscreen pdas include     despite rigorous research and development projects  end users experience mixed results with handwriting recognition systems  some find it frustrating and inaccurate  while others are satisfied with the quality of the recognition      touchscreen pdas intended for business use  such as the blackberry and palm treo  usually also offer full keyboards and scroll wheels or thumbwheels to facilitate data entry and navigation     many touchscreen pdas support some form of external keyboard as well  specialized folding keyboards  which offer a full sized keyboard but collapse into a compact size for transport  are available for many models  external keyboards may attach to the pda directly  using a cable  or may use wireless technology such as infrared or bluetooth to connect to the pda     newer pdas  such as the htc hd   apple iphone  apple ipod touch  and palm pre  palm pre plus  palm pixi  palm pixi plus  google android  operating system  include more advanced forms of touchscreen that can register multiple touches simultaneously  these  multi touch  displays allow for more sophisticated interfaces using various gestures entered with one or more fingers     although many early pdas did not have memory card slots  now most have either some form of secure digital  sd  slot or a compactflash slot  although designed for memory  secure digital input output  sdio  and compactflash cards are available that provide accessories like wi fi or digital cameras  if the device can support them  some pdas also have a usb port  mainly for usb flash drives dubious   discuss some pdas use microsd cards  which are electronically compatible with sd cards  but have a much smaller physical size     while early pdas connected to a user s personal computer via serial ports or another proprietary connection specify many today connect via a usb cable  older pdas were unable to connect to each other via usb  as their implementations of usb didn t support acting as the  host      some early pdas were able to connect to the internet indirectly by means of an external modem connected via the pda s serial port or  sync  connector   or directly by using an expansion card that provided an ethernet port     most modern pdas have bluetooth  a popular wireless protocol for mobile devices  bluetooth can be used to connect keyboards  headsets  gps receivers  and other nearby accessories  it s also possible to transfer files between pdas that have bluetooth     many modern pdas have wi fi wireless network connectivity and can connect to wi fi hotspots   all smartphones  and some other modern pdas  can connect to wireless wide area networks  such as those provided by cellular telecommunications companies     older pdas from the   s to      typically had an irda  infrared  port allowing short range  line of sight wireless communication  few current models use this technology  as it has been supplanted by bluetooth and wi fi  irda allows communication between two pdas  or between a pda and any device with an irda port or adapter  some printers have irda receivers    allowing irda equipped pdas to print to them  if the pda s operating system supports it  universal pda keyboards designed for these older pdas use infrared technology citation needed infrared technology is low cost and has the advantage of being allowed aboard     most pdas can synchronize their data with applications on a user s computer  this allows the user to update contact  schedule  or other information on their computer  using software such as microsoft outlook or act   and have that same data transferred to pda or transfer updated information from the pda back to the computer  this eliminates the need for the user to update their data in two places     synchronization also prevents the loss of information stored on the device if it is lost  stolen  or destroyed  when the pda is repaired or replaced  it can be  re synced  with the computer  restoring the user s data     some users find that data input is quicker on their computer than on their pda  since text input via a touchscreen or small scale keyboard is slower than a full size keyboard  transferring data to a pda via the computer is therefore a lot quicker than having to manually input all data on the handheld device citation needed    most pdas come with the ability to synchronize to a computer  this is done through synchronization software provided with the handheld  or sometime with the computer s operating system  examples of synchronization software include     these programs allow the pda to be synchronized with a personal information manager  which may be part of the computer s operating system  provided with the pda  or sold separately by a third party  for example  the rim blackberry comes with rim s desktop manager program  which can synchronize to both microsoft outlook and act      other pdas come only with their own proprietary software  for example  some early palm os pdas came only with palm desktop  while later palm pdas such as the treo     have the ability to sync to palm desktop or microsoft outlook  microsoft s activesync and windows mobile device center only synchronize with microsoft outlook or a microsoft exchange server citation needed    third party synchronization software is also available for some pdas from companies like commontime   and companionlink    third party software can be used to synchronize pdas to other personal information managers that are not supported by the pda manufacturers  for example  goldmine and ibm lotus notes      some pdas can synchronize some or all of their data using their wireless networking capabilities  rather than having to be directly connected to a personal computer via a cable     apple ios devices  like the iphone  ipod touch  and ipad  can use apple s icloud service  formerly mobileme  to synchronize calendar  address book  mail account  internet bookmark  and other data with one or more macintosh or windows computers using wi fi or cellular data connections       devices running palm s webos or google s android operating system primarily sync with the cloud  for example  if gmail is used  information in contacts  email  and calendar can be synchronized between the phone and google s servers     rim sells blackberry enterprise server to corporations so that corporate blackberry users can wirelessly synchronize their pdas with the company s microsoft exchange server  ibm lotus domino  or novell groupwise servers    email  calendar entries  contacts  tasks  and memos kept on the company s server are automatically synchronized with the blackberry       the most common operating systems pre installed on pdas are      other  rarely used operating systems     some pdas include global positioning system  gps  receivers  this is particularly true of smartphones  other pdas are compatible with external gps receiver add ons that use the pda s processor and screen to display location information       pdas with gps functionality can be used for automotive navigation  pdas are increasingly being fitted as standard on new cars     pda based gps can also display traffic conditions  perform dynamic routing  and show known locations of roadside mobile radar guns  tomtom  garmin  and igo offer gps navigation software for pdas     some businesses and government organizations rely upon rugged pdas  sometimes known as enterprise digital assistants  edas   for mobile data applications  edas often have extra features for data capture  such as barcode readers  radio frequency identification  rfid  readers  magnetic stripe card readers  or smart card readers     typical applications include     many companies have developed pda products aimed at the medical profession s unique needs  such as drug databases  treatment information  and medical news  services such as avantgo translate medical journals into pda readable formats  wardwatch organizes medical records  providing reminders of information such as the treatment regimens of patients to doctors making ward rounds  pendragon and syware provide tools for conducting research with  allowing the user to enter data into a centralized database using their pda  microsoft visual studio and sun java also provide programming tools for developing survey instruments on the handheld  these development tools allow for integration with sql databases that are stored on the handheld and can be synchronized with a desktop  or server based database     pdas have been shown to aid diagnosis and drug selection and some studieswho  have concluded that when patients use pdas to record their symptoms  they communicate more effectively with hospitals during follow up visits     the development of sensor web technology may lead to wearable bodily sensors to monitor ongoing conditions  like diabetes or epilepsy  which would alert patients and doctors when treatment is required using wireless communication and pdas     pdas and handheld devices are allowed in many classrooms for digital note taking  students can spell check  modify  and amend their class notes on a pda  some educatorswho  distribute course material through the internet or infrared file sharing functions of the pda  textbook publishers have begun to release e books  which can be uploaded directly to a pda  reducing the number of textbooks students must carry       software companies have developed pda programs to meet the instructional needs of educational institutions  such as dictionaries  thesauri  word processing software  encyclopedias  and digital lesson planners     pdas may be used by music enthusiasts to play a variety of music file formats  many pdas include the functionality of an mp  player     road rally enthusiasts can use pdas to calculate distance  speed  and time  this information may be used for navigation  or the pda s gps functions can be used for navigation     underwater divers can use pdas to plan breathing gas mixtures and decompression schedules using software such as  v planner
