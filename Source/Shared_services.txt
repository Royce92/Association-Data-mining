 shared services is the provision of a service by one part of an organization or group where that service had previously been found in more than one part of the organization or group  thus the funding and resourcing of the service is shared and the providing department effectively becomes an internal service provider  the key here is the idea of  sharing  within an organization or group  this sharing needs to fundamentally include shared accountability of results by the unit from where the work is migrated to the provider  the provider on the other hand needs to ensure that the agreed results are delivered based on defined measures  kpis  cost  quality etc               shared services is similar to collaboration that might take place between different organizations such as a hospital trust or a police force  for example  adjacent trusts might decide to collaborate by merging their hr or it functions     there are two arguments for sharing services   the  less of a common resource  argument and the  efficiency through industrialization  argument  the former is  obvious   if you have fewer managers  it systems  buildings etc  if you use less of some resource  it will reduce costs  the second argument is  efficiency through industrialization   this argument assumes that efficiencies follow from specialization and standardization   resulting in the creation of  front  and  back  offices  the typical method is to simplify  standardize and then centralize  using an it  solution  as the means     shared services is different from the model of outsourcing  which is where an external third party is paid to provide a service that was previously internal to the buying organization  typically leading to redundancies and re organization  there is an ongoing debate about the advantages of shared services over outsourcing      it is sometimes assumed that a joint venture between a government department and a commercial organization is an example of shared services  the joint venture involves the creation of a separate legal commercial entity  jointly owned   which provides profit to its shareholders     traditionally the development of a shared service organization  sso  or shared service centre  ssc  within an organization is an attempt to reduce costs  often attempted through economies of scale   standardized processes  through centralization   a global service center benchmark study  carried out by the shared services   outsourcing network  sson  and the hackett group  which surveyed more than     companies  found that only about a third of all participants were able to generate cost savings of     or greater from their ssos  at nasa  the      switch to a shared services model is realizing nearly     million of savings annually  further  by the end of       the nasa shared services center is expected to save the organization a total of over      million  according to nasa s director of service delivery      a large scale cultural and process transformation can be a key component of a move to shared services and may include redundancies and changes of work practices  it is claimed that transformation often results in a better quality of work life for employees although there are few case studies to back this upcitation needed     shared services are more than just centralization or consolidation of similar activities in one location  shared services can mean running these service activities like a business and delivering services to internal customers at a cost  quality and timeliness that is competitive with alternatives     the management thinker and inventor of the vanguard method  professor john seddon claims that shared service projects based on attempts to achieve  economies of scale  are a mix of the plausibly obvious and a little hard data  brought together to produce two broad assertions  for which there is little hard factual evidence   he argues that shared service projects fail  and often end up costing more than they hoped to save  because they cause a disruption to the service flow by moving the work to a central location  creating waste in handoffs  rework and duplication  lengthening the time it takes to deliver a service and consequently creating failure demand  demand caused by a failure to do something or do something right for a customer       the english review blog has written a number of articles about flaws in the reporting  research and methodologies used in shared services  e g  the causes of shared services failure       the hr shared services institute  a professional services firm that specializes in this arena  also criticizes many shared services implementations for the same reasons  but does not blame the shared services model itself or centralization per se  rather the cost and scale driven approach many organization take  damning shared services because of these failures is to throw the baby out with the bath water     a shared service can take a variety of different commercial structures  the basic commercial structures include     it is sometimes argued that there are three basic location variations for a shared service including     this is not just to take advantage of wage arbitrage but to appreciate the talents of particular economies in delivering specific service offerings     the difficulty with this argument is that near shore and off shore are normally associated with the outsourcing model and are difficult to reconcile with the notion of an internally shared service as distinct from an externally purchased service  clearly the use of off shore facilities by a government department is not an example of shared services     in establishing and running a shared service  benchmarking and measurement is considered by some as a necessity  benchmarking is the comparison of the service provision usually against best in class  the measurement occurs by using agreed key performance indicators  kpis   although the amount of kpis chosen differs greatly it is generally accepted that fewer than    carefully chosen kpis will deliver the best results citation needed    organizations do attempt to define benchmarks for processes and business operations     benchmarking can be used to achieve different goals including n   to drive performance improvements using benchmarks as a means for setting performance targets that are met either through incremental performance improvements or transformational change n  strategic  with a focus on a long term horizon  andn  tactical  with a focus on the short and medium term       to focus an organization on becoming world class with processes that deliver the highest levels of performance that are better than those of its peer group     the private sector has been moving towards shared services since the beginning of the     s  large organizations such as the bbc  bp  bristol myers squibb  ford  ge  hp  pfizer  rolls royce  arcelormittal  and sap are operating them with great success  according to the english institute of chartered accountants  more than     of u s  fortune     companies have implemented a shared service center  and are reporting cost savings in their general accounting functions of up to         the conventional accounting practice used to generate these figures is disputed however by management thinker professor john seddon  who argues that the measurement known as  unit cost  tells you nothing about overall costs  overall costs include  failure demand   which is defined as a failure to do something or do something right for the customer     the public sector has taken note of the benefits derived in the private sector and continues to strive for best practice  the united states and australia among others have had shared services in government since the late     s  however  the failures of these projects are increasingly being reported by the press  and exposed by opposition politicians       the uk government under a central drive to efficiency following from the gershon review are working to an overall plan for realizing the benefits of shared services  the cabinet office has established a team specifically tasked with the role of accelerating the take up and developing the strategy for all government departments to converge and consolidate  the savings potential of this transformation in the uk public sector was initially estimated by the cabinet office at     bn per annum      of the estimated cost of hr and finance functions   the national audit office  united kingdom  in its november      report   pointed out that this     bn figure lacked a clear baseline of costs and contained several uncertainties  such as the initial expenditure required and the time frame for the savings     there are reports of uk government shared service centres failing to realise savings  such as the department of transport s project  described as  stupendous incompetence  by the parliament s public accounts committee       the northern ireland civil service  nics   has implemented shared services for a number of departments and functions  for example  it assist  the ict shared service centre  provides common infrastructure and desktop services to nics staff in the office  at home or when mobile working       the government of canada instituted shared services canada on august          with the objective of consolidating its data centres  networks and email systems    this follows a tendency to centralize it services that has been followed by the provinces of british columbia  qu bec  and ontario  as well as the federal government of the united states of america and some states like texas  pricewaterhousecoopers recommended integrating government data centres in a report ordered by public works and government services canada  revealed in december            in the republic of ireland  the health service nationally has been reorganized from a set of regional health boards to a unified national structure  the health services executive  within this structure there will be a national shared services organisation  based on the model developed at the former eastern health shared services  where procurement  hr  finance and ict services were provided to health agencies in the eastern region of ireland on a business to business basis     organizations that have centralized their it functions have now begun to take a close look at the technology services that their it departments provide to internal customers  evaluating where it makes sense to provide specific technology components as a shared service  e mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates  many organizations with document intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service     many large organizations  in both the public and private sectors  are now considering deploying enterprise content management  ecm  technology as a shared service
