 a chromebook is a laptop running chrome os as its operating system  the devices are designed to be used primarily while connected to the internet  with most applications and data residing  in the cloud   a chromebook is an example of a thin client        the first chromebooks for sale  by acer inc  and samsung  were announced at the google i o conference in may      and began shipping on june            lenovo  hewlett packard and google itself entered the market in early       in december       samsung launched a samsung chromebook specifically for the indian market that employed the company s exynos   dual core processor   in addition to laptop models  a desktop version  called a chromebox  was introduced in may       and an  all in one  device was introduced in january      by lg electronics     chromebooks are primarily sold both directly from google and from the company s retail partners  by       schools had become the largest category of customer  that october  google broadened its marketing strategy to include first time computer users and households seeking an additional computer  critical reaction to the device was initially skeptical  with some reviewers  such as then new york times technology columnist david pogue   unfavorably comparing the value proposition of chromebooks with that of more fully featured laptops running the microsoft windows operating system  that complaint dissipated later in reviews of machines from acer and samsung that were priced lower   in february       google announced and began shipping the chromebook pixel  a higher spec machine with a high end price tag     in october       simon phipps  writing in infoworld  said   the chromebook line is probably the most successful linux desktop laptop computer we ve seen to date    from january to november            million chromebooks were sold in u s  business to business channels              chromebooks ship with google chrome os  an operating system that uses the linux kernel and the google chrome web browser with an integrated media player      some chromebooks include seabios  which can be turned on to install arbitrary linux distributions  though this requires the use of developer mode      with limited offline capability and a fast boot time  chromebooks are primarily designed for use while connected to the internet    instead of installing traditional applications such as word processing and instant messaging  users add web apps from the chrome web store    google claims that a multi layer security architecture eliminates the need for anti virus software      support for many usb devices such as cameras  mice  external keyboards and flash drives is included  utilizing a feature similar to plug and play on other operating systems  like the prototype cr     chromebooks have a specialized keyboard complete with buttons for opening and controlling multiple browser windows  as well as a web search button which replaces the caps lock key  caps lock being activated by pressing both alt search        an analysis of the samsung series   components by ifixit in june      estimated a total cost of          representing us        in materials and us       in labor  with an initial retail price of us        that also pays for retail margins  shipping  marketing  and research and development  the profit margins on the chromebooks are quite thin  requiring a large production run to make a profit       while chromebooks are designed to be used when connected to the internet  users are able to access google applications such as gmail  google calendar  google keep  and google drive in offline mode  chromebooks also come with a built in local music player  a photo editor  and a pdf  and microsoft office document viewer that are functional without internet access  other apps with offline support include amazon s cloud reader  the new york times app  and angry birds      google play video content is available offline using an extension to the chrome browser       all chromebooks  except the first three  boot with the help of coreboot  a fast booting and free bios         google secured a long list of development partners working on hardware chrome os  including acer  adobe  asus  freescale  hewlett packard  lenovo  qualcomm  texas instruments  toshiba    intel    samsung      and dell    chrome os for business had been led  from its inception  by rajen sheth  best known as the  father of google apps   his strategy for marketing chromebooks centered on the total cost of ownership  which he claimed could be  dramatically  reduced by lower maintenance  management and security costs  even if hardware costs remain unchanged       the first two commercially available chromebooks  the samsung series   and the acer ac     were unveiled on may           at the google i o developer conference  they were to begin selling through online channels  including amazon and best buy in the united states  the united kingdom  france  germany  the netherlands  italy and spain starting june           however  acer s ac    was not available until early july    the first machines sold for between      and       depending on the model and  g option    google also offered a monthly payment scheme for business and education customers at     and     per user  per month  respectively for a three year contract  including replacements and upgrades  verizon offered models equipped with  g  g lte connectivity         mb of free wireless data per month  for two years         google s early marketing efforts relied primarily on hands on experience  giving away samsung machines to    cr    pilot program participants along with the title chromebook guru and loaning chromebooks to passengers on some virgin america flights        at the end of september       google launched the chrome zone  a  store within a store   inside the currys and pc world superstore in london    the store had a google style look and feel with splashes of color all around the retail store front    google said it was planning to open more chrome zones in the uk over the next few months       in addition to these marketing strategies  google chrome has created several  chromebook minis  that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manner  for example  when the question  how do you back up a chromebook  is asked  it is implied to refer to data backup  but instead  shows two hands pushing a chromebook back to the end of a table  this is followed by the statement   you don t have to back up a chromebook   showing how all data is stored on the web       in an article published on zdnet in june       entitled  five chromebook concerns for businesses   steven j  vaughan nichols faulted the devices for lack of virtual private network capability  not supporting some wi fi security methods  in particular wi fi protected access ii  wpa   enterprise with extensible authentication protocol transport layer security  eap tls  or cisco s lightweight extensible authentication protocol  leap   he also noted that its file manager does not work  the need to use the undocumented crosh shell to accomplish basic tasks such as setting up a secure shell  ssh  network connection as well as serious deficiencies in documentation       in one of the first customer reviews  the city of orlando  florida reported on their initial testing of     chromebooks as part of a broader study related to accessing virtual desktops  early indications show potential value in reducing it support costs  end users have indicated that the chromebook is easy to travel with and starts up quickly  one stated that  if i just need to stay connected for emergencies  i take my chrome   but when traveling for business she would still take her laptop  orlando does plan to continue to use the chromebooks       on november           google announced price reductions on all chromebooks    since then  the wi fi only samsung series   was reduced to       the  g samsung series   was reduced to       and the acer ac    was reduced to       by january       commercial sales for chromebooks were flat  with the exception of the education market  google had placed nearly        chromebooks in schools across    states  including  one on one  programs  which allocate a computer for every student  in south carolina  illinois  and iowa    as of august       over     school districts in the united states and europe were using the device  as well as universities  corporations and government facilities         the updated series       and the chromebox  the first chromeos desktop machines  were released by samsung in may               while the two lowest cost chromebooks emerged later in the fall  the        samsung series   and the        acer c   the following february  google introduced the most costly machine  their chromebook pixel  with a starting price of          all models released after may       include    gb     tb of google drive cloud storage and    gogo wifi passes         by january       acer s chromebook sales were being driven by  heavy internet users with educational institutions   and the platform represented      percent of the company s u s  shipments  according to acer president jim wong  he called those numbers sustainable  contrasting them with low windows   sales which he blamed for a slump in the market  wong said that the company would consider marketing chromebooks to other developed countries  as well as to corporations  he noted that although chrome os is free to license for hardware vendors  it has required greater marketing expenditure than windows  offsetting the licensing savings       in april       intel said that its bay trail chips will be used in a series of inexpensive touchscreen laptops primarily running google s android operating system  the move would create a direct competitor to chromebooks  as well as windows   laptops  using google s other operating system    a year later  the product category had not gained traction       during the first    months of            million chromebooks sold in the united states  representing     of the u s  commercial business to business laptop market  during the same period in       chromebooks sold         units and had a negligible market share      in january      silviu stahie noted in softpedia that chromebooks were eating into microsoft s market share  he said  microsoft is engaged in a silent war and it s actually losing  they are fighting an enemy that is so insidious and so cunning that it s actually hurting the company more than anything else  the enemy is called chromebooks and they are using linux   there is no sign that things are slowing down and microsoft really needs a win  and soon if it wants to remain relevant        the generation of most products can be inferred from the corresponding video game series     at a december          press briefing        google announced the chrome os pilot program  a pilot study and the first chromebook  the cr    chrome notebook  a prototype  to test the chrome os operating system and modified hardware for it  the device had a minimal design and was all black  completely unbranded although it was made by inventec    and had a rubberized coating  the device was named after chromium     an unstable isotope of the metallic element chromium    and the participants were named cr    test pilots  google distributed about        cr    chrome notebooks between december      and march          for free to participants and in return asked for feedback such as suggestions and bug reports  the cr    was intended for testing only  not retail sales           the cr    s hardware design broke convention by replacing certain keys with shortcut keys    such as the function keys  and replacing the caps lock key with a dedicated search key    which can be changed back to caps lock in the os s keyboard settings  google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the internet  demonstrated an offline version of google docs  and announced a  g plan that would give users     mb of free data each month  with additional paid plans available from verizon         the device s usb port is capable of supporting a keyboard  mouse  ethernet adapter  or usb storage  but not a printer  as chrome os offers no print stack    adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating system s  self knowing  security model    users instead were encouraged to use a secure service called google cloud print to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers  or to connect an hp eprint  kodak hero  kodak esp  or epson connect printer to the google cloud print service for a  cloud aware  printer connection       the cr    prototype laptop gave reviewers their first opportunity to evaluate chrome os running on a device  ryan paul of ars technica wrote that the machine  met the basic requirements for web surfing  gaming  and personal productivity  but falls short for more intensive tasks   he praised google s approach to security  but wondered whether mainstream computer users would accept an operating system whose only application is a browser  he thought chrome os  could appeal to some niche audiences   people who just need a browser or companies that rely on google apps and other web applications  but the operating system was  decidedly not a full fledged alternative to the general purpose computing environments that currently ship on netbooks   paul wrote that most of chrome os s advantages  can be found in other software environments without having to sacrifice native applications        in reviewing the cr    on december           kurt bakke of conceivably tech wrote that a chromebook had become the most frequently used family appliance in his household   its    second startup time and dedicated google user accounts made it the go to device for quick searches  email as well as youtube and facebook activities   but the device did not replace other five notebooks in the house  one for gaming  two for the kids  and two more for general use   the biggest complaint i heard was its lack of performance in flash applications        in ongoing testing  wolfgang gruener  also writing in conceivably tech  said that cloud computing at cellular data speeds is unacceptable and that the lack of offline ability turns the cr     into a useless brick  when not connected     it s difficult to use the chromebook as an everyday device and give up what you are used to on a mac windows pc  while you surely enjoy the dedicated cloud computing capabilities occasionally        launched by google in february       the chromebook pixel remains the high end machine in the chromebook family  the laptop has an unusual     display aspect ratio touch screen featuring what was at its debut the highest pixel density of any laptop    a faster cpu than its predecessors in the intel core i   and an exterior design described by wired as  an austere rectangular block of aluminum with subtly rounded edges     a second pixel featuring lte wireless communication and twice the storage capacity was shipped for arrival on april                the machine received much media attention  with many reviewers questioning the pixel s value proposition compared to similarly priced windows machines and the macbook air         reviewing the samsung series   specifications  scott stein of cnet was unimpressed with a machine with a    inch screen and just    gb of onboard storage   chrome os might be lighter than windows xp  but we d still prefer more media storage space  at this price  you could also get an      inch     xa mm  wi fi amd e     powered ultraportable running windows       on the other hand  mg siegler of techcrunch wrote a largely favorable review  praising the improvements in speed and trackpad sensitivity over the cr    prototype  as well as the long battery life and the fact that all models are priced below the ipad       in june      ifixit dismantled a samsung series   and concluded that it was essentially an improved cr     they rated it as      for repairability  predominantly because the case has to be opened to change the battery and because the ram chip is soldered to the motherboard  ifixit noted that the  mostly plastic construction  felt  a little cheap   on the plus side they stated that the screen was easy to remove and most of the components  including the solid state drive would be easy to replace  ifixit s kyle wiens wrote that the series    fixes the major shortfalls of the cr    and adds the polish necessary to strike lust into the heart of a broad consumer base  sleek looks     hours of battery life  and optimized performance        in may       samsung introduced the chromebook series        with a wi fi model and more expensive  g model       reviews generally questioned the value proposition  dana wollman of engadget wrote that the chromebook s keyboard  put thousand dollar ultrabooks to shame  and offered better display quality than on many laptops selling for twice as much  but the price  seems to exist in a vacuum a place where tablet apps aren t growing more sophisticated  where transformer like win  tablets aren t on the way and where there aren t some solid budget windows machines to choose from         joe wilcox of betanews wrote that  price to performance and how it compares to other choices  is  where chromebook crumbles for many potential buyers   he noted that the new models sell for more than their predecessors  and while the price performance ratio is quite favorable compared to the macbook air   by the specs  there are plenty of lower cost options        in october       the series   chromebook was introduced at a san francisco event with the samsung chromebook xe     the device was cheaper  thinner and lighter than the chromebook      google marketed the series   as the computer for everyone  due to its simple operating system  chrome os  and affordable price  target markets included students and first time computer users  as well as households looking for an extra computer         the lower price proved a watershed for some reviewers  new york times technology columnist david pogue reversed his earlier thumbs down verdict on the chromebook  writing that       changes everything   the price is half that of an  ipad  even less than an ipad mini or an ipod touch  and you re getting a laptop   he wrote that the chromebook does many of the things people use computers and laptops for  playing flash videos  and opening microsoft office documents   in other words  google is correct when it asserts that the chromebook is perfect for schools  second computers in homes and businesses who deploy hundreds of machines        cnet s review of the series   chromebook was even more favorable  saying the machine largely delivered as a computer for students and as an additional computer for a household especially for users who are already using google web applications like google docs  google drive  and gmail   it s got workable if not standout hardware  its battery life is good  it switches on quickly  and the      price tag means it s not as much of a commitment as the      samsung series       that arrived in may   the review subtracted points for performance   it s fine for many tasks  but power users accustomed to having more than a couple dozen browser tabs open should steer clear        hp introduced the chromebook    on october         in the us    in december       google and hp recalled         chargers due to overheating     sales were halted  resuming with a redesigned charger the following month     the hp chromebook    was announced september              with an intel haswell celeron processor  usb     ports  and  g broadband  engadget praised the computer s design and convenient micro usb charging  but criticized a sticky trackpad and short battery life  worse than the samsung chromebook with the same exynos processor     an updated version of the chromebook lineup was announced on september          the    inch models included an intel processor while the    inch models featured a fanless design powered by a nvidia tegra k  processor  hp chromebooks are available in several colors        two types of desktop computers also run chrome os     classed as small form factor pcs  chromeboxes typically feature a power switch and a set of ports  local area network  usb  dvi d  displayport  and audio  as with
