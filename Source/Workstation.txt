 a workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications  intended primarily to be used by one person at a time  they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi user operating systems  the term workstation has also been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a pc connected to a network  but the most common form refers to the group of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as sun microsystems  silicon graphics  apollo computer  dec  hp and ibm which opened the door for the  d graphics animation revolution of the late     s     workstations offered higher performance than mainstream personal computers  especially with respect to cpu and graphics  memory capacity  and multitasking capability  workstations were optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as  d mechanical design  engineering simulation  e g  computational fluid dynamics   animation and rendering of images  and mathematical plots  typically  the form factor is that of a desktop computer  consist of a high resolution display  a keyboard and a mouse at a minimum  but also offer multiple displays  graphics tablets   d mice  devices for manipulating  d objects and navigating scenes   etc  workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories and collaboration tools     the increasing capabilities of mainstream pcs in the late     s have blurred the lines somewhat with technical scientific workstations  the workstation market previously employed proprietary hardware which made them distinct from pcs  for instance ibm used risc based cpus for its workstations and intel x   cpus for its business consumer pcs during the     s and     s  however by the late     s this difference disappeared  as workstations now use highly commoditized hardware dominated by large pc vendors  such as dell and hp   fujitsu  selling microsoft windows or gnu linux systems running on x      architecture such as intel xeon or amd opteron cpus             perhaps the first computer that might qualify as a  workstation  was the ibm       a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console  it was introduced in       one peculiar feature of the machine was that it lacked any actual arithmetic circuitry  to perform addition  it required a memory resident table of decimal addition rules  this saved on the cost of logic circuitry  enabling ibm to make it inexpensive  the machine was code named cadet and rented initially for       a month     in       ibm introduced the ibm      scientific computer  which was meant as the successor to the       both of these systems came with the ability to run programs written in fortran and other languages  both the      and the      were built into roughly desk sized cabinets  both were available with add on disk drives  printers  and both paper tape and punched card i o  a console typewriter for direct interaction was standard on each     early examples of workstations were generally dedicated minicomputers  a system designed to support a number of users would instead be reserved exclusively for one person  a notable example was the pdp   from digital equipment corporation  regarded to be the first commercial minicomputer     the lisp machines developed at mit in the early     s pioneered some of the principles of the workstation computer  as they were high performance  networked  single user systems intended for heavily interactive use  lisp machines were commercialized beginning      by companies like symbolics  lisp machines  texas instruments  the ti explorer  and xerox  the interlisp d workstations   the first computer designed for single users  with high resolution graphics facilities  and so a workstation in the modern sense of the term  was the xerox alto developed at xerox parc in       other early workstations include the terak      a         three rivers perq        and the later xerox star            in the early     s  with the advent of    bit microprocessors such as the motorola        a number of new participants in this field appeared  including apollo computer and sun microsystems  who created unix based workstations based on this processor  meanwhile darpa s vlsi project created several spinoff graphics products as well  notably the sgi       and silicon graphics  range of machines that followed  it was not uncommon to differentiate the target market for the products  with sun and apollo considered to be network workstations  while the sgi machines were graphics workstations  as risc microprocessors became available in the mid     s  these were adopted by many workstation vendors     workstations tended to be very expensive  typically several times the cost of a standard pc and sometimes costing as much as a new car  however  minicomputers sometimes cost as much as a house  the high expense usually came from using costlier components that ran faster than those found at the local computer store  as well as the inclusion of features not found in pcs of the time  such as high speed networking and sophisticated graphics  workstation manufacturers also tend to take a  balanced  approach to system design  making certain to avoid bottlenecks so that data can flow unimpeded between the many different subsystems within a computer  additionally  workstations  given their more specialized nature  tend to have higher profit margins than commodity driven pcs     the systems that come out of workstation companies often feature scsi or fibre channel disk storage systems  high end  d accelerators  single or multiple    bit processors  large amounts of ram  and well designed cooling  additionally  the companies that make the products tend to have very good repair replacement plans  however  the line between workstation and pc is increasingly becoming blurred as the demand for fast computers  networking and graphics have become common in the consumer world  allowing workstation manufacturers to use  off the shelf  pc components and graphics solutions as opposed to proprietary in house developed technology  some  low cost  workstations are still expensive by pc standards  but offer binary compatibility with higher end workstations and servers made by the same vendor  this allows software development to take place on low cost  relative to the server  desktop machines     there have been several attempts to produce a workstation like machine specifically for the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance  one approach is to remove local storage and reduce the machine to the processor  keyboard  mouse and screen  in some cases  these diskless nodes would still run a traditional operating system and perform computations locally  with storage on a remote server  these approaches are intended not just to reduce the initial system purchase cost  but lower the total cost of ownership by reducing the amount of administration required per user     this approach was actually first attempted as a replacement for pcs in office productivity applications  with the  station by  com as an early example  in the     s  x terminals filled a similar role for technical computing  sun has also introduced  thin clients   most notably its sun ray product line  however  traditional workstations and pcs continue to drop in price  which tends to undercut the market for products of this type     in the early     s  a high end workstation had to meet the three ms  the so called   m computer  had a megabyte of memory  a megapixel display  roughly             and a  megaflops  compute performance  at least one million floating point operations per second  a as limited as this seems today  it was at least an order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time  the original      ibm personal computer had   xa kb memory  a text only display  and floating point performance around   kiloflops     kiloflops with the optional      math coprocessor   other desirable features not found in desktop computers at that time included networking  graphics acceleration  and high speed internal and peripheral data buses     another goal was to bring the price for such a system down under a  megapenny   that is  less than          this was not achieved until the late     s  although many workstations  particularly mid range or high end still cost anywhere from         to          and over throughout the early to mid     s     the more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream pcs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment     since the turn of the millennium  the definition of  workstation  has blurred to some extent  many of the components used in lower end  workstations  are now the same as those used in the consumer market  and the price differential between the lower end workstation and consumer pcs can be narrower than it once was  and in certain cases in the high end consumer market  such as the  enthusiast  game market  it can be difficult to tell what qualifies as a  desktop pc  and a  workstation    in another instance  the nvidia geforce     graphics card spawned the quadro  which had the same gpu but different driver support and certifications tailored to the unique requirements of cad applications and retailed for a much higher price  so many took to using the geforce as a  poor man s  workstation card since the hardware was largely as capable plus it could be soft modded to unlock features nominally exclusive to the quadro      workstations have typically been the drivers of advancements in cpu technology  although both the consumer desktop and the workstation benefit from cpus designed around the multicore concept  essentially  multiple processors on a die  the application of which ibm s power  was a pioneer   modern workstations typically use multiple multicore cpus  error correcting memory and much larger on die caches than those found on  consumer level  cpus  such power and reliability are not normally required on a general desktop computer  ibm s power based processor boards and the workstation level intel based xeon processor boards  for example  have multiple cpus  more on die cache and ecc memory  which are features more suited to demanding content creation  engineering and scientific work than to general desktop computing     some workstations are designed for use with only one specific application such as autocad  avid xpress studio hd   d studio max  etc  to ensure compatibility with the software  purchasers usually ask for a certificate from the software vendor  the certification process makes the workstation s price jump several notches but for professional purposes  reliability is more important than the initial purchase cost     as of january       all risc based workstation product lines have been discontinued     the current workstation market uses x      microprocessors  operating systems available for these platforms include ms windows  freebsd  the different gnu linux distributions  apple mac os x  and oracle solaris  some vendors also market commodity mono socket systems as workstations     three types of products are marketed under the workstation umbrella     a significant segment of the desktop market are computers expected to perform as workstations  but using pc operating systems and components  component manufacturers will often segment their product line  and market premium components which are functionally similar to the cheaper  consumer  models but feature a higher level of robustness and or performance     a workstation class pc may have some of the following features     this article is based on material taken from the free on line dictionary of computing prior to
