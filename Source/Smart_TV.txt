 a smart tv  sometimes referred to as connected tv or hybrid tv  is a television set or set top box with integrated internet and web     features  and is an example of technological convergence between computers and television sets and set top boxes  besides the traditional functions of television sets and set top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media  these devices can also provide internet tv  online interactive media  over the top content  as well as on demand streaming media  and home networking access         smart tv should not to be confused with internet tv  iptv or with web tv  internet tv refers to the receiving television content over internet instead of traditional systems  terrestrial  cable and satellite   although internet itself is received by these methods   internet protocol television  iptv  is one of the emerging internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters  web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on internet tv     in smart tvs  the operating system is preloaded or is available through set top box  the software applications or apps can be preloaded into the device  or updated or installed on demand via an app store or app marketplace  in a similar manner to how the apps are integrated in modern smartphones          the technology that enables smart tvs is also incorporated in external devices such as set top boxes  blu ray players  game consoles  digital media players  hotel television systems  and other network connected interactive devices that utilize television type display outputs        these devices allow viewers to search  find and play videos  movies  photos and other content from the web  on a cable tv channel  on a satellite tv channel  or on a local storage drive               a first patent was filed in         and extended the following year    for an  intelligent  television system  linked with data processing systems  by means of a digital or analog network  apart from being linked to data networks  one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines  according to a user s demand  and process their needs     the mass acceptance of digital television in late     s and early     s greatly improved smart tvs  major tv manufacturers have announced production of smart tvs only  for their middle end to high end tvs in               smart tvs are expected to become dominant form of television by late     s     a smart tv device is either a television set with integrated internet capabilities or a set top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set  smart tvs may be thought of as an information appliance or the computer system from a handheld computer integrated within a television set unit  as such smart tv often allows the user to install and run more advanced applications or plugins addons based on a specific platform  smart tvs run complete operating system or mobile operating system software providing a platform for application developers                  smart tv platforms or middleware have a public software development kit  sdk  and or native development kit  ndk  for apps so that third party developers can develop applications for it  and an app store so that the end users can install and uninstall apps themselves  the public sdk enables third party companies and other interactive application developers to  write  applications once and see them run successfully on any device that supports the smart tv platform or middleware architecture which it was written for  no matter who the hardware manufacturer is     smart tvs deliver content  such as photos  movies and music  from other computers or network attached storage devices on a network using either a digital living network alliance   universal plug and play media server or similar service program like windows media player or network attached storage  nas   or via itunes  it also provides access to internet based services including traditional broadcast tv channels  catch up services  video on demand  vod   electronic program guide  interactive advertising  personalisation  voting  games  social networking  and other multimedia applications           smart tv devices also provide access to user generated content  either stored on an external hard drive or in cloud storage  and to interactive services and internet applications  such as youtube  many using http live streaming  also known as hls  adaptive streaming       smart tv devices facilitate the curation of traditional content by combining information from the internet with content from tv providers  services offer users a means to track and receive reminders about shows   or sporting events    as well as the ability to change channels for immediate viewing     some devices feature additional interactive organic user interface   natural user interface technologies for navigation controls and other human interaction with a smart tv  with such as second screen companion devices      spatial gestures input like with xbox kinect        and even for speech recognition for natural language user interface       smart tv technology and software is still evolving  with both proprietary and open source software frameworks already available  these can run applications  sometimes available via an  app store  digital distribution platform   interactive on demand media  personalized communications  and have social networking features               some smart tv platforms come prepackaged  or can be optionally extended  with social networking technology capabilities  the addition of social networking synchronization to smart tv and htpc platforms may provide an interaction with both on screen content and other viewers than is currently available to most televisions  while simultaneously providing a much more cinematic experience of the content than is currently available with most computers       some smart tv platforms also support interactive advertising  addressable advertising with local advertising insertion and targeted advertising    and other advanced advertising features such as ad telescoping   using vod and pvr  enhanced tv for consumer call to action and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness      taken together  this bidirectional data flow means that smart tvs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners    even in sets that are not configured off the shelf to do so  default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the tv       there is evidence that a smart tv is vulnerable to attacks  some bugs very discovered accidentally  some successful attempts to run malicious code to get unauthorized access were documented on video  there is evidence that it is possible to gain root access to the device  install malicious software  access and modify configuration information for a remote control  remotely access and modify files on tv and attached usb drives  access camera and microphone  anticipating growing demand for an antivirus for a smart tv  some security software companies are already working with partners in digital tv field on the solution  at this moment it seems like there is only one antivirus for smart tvs available  ocean blue software partnered with sophos and developed first cloud based antimalware system  neptune   also antivirus company avira has joined forces with digital tv testing company labwise to work on the software that would protect against potential attacks        internet websites can block smart tv access to content at will  or tailor the content that will be received by each platform       google tv enabled devices were blocked by nbc  abc  cbs  and hulu from accessing their web content since the launch of google tv in october         google tv devices were also blocked from accessing any programs offered by viacom s subsidiaries       the privacy policy for samsung s smart tvs has been called orwellian  and compared to telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns         according to a report from the researcher npd in stat  only about    million u s  households have their web capable tvs connected to the internet  although in stat estimates about    million u s  tv households own a set with the built in network capability  also  in stat predicts that     million homes in north america and western europe will own television sets that blend traditional programs with internet content by
