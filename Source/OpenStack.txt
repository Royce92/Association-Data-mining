 openstack is a free and open source cloud computing software platform   users primarily deploy it as an infrastructure as a service  iaas  solution  the technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that control pools of processing  storage  and networking resources throughout a data center which users manage through a web based dashboard  command line tools  or a restful api  openstack org released it under the terms of the apache license     openstack began in      as a joint project of rackspace hosting and nasa  currently  it is managed by the openstack foundation  a non profit corporate entity established in september       to promote openstack software and its community   more than     companies have joined the project  including arista networks  at t  amd  avaya  canonical  cisco  dell  emc  ericsson  go daddy  hewlett packard  huawei  ibm  intel  internap  juniper networks  mellanox  mirantis  nec  netapp  nexenta  oracle  plumgrid  pure storage  qosmos  red hat  solidfire  suse linux  vmware  vmturbo and yahoo               the openstack community collaborates around a six month  time based release cycle with frequent development milestones    during the planning phase of each release  the community gathers for the openstack design summit to facilitate developer working sessions and to assemble plans       the most recent openstack summit was held in paris in november         the previous summit in may      in atlanta drew       attendees   a     increase from the hong kong summit six months earlier                 in july       rackspace hosting and nasa jointly launched an open source cloud software initiative known as openstack  the openstack project intended to help organizations offer cloud computing services running on standard hardware  the community s first official release  code named austin  appeared four months later  with plans to release regular updates of the software every few months  the early code came from nasa s nebula platform as well as from rackspace s cloud files platform     in       developers of the ubuntu linux distribution adopted openstack   with an unsupported technology preview of the openstack  bexar  release for ubuntu        natty narwhal     ubuntu s sponsor canonical then introduced full support for openstack clouds  starting with openstack s cactus release     openstack became available in debian sid from the openstack  cactus  release in       and the first release of debian including openstack was debian      code name  wheezy    including openstack         code name   essex           in       red hat announced a preview of their openstack distribution    beginning with the  essex  release  after another preview release  red hat introduced commercial support for openstack with the  grizzly  release  in july            in july       nasa released an internal audit citing lack of technical progress and other factors as the agency s primary reason for dropping out as an active developer of the project and instead focus on the use of public clouds       in may       hp announced hp helion and released a preview of hp helion openstack community  beginning with the icehouse release  hp has operated hp helion public cloud on openstack since            openstack has a modular architecture with various code names for its components       openstack compute  nova  is a cloud computing fabric controller  which is the main part of an iaas system  it is designed to manage and automate pools of computer resources and can work with widely available virtualization technologies  as well as bare metal and high performance computing  hpc  configurations  kvm  vmware  and xen are available choices for hypervisor technology  together with hyper v and linux container technology such as lxc         it is written in python and uses many external libraries such as eventlet  for concurrent programming   kombu  for amqp communication   and sqlalchemy  for database access     compute s architecture is designed to scale horizontally on standard hardware with no proprietary hardware or software requirements and provide the ability to integrate with legacy systems and third party technologies     openstack object storage  swift  is a scalable redundant storage system  objects and files are written to multiple disk drives spread throughout servers in the data center  with the openstack software responsible for ensuring data replication and integrity across the cluster  storage clusters scale horizontally simply by adding new servers  should a server or hard drive fail  openstack replicates its content from other active nodes to new locations in the cluster  because openstack uses software logic to ensure data replication and distribution across different devices  inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used     in august       rackspace started the development of the precursor to openstack object storage  as a complete replacement for the cloud files product  the initial development team consisted of nine developers    swiftstack  an object storage software company  is currently the leading developer for swift citation needed    openstack block storage  cinder  provides persistent block level storage devices for use with openstack compute instances  the block storage system manages the creation  attaching and detaching of the block devices to servers  block storage volumes are fully integrated into openstack compute and the dashboard allowing for cloud users to manage their own storage needs  in addition to local linux server storage  it can use storage platforms including ceph  cloudbyte  coraid  emc  scaleio  vmax and vnx   glusterfs  hitachi data systems  ibm storage  storwize family  san volume controller  xiv storage system  and gpfs   linux lio  netapp  nexenta  scality  solidfire  hp  storevirtual and  par storeserv families  and pure storage  block storage is appropriate for performance sensitive scenarios such as database storage  expandable file systems  or providing a server with access to raw block level storage  snapshot management provides powerful functionality for backing up data stored on block storage volumes  snapshots can be restored or used to create a new block storage volume     openstack networking  neutron  formerly quantum    is a system for managing networks and ip addresses  openstack networking ensures the network is not a bottleneck or limiting factor in a cloud deployment  and gives users self service ability  even over network configurations     openstack networking provides networking models for different applications or user groups  standard models include flat networks or vlans that separate servers and traffic  openstack networking manages ip addresses  allowing for dedicated static ip addresses or dhcp  floating ip addresses let traffic be dynamically rerouted to any resources in the it infrastructure  so users can redirect traffic during maintenance or in case of a failure     users can create their own networks  control traffic  and connect servers and devices to one or more networks  administrators can use software defined networking  sdn  technology like openflow to support high levels of multi tenancy and massive scale  openstack networking provides an extension framework that can deploy and manage additional network services such as intrusion detection systems  ids   load balancing  firewalls  and virtual private networks  vpn      openstack dashboard  horizon  provides administrators and users a graphical interface to access  provision  and automate cloud based resources  the design accommodates third party products and services  such as billing  monitoring  and additional management tools  the dashboard is also brandable for service providers and other commercial vendors who want to make use of it  the dashboard is one of several ways users can interact with openstack resources  developers can automate access or build tools to manage resources using the native openstack api or the ec  compatibility api     openstack identity  keystone  provides a central directory of users mapped to the openstack services they can access  it acts as a common authentication system across the cloud operating system and can integrate with existing backend directory services like ldap  it supports multiple forms of authentication including standard username and password credentials  token based systems and aws style  i e  amazon web services  logins  additionally  the catalog provides a queryable list of all of the services deployed in an openstack cloud in a single registry  users and third party tools can programmatically determine which resources they can access     openstack image service  glance  provides discovery  registration  and delivery services for disk and server images  stored images can be used as a template  it can also be used to store and catalog an unlimited number of backups  the image service can store disk and server images in a variety of back ends  including openstack object storage  the image service api provides a standard rest interface for querying information about disk images and lets clients stream the images to new servers     openstack org updates glance every six months  along with other openstack modules  some of the updates are to catch up with existing cloud infrastructure services  as openstack is comparatively new  glance adds many enhancements to existing legacy infrastructures  for example  if integrated with vmware  glance introduces advanced features to the vsphere family such as  vmotion  high availability and dynamic resource scheduling  drs   vmotion is the live migration of a running vm  from one physical server to another  without service interruption  thus  it enables a dynamic and automated self optimizing datacenter  allowing hardware maintenance for the underperforming servers without downtimes         openstack s image is an operating system installed on a virtual machine  vm   if a developer adds a variation to an image  as a configuration job  the result is an instance of that image  subsequently  that instance is an image that developers can add more variations to     glance openstack s image service module is a compute module  as it does not store images  variations  or instances but rather catalogs them and holds their metadata from swift or a storage backend datastore  other modules must communicate with the images metadata through glance for example  heat  also  nova can present information about the images  and configure a variation on an image to produce an instance  however  glance is the only module that can add  delete  share  or duplicate images       openstack telemetry service  ceilometer  provides a single point of contact for billing systems  providing all the counters they need to establish customer billing  across all current and future openstack components  the delivery of counters is traceable and auditable  the counters must be easily extensible to support new projects  and agents doing data collections should be independent of the overall system     heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using templates  through both an openstack native rest api and a cloudformation compatible query api       trove is a database as a service provisioning relational and non relational database engines       ironic is an incubated openstack project that aims to provision bare metal machines instead of virtual machines  it was initially forked from the nova baremetal driver and has evolved into a separate program  it is best thought of as a bare metal hypervisor api and a set of plugins that interact with the bare metal hypervisors  by default  it will use pxe and ipmi in concert to provision and turn on and off machines  but ironic supports and can be extended with vendor specific plugins to implement additional functionality         zaqar is a multi tenant cloud messaging service for web developers  it combines the ideas pioneered by amazon s sqs product with additional semantics to support event broadcasting  the service features a fully restful api  which developers can use to send messages between various components of their saas and mobile applications by using a variety of communication patterns  underlying this api is an efficient messaging engine designed with scalability and security in mind  other openstack components can integrate with zaqar to surface events to end users and to communicate with guest agents that run in the  over cloud  layer  cloud operators can leverage zaqar to provide equivalents of sqs and sns to their customers  zaqar was formerly known as marconi         sahara aims to provide users with simple means to provision hadoop clusters by specifying several parameters like hadoop version  cluster topology  nodes hardware details and a few more  after a user fills all the parameters  sahara deploys the cluster in a few minutes  sahara also provides means to scale an already provisioned cluster by adding and removing worker nodes on demand         openstack apis are compatible with amazon ec  and amazon s  and thus client applications written for amazon web services can be used with openstack with minimal porting effort         openstack is governed by a non profit foundation and its board of directors  a technical committee and a user committee  the board of directors is made up of eight members from each of the eight platinum sponsors  eight members from the    defined maximum allowed gold sponsors  and eight members elected by the foundation individual members       the current sitting board of directors is       the foundation s stated mission is by providing shared resources to help achieve the openstack mission by protecting  empowering  and promoting openstack software and the community around it  including users  developers and the entire ecosystem  though  it has little to do with the development of the software  which is managed by the technical committee   an elected group that represents the contributors to the project  and has oversight on all technical matters       openstack has a wide variety of users  from a number of different sectors    notable users include     as the openstack project has matured  vendors have pioneered multiple ways for customers to deploy openstack
