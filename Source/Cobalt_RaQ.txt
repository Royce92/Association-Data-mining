 the cobalt raq is a  u rackmount server product line developed by cobalt networks  inc   later purchased by sun microsystems  featuring a modified red hat linux operating system and a proprietary gui for server management  the original raq systems were equipped with rm     or rm     cpus but later models used amd k    chips and then eventually intel pentium iii cpus for the final models     the cobalt raq was the second product line produced by cobalt networks  the first was the cobalt qube     below is a list of cobalt raq types  and their specs        xa mhz or  xa ghz  re release     under an oem arrangement  raq   units were also produced by seagate  in the form of the seagate nasraq     there were variants of the raq   and raq   models known as the raq  i or raq  i  scsi support  two ethernet connectors  pci connector   and the raq  r  scsi support  two ethernet connectors  and raid   raid on these models was accomplished in software using a second ide channel on the motherboard for the second hard drive  there was also a  bare bones  raq   model that had a single ethernet adapter  no external scsi  and a single hard drive     the raq   shipped with chili soft asp support  cobalt acquired chili soft a few months prior to being acquired by sun     the raq   added php support to the raq   payload     the raq xtr was the first  u server to have four removable hard drives  unfortunately  the first release was plagued with hardware problems and was recalled  this happened during the cobalt acquisition  and it took over   months to get the xtr re released  it was never a big seller  the xtr ui was also a  hybrid  between the newer php based sausalito system and the older perl based  special sauce  that powered the raq     raq       symantec s veloci raptor firewall appliances were also based on the raq xtr hardware  these systems were equipped with an additional   port network card  together with the two onboard network cards the system had four network interfaces     the raq     was the final appliance from the cobalt division  it added java support to the raq   payload  and was the first raq to use only the sausalito ui originated in the qube       not long after the cobalt acquisition  sun terminated the cobalt product  announcing the cobalt range end of life  eol   sun also announced it would discontinue all support and upgrades on the raq  raq  and xtr  and will stop offering these services for the raq    and qube  in the end of          on december           sun released the raq    sausalito source code under the bsd license  ever since developers have tried to keep the cobalt project alive  examples are bluequartz  maintained by a group of japanese fans  blueonyx maintained by former cobalt raq consultants and rackstar  an initiative of raqtweak  cobalt raq consultants  and several ex sun cobalt engineers such as tim hockin and patrick baltz     the installation of a standard linux distribution on the newer x   based raqs is possible  the installation of a newer kernel     based distribution requires either the replacement of the rom software  the raq does not have a typical bios   or to use chain loading  colo can be used for this purpose
