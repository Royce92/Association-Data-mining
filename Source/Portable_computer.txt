 a portable computer is a computer that is designed to be moved from one place to another and includes a display and keyboard  portable computers  by their nature  are generally microcomputers   portable computers  because of their size  are also commonly known as  lunchbox  or  luggable  computers  they can also be called a  portable workstation  or  portable pc      these are distinct from desktop replacement computers in that they are usually constructed from full specification desktop components  and do not incorporate features associated with laptops or mobile devices  the principal advantage of a portable computer versus a laptop or other mobile computing device is the use of standard motherboards or backplanes providing plug in slots for add in cards  this allows mission specific cards such as test  a d  or communication protocol  ieee            to be installed  portable computers also provide for more disk storage by using standard        drives and providing for multiple drives             in      the ibm palo alto scientific center developed a portable computer prototype called scamp  special computer apl machine portable  based on the ibm palm processor with a philips compact cassette drive  small crt and full function keyboard  scamp emulated an ibm      minicomputer in order to run apl       in      apl was generally available only on mainframe computers  and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the wang      or hp      offered only basic  because scamp was the first to emulate apl     performance on a portable  single user computer  pc magazine in      designated scamp a  revolutionary concept  and  the world s first personal computer        successful demonstrations of the      scamp prototype led to the first commercial ibm      portable microcomputer launched in       the product incorporated an ibm palm processor    inch crt  full function keyboard and the ability to be programmed in both apl and basic for engineers  analysts  statisticians and other business problem solvers  ibm referred to its palm processor as a microprocessor  though they used that term to mean a processor that executes microcode to implement a higher level instruction set  rather than its conventional definition of a complete processor on a single silicon integrated circuit  in the late     s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton      the mit suitcase computer  constructed in       was the first known microprocessor based portable computer  it was based on the motorola       constructed in a samsonite suitcase approximately    x   x   and weighing approximately   xa lbs   it had  k of sram  a serial port to accept downloaded software and connect to a modem  a keyboard and a    column thermal printer taken from a cash register  built by student david emberson in the mit digital systems laboratory as a thesis project  it never entered production  it is currently in the collection of dr  hoo min d  toong     xerox notetaker  developed in      at xerox parc  was a precursor to later portable computers from osborne computer corporation and compaq  though it remained a prototype and did not enter production     an early portable computer was manufactured in      by gm research   a small company in santa monica  california  the machine which was designed and patented by james murez  it was called the micro star and later changed the name to the small one  although xerox claims to have designed the first such system  the machine by murez predated anything on the market or that had been documented in any publication at the time   hence the patent was issued  as early as      the u s  government was contracting to purchase these machines  other major customers included sandia labs  general dynamics  bbn  featured on the cover of their annual report in      as the c a t  system  and several dozen private individuals and companies around the world  in       adam osborne viewed the machine along with several hundred other visitors at the first computer show that was sponsored by the ieee westec in los angeles  later that year the machine was also shown at the first comdex show     the first mass produced microprocessor based portable computer was the osborne    developed by osborne  which owed much to the notetaker s design     another early portable computer released in      was the kaypro     in january       the first ibm pc compatible portable computer  and indeed the first      ibm pc compatible  or  clone   of any kind  was the compaq portable     the first full color portable computer was the commodore sx    in january          apple inc  introduced a portable apple iic in april       but would not release a macintosh portable until       though the original macintosh was by its compact design  practically a portable     smaller portable computers are also known as mobile computers  they are referred to by their more specific terms     portable computers have been increasing in popularity over the past decade  as they do not restrict the user in terms of mobility as a desktop computer would  wireless access to the internet  extended battery life and more comfortable ergonomics have been factors driving this increase in popularity  all in one pcs such as the imac can also be considered portable computers and often have handles built into the case
