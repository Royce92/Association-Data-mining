ultimately cancelled    in       microsoft reorganized the windows mobile group and started work on a new mobile operating system    the product was to be released in      as windows phone  but several delays prompted microsoft to develop windows mobile     as an interim release       windows phone was developed quickly  one result was that the new os would not be compatible with windows mobile applications  larry lieberman  senior product manager for microsoft s mobile developer experience  told eweek   if we d had more time and resources  we may have been able to do something in terms of backward compatibility     lieberman said that microsoft was attempting to look at the mobile phone market in a new way  with the end user in mind as well as the enterprise network    terry myerson  corporate vp of windows phone engineering  said   with the move to capacitive touch screens  away from the stylus  and the moves to some of the hardware choices we made for the windows phone   experience  we had to break application compatibility with windows mobile            windows phone   was announced at mobile world congress in barcelona  catalonia  spain  on february           and released publicly on november         in the united states     in      microsoft released windows phone     mango  the update included a mobile version of internet explorer   that supports the same

on arm architecture  its primary focus is unification with its pc counterpart in software and services  in accordance with this unification strategy  microsoft began to phase out the windows phone brand from public usage in favor of using the  windows     brand across all device classes  for instance  the microsoft store refers to smartphones that can be upgraded to the os as being  windows    ready   rather than using the name  windows phone              microsoft has downplayed specific references to the windows phone brand in relation to it  however  critics have still considered the operating system to be an iteration and continuation of windows phone due to its lineage and similar overall functionality           on february           at a press event in london  microsoft ceo steve ballmer and nokia ceo stephen elop announced a partnership between their companies in which windows phone would become the primary smartphone operating system for nokia  replacing symbian    the event focused largely on setting up  a new global mobile ecosystem   suggesting competition with android and ios with the words  it is now a three horse race   elop s stated the reason for choosing windows phone over android  saying   the single most important word is  differentiation   entering the android environment late  we knew we would have a hard time differentiating     while nokia would have had more long term creative control with android  note that meego as used by nokia resembles android more than it does windows phone   as both android and meego are based on the linux kernel   elop enjoyed familiarity with his past company where he had been a top executive         the pair announced integration of microsoft services with nokia s own services  specifically       the partnership involves  funds changing hands for royalties  marketing and ad revenue sharing   which microsoft later announced as  measured in billions of dollars     jo harlow  whom elop tapped to run nokia s smartphone business  rearranged her team to match the structure led by microsoft s vp of windows phone  terry myerson  myerson was quoted as saying   i can trust her with what she tells me  she uses that same direct and genuine communication to motivate her team        the first nokia lumia windows phones  the lumia     and lumia      were announced in october      at nokia world              at the consumer electronics show in      nokia announced the lumia      featuring a     inch amoled clearblack display  a    xa ghz processor and   xa gb of storage    the lumia     was one of

windows phone to run the tango variant  windows phone     refresh  and is aimed at emerging markets     on september          microsoft announced a deal to acquire nokia s mobile phone division outright  retaining former ceo stephen elop as the head of microsoft s devices operation      microsoft managers revealed that the acquisition was made because nokia was driving the development of the windows phone platform to better match their products    the merger was completed after regulatory approval in all major markets in april       as a result  nokia s hardware division is now a subsidiary of microsoft operating under the name microsoft mobile     in february       nokia released the nokia x series of smartphones  using a version of android forked from the android open source project  the operating system was modified  google s software was not included in favour of competing applications and services from microsoft and nokia  with a user interface is highly modified to resemble windows phone       windows phone features a user interface based on microsoft s  metro  design language    and was inspired by the user interface in the zune hd    the home screen  called the  start screen   is made up of  live tiles   which have been the inspiration for the windows   live tiles  tiles are links to applications  features  functions and individual items  such as contacts  web pages  applications or media items   users can add  rearrange  or remove tiles    tiles are dynamic and update in real time   for example  the tile for an email account would display the number of unread messages or a tile could display a live update of the weather    since windows phone    live tiles can also be resized to either a small  medium  or large appearance     several features of windows phone are organized into  hubs   which combine local and online content via windows phone s integration with popular social networks such as facebook  windows live  and twitter

emit light  alternatively  users may choose a light theme in their phone s settings menu    light theme has white background which is more energy efficient on lcd as white pixels are actually transparent and do not required energy  the user may also choose from several accent colors    user interface elements such as links  buttons and tiles are shown in the user s chosen accent color  third party applications can be automatically themed with these colors    windows phone     introduces transparent tiles and a customizable background image for the start screen  the image is visible trough the transparent area of the tiles and features a parallax effect when scrolling which gives an illusion of depth  if the user does not pick a background image the tiles render with the accent color of the theme     users input text by using an on screen virtual keyboard  which has a dedicated key for inserting emoticons    and features spell checking   and word prediction    app developers  both inhouse and isv  may specify different versions of the virtual keyboard in order to limit users to certain character sets  such as numeric characters alone  users may change a word after it has been typed by tapping the word    which will invoke a list of similar words  pressing and holding certain keys will reveal similar characters  the keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in landscape mode  phones may also be made with a hardware keyboard for text input    users can also add accents to letters by holding on an individual letter  windows phone     introduces a new method of typing by swiping trough the keyboard without lifting the finger  in a manner similar to swype and swiftkey     internet explorer on windows phone allows the user to maintain a list of

out animations  the ability to save pictures that are on web pages  share web pages via email  and support for inline search which allows the user to search for a word or phrase in a web page by typing it    tabs are synced with windows     devices using internet explorer        contacts are organized via the  people hub   and can be manually entered into contacts or imported from facebook  windows live contacts  twitter  linkedin  google  and outlook  a  what s new  section shows a user s facebook news feed and a  pictures  section show pictures from those social networks  while a  me

tile  displays their social network status and profile picture on the homescreen  clicking on a contact s tile or accessing their card within the  people  hub will reveal their recent social network activity as well as the rest of their contact information     if a contact has information stored on multiple networks  users can link the two separate contact accounts  allowing the information to be viewed and accessed from a single card    as of windows phone      contacts can also be sorted into  groups   here  information from each of the contacts is combined into a single page which can be accessed directly from the hub or pinned to the start screen     windows phone supports outlook com  exchange  yahoo  mail and gmail natively and supports many other services via the pop and imap protocols  updates added support for more services such as icloud and ibm notes traveler  contacts and calendars may be synced from these services as well  users can also search through their email by searching in the subject  body  senders  and receivers  emails are shown with threads  and multiple email inboxes can be combined into a single view  a feature commonly referred to as  combined inbox   or can viewed separately     xbox music and xbox video are built in multimedia hubs providing entertainment and synchronization capabilities between pc  windows phone  and other microsoft products    the two hubs were previously combined until standalone apps were released in late       shortly before windows phone     debuted    the hubs allow users to access music  videos  and podcasts stored on the device  and links directly to the  xbox music store  to buy or rent music and the  xbox video store  to purchase movies and tv episodes  xbox music also allows the user to stream music with an

multiplayer games    games are downloaded from windows phone store     bing is the default search engine on windows phone handsets because its functions are deeply integrated in the os  which also include the utilization of its map service for location based searches and queries   however  microsoft has stated that other search engine applications can be used         in the area of location

file transfer between windows phones  and nfc compatible devices through nfc     software updates are delivered to windows phone users via microsoft update  as is the case with other windows operating systems    microsoft initially had the intention to directly update any phone running windows phone instead of relying on oems or wireless carriers    but on january          microsoft changed their policy to let carriers decide if an update will be delivered       while windows phone   users were required to attach their phones to a pc to install updates    starting with windows phone    all updates are done via over the air downloads    since windows phone    microsoft has also begun releasing minor updates that add features to a current os release throughout the year    these updates

xna  a windows phone specific version of silverlight  the gui based windows phone app studio  or the windows runtime  which allows developers to develop an app for the both the windows store and windows phone store simultaneously        app developers can develop apps using c    visual basic net   net   c    cx  or html  javascript     for windows phone apps to be designed and tested within

this  along with support for native c and c   libraries  allows some traditional windows desktop programs to be easily ported to windows phone       registered windows phone and xbox live developers can submit and manage their third party applications for the platforms through the app hub web applications  the app hub provides development tools and support for third party application developers  the submitted applications undergo an approval process for verifications and validations to check if they qualify the applications standardization criteria set by microsoft    the cost of the applications that are approved is up to the developer  but microsoft will take     of the revenue  the other     goes to the developer     microsoft will only pay developers once they reach a set

the metro ui and overall interface of the os has also been highly praised for its stylecitation needed  with zdnet noting its originality and fresh clean look     engadget and zdnet applauded the integration of facebook into the people hub as well as other built in capabilities  such as windows live  etc  however in version     the once tight facebook and twitter integration has been removed so that updates from those social media sites must be accessed via their respective apps            according to gartner  there were     million devices running microsoft os sold to customers in q       worldwide         million smartphones using a microsoft mobile os were sold in q        for a      market share     in q        microsoft s world wide market share dropped slightly to          in q       market share increased to          and it stayed at      for q           however it should be noted that such reports for q   q  and q  of year      include both windows phone and small part of windows mobile marketshare under the same  microsoft mobile os  banner  and do not make the distinction of separating the marketshare values of the two  according to nielsen  windows phone had a      market share in q           and then dropped back to      in q              after the release of windows phone    gartner reported that windows phone s marketshare jumped to    in q        a      increase over the same time period in             in mid       idc had suggested that windows phone might surpass the faltering blackberry platform and potentially even apple ios  because of nokia dominance in emerging markets like asia  latin america  and africa  as the iphone was considered too expensive for most of these regions and blackberry os possibly going to feature a similar fate as symbian        idc s projections were partially correct  as in q       windows phone shipments have surpassed blackberry shipment volume for the first time     idc had to slash the windows phone predictions once again  to   percent of total market in       because of the slow growth        as of the third quarter of       gartner reported that windows phone holds a worldwide market share of       up      from the same period in      and outpacing android s rate of growth     according to kantar s october      report  windows phone accounts for       of all smartphone sales in europe and      of all sales in the united states     some analysts have attributed this spike in sales to both windows phone   and nokia s successful push to market low and mid range windows phones like the lumia     and lumia     to a younger audience        gartner reported that windows phone market share finished      at       which while down from the third quarter of      was still a       improvement from the same period in             idc reported that windows phone market share  having peaked in      at       had dropped to      by the second quarter of             htc was originally making up most of windows phone s sales  holding     of the market in january       however  nokia came from behind  overtaking samsung in february      and htc a month later  and held a total of     share in may that year because of the popularity of the lumia range  with the release of lumia devices running windows phone    nokia reached     of windows phone s installed base in february       at the same time  htc s share dropped to            as of october           nokia now makes up a dominating       windows phone market share worldwide  according to adduplex  htc has a      share     microsoft s developer initiative programs and marketing have gained attention from application developers  as of q        an average of     of mobile developers use the windows phone platform  with another     stating they are interested in adopting it     some reports have indicated that developers may be less interested in developing for windows phone because of lower ad revenue when compared to competing platforms     the verge reported that microsoft is considering bringing android applications to the windows phone and desktop platforms as a way of boosting this smaller app portfolio  although this report has not been confirmed by microsoft     the main criticism of windows phone is still the lack of applications when compared to ios and android
