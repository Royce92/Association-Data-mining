 solar power is the conversion of sunlight into electricity  either directly using photovoltaics  pv   or indirectly using concentrated solar power  csp   concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  photovoltaics convert light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect      photovoltaics were initially  and still are  used to power small and medium sized applications  from the calculator powered by a single solar cell to off grid homes powered by a photovoltaic array  they are an important and relatively inexpensive source of electrical energy where grid power is inconvenient  unreasonably expensive to connect  or simply unavailable  however  as the cost of solar electricity is falling  solar power is also increasingly being used even in grid connected situations as a way to feed low carbon energy into the grid     commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the     s  the     mw ivanpah installation is the largest concentrating solar power plant in the world  located in the mojave desert of california  other large csp plants include the segs      mw  in the mojave desert of california  the solnova solar power station      mw  and the andasol solar power station      mw   both in spain  the two     mw solar farms  topaz solar farm and desert sunlight solar farm in the united states  are the world s largest photovoltaic power stations                 a solar cell  or photovoltaic cell  pv   is a device that converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect  the first solar cell was constructed by charles fritts in the     s   the german industrialist ernst werner von siemens was among those who recognized the importance of this discovery   in       the german engineer bruno lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide   although the prototype selenium cells converted less than    of incident light into electricity  following the work of russell ohl in the     s  researchers gerald pearson  calvin fuller and daryl chapin created the silicon solar cell in        these early solar cells cost    xa usd watt and reached efficiencies of             the array of a photovoltaic power system  or pv system  produces direct current  dc  power which fluctuates with the sunlight s intensity  for practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current  ac   through the use of inverters   multiple solar cells are connected inside modules  modules are wired together to form arrays  then tied to an inverter  which produces power at the desired voltage  and for ac  the desired frequency phase      many residential pv systems are connected to the grid wherever available  especially in developed countries with large markets   in these grid connected pv systems  use of energy storage is optional  in certain applications such as satellites  lighthouses  or in developing countries  batteries or additional power generators are often added as back ups  such stand alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight     concentrating solar power  csp  systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  the concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant  a wide range of concentrating technologies exists  among the best known are the parabolic trough  the compact linear fresnel reflector  the stirling dish and the solar power tower  various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light  in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight  and is then used for power generation or energy storage   thermal storage efficiently allows up to    hour electricity generation       a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector s focal line  the receiver is a tube positioned right above the middle of the parabolic mirror and is filled with a working fluid  the reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis  parabolic trough systems provide the best land use factor of any solar technology    the segs plants in california and acciona s nevada solar one near boulder city  nevada are representatives of this technology         compact linear fresnel reflectors are csp plants which use many thin mirror strips instead of parabolic mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid  this has the advantage that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors  and that more reflectors can be placed in the same amount of space  allowing more of the available sunlight to be used  concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants         the stirling solar dish combines a parabolic concentrating dish with a stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator  the advantages of stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime  parabolic dish systems give the highest efficiency among csp technologies    the   xa kw big dish in canberra  australia is an example of this technology       a solar power tower uses an array of tracking reflectors  heliostats  to concentrate light on a central receiver atop a tower  power towers are more cost effective  offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability among csp technologies    the ps   solar power plant and ps   solar power plant are examples of this technology     xa xa xa xa xa solar pvxa xa xa  xa xa xa xa xa csp   solar thermal    the early development of solar technologies starting in the     s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce  however  development of solar technologies stagnated in the early   thxa century in the face of the increasing availability  economy  and utility of coal and petroleum    in      it was estimated that only six private homes in all of north america were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems    the      oil embargo and      energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies      deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the federal photovoltaic utilization program in the us and the sunshine program in japan  other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the united states  seri  now nrel   japan  nedo   and germany  fraunhofer ise     between      and      installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly  but falling oil prices in the early     s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from      to          in the mid     s  development of both  residential and commercial rooftop solar as well as utility scale photovoltaic power stations  began to accelerate again due to supply issues with oil and natural gas  global warming concerns  and the improving economic position of pv relative to other energy technologies    in the early     s  the adoption of feed in tariffs a policy mechanism  that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity lead to a high level of investment security and to a soaring number of pv deployment in europe     for several years  worldwide growth of solar pv was driven by european deployment  but has since shifted to asia  especially china and japan  and to a growing number of countries and regions all over the world  including  but not limited to  australia  canada  chile  india  israel  mexico  south africa  south korea  thailand  and the united states     worldwide growth of photovoltaics has averaged     per year since      and total installed capacity reached    xa gw at the end of      with germany having the most cumulative installations      xa gw  and italy having the highest percentage of electricity generated by solar pv              concentrated solar power  csp  also started to grow rapidly  increasing its capacity nearly tenfold from      to       albeit from a lower level and involving fewer countries than solar pv       as of the end of       worldwide cumulative csp capacity reached      xa mw     in       the international energy agency predicted that global solar pv capacity could reach       gw or     of projected global electricity generation by      enough to generate      xa twh of electricity    four years later  in       the agency reassessed their long term predictions  rising estimates for solar power to     of global electricity generation by           from pv and     from csp        there are also many large plants under construction  the desert sunlight solar farm is a    xa mw power plant under construction in riverside county  california  that will use thin film cdte modules made by first solar    the blythe solar power project is a    xa mw project under construction also in california  as of november       the     megawatt topaz solar farm is the largest photovoltaic power plant in the world     commercial concentrating solar thermal power  csp  plants were first developed in the     s  the    xa mw ivanpah solar power facility  located in california s mojave desert  is the world s largest solar thermal power plant project  other large csp plants include the solnova solar power station     xa mw   the andasol solar power station     xa mw   and extresol solar power station     xa mw   all in spain  the principal advantage of csp is the ability to efficiently add thermal storage  allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a    hour period  since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about  xa pm  many csp power plants use   to  xa hours of thermal storage       photovoltaic systems use no fuel and modules typically last    to    years  the cost of installation is almost the only cost  as there is very little maintenance required  installation cost is measured in   watt or   watt of peak power     as of       the cost per watt of pv has fallen well below that of nuclear power and is set to fall further  the average retail price of solar cells as monitored by the solarbuzz group fell from       watt to       watt over the course of       and a decline to prices below       watt seems inevitable       a u s  study of the amount of economic installations agrees closely with the actual installations     for large scale installations  prices below       watt are now common  in some locations  pv has reached grid parity  the cost at which it is competitive with coal or gas fired generation  more generally  it is now evident that  given a carbon price of     ton  which would raise the price of coal fired power by  c kwh  solar pv will be cost competitive in most locations  the declining price of pv has been reflected in rapidly growing installations  totalling about    gw in       although some consolidation is likely in       as firms try to restore profitability  strong growth seems likely to continue for the rest of the decade  already  by one estimate  total investment in renewables for      exceeded investment in carbon based electricity generation       additionally  governments have created various financial incentives to encourage the use of solar power  such as feed in tariff programs  also  renewable portfolio standards impose a government mandate that utilities generate or acquire a certain percentage of renewable power regardless of increased energy procurement costs  in most states  rps goals can be achieved by any combination of solar  wind  biomass  landfill gas  ocean  geothermal  municipal solid waste  hydroelectric  hydrogen  or fuel cell technologies       shi zhengrong has said that  as of       unsubsidised solar power is already competitive with fossil fuels in india  hawaii  italy and spain  he said  we are at a tipping point  no longer are renewable power sources like solar and wind a luxury of the rich  they are now starting to compete in the real world without subsidies    solar power will be able to compete without subsidies against conventional power sources in half the world by             the pv industry is beginning to adopt levelized cost of energy  lcoe  as the unit of cost  the electrical energy generated is sold in units of kwh    watt  peak  of installed photovoltaics generates roughly   to   kwh year  a capacity factor of around          dependent on the local insolation  the product of the local cost of electricity and the insolation determines the break even point for solar power  the international conference on solar photovoltaic investments  organized by epia  has estimated that pv systems will pay back their investors in   to    years    as a result  since      it has been economical for investors to install photovoltaics for free in return for a long term power purchase agreement  fifty percent of commercial systems were installed in this manner in      and over     by            the table below illustrates the calculated total cost in us cents per kilowatt hour of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system as function of the investment cost and the efficiency  assuming some accounting parameters such as cost of capital and depreciation period  the row headings on the left show the total cost  per peak kilowatt  kwp   of a photovoltaic installation  the column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kilowatt hours expected from each installed peak kilowatt  this varies by geographic region because the average insolation depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight  it also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon     for example a   xa mw plant in phoenix  az  the lcoe is estimated at       to      kwh in            panels can be mounted at an angle based on latitude    or solar tracking can be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight  thereby raising the total energy output  the calculated values in the table reflect the total cost in cents per kilowatt hour produced  they assume a    year total capital cost  for instance    interest rate     operating and maintenance cost  and depreciation of the capital outlay over    years      grid parity  the point at which the cost of photovoltaic electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power  is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in california and japan       the fully loaded cost  cost not price  of solar electricity in      was       kwh or less in most of the oecd countries  by late       the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below       kwh for most of the oecd and reach       kwh in sunnier regions  these cost levels are driving three emerging trends       grid parity was first reached in spain in         hawaii and other islands that otherwise use fossil fuel  diesel fuel  to produce electricity  and most of the us is expected to reach grid parity by              general electric s chief engineer predicted grid parity without subsidies in sunny parts of the united states by around       other companies predict an earlier date    the cost of solar power will be below grid parity for more than half of residential customers and     of commercial customers in the oecd  as long as grid electricity prices do not decrease through            in cases of self consumption of the solar energy  the payback time is calculated based on how much electricity is not purchased from the grid     for example  in germany  with electricity prices of      euro kwh and insolation of     kwh kw  one kwp will save     euro per year  and with an installation cost of      euro kwp the system cost will be returned in less than   years       however  in many cases  the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide  and some or all of the energy is fed back into the grid  the electricity is sold  and at other times when energy is taken from the grid  electricity is bought  the relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics     the political purpose of incentive policies for pv is to facilitate an initial small scale deployment to begin to grow the industry  even where the cost of pv is significantly above grid parity  to allow the industry to achieve the economies of scale necessary to reach grid parity  the policies are implemented to promote national energy independence  high tech job creation and reduction of co  emissions     three incentive mechanisms are used  often in combination      with investment subsidies  the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer  while with feed in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities  customer bases  while the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer  the main argument in favour of feed in tariffs is the encouragement of quality  investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time  thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance  some electric companies offer rebates to their customers  such as austin energy in texas  which offers       watt installed up to               in net metering the price of the electricity produced is the same as the price supplied to the consumer  and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption  net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters  which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference  and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption  effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery  with net metering  deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month  best practices call for perpetual roll over of kwh credits    excess credits upon termination of service are either lost  or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above  as can be excess annual credits  in new jersey  annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate  as are left over credits when a customer terminates service       with feed in tariffs  the financial burden falls upon the consumer  they reward the number of kilowatt hours produced over a long period of time  but because the rate is set by the authorities  it may result in perceived overpayment  the price paid per kilowatt hour under a feed in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity  net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged     alternatively  srecs allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsity  in this mechanism  a renewable energy production or consumption target is set  and the utility  more technically the load serving entity  is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine  alternative compliance payment or acp   the producer is credited for an srec for every      xa kwh of electricity produced  if the utility buys this srec and retires it  they avoid paying the acp  in principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy  since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations  uncertainties about the future value of srecs have led to long term srec contract markets to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre sell and hedge their credits     financial incentives for photovoltaics differ across countries  including australia  china    germany    israel    japan  and the united states and even across states within the us     the japanese government through its ministry of international trade and industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from      to       by the end of       japan led the world in installed pv capacity with over    xa gw       in       the german government introduced the first large scale feed in tariff system  under the german renewable energy act  which resulted in explosive growth of pv installations in germany  at the outset the fit was over  x the retail price or  x the industrial price  the principle behind the german system is a    year flat rate contract  the value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year  in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users  the programme has been more successful than expected with over  gw installed in       and political pressure is mounting to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers     subsequently  spain  italy  greece that enjoyed an early success with domestic solar thermal installations for hot water needs and france introduced feed in tariffs  none have replicated the programmed decrease of fit in new contracts though  making the german incentive relatively less and less attractive compared to other countries  the french and greek fit offer a high premium  eur      kwh  for building integrated systems  california  greece  france and italy have        more insolation than germany making them financially more attractive  the greek domestic  solar roof  programme  adopted in june      for installations up to   xa kw  has internal rates of return of        at current commercial installation costs  which  furthermore  is tax free     in      california approved the  california solar initiative   offering a choice of investment subsidies or fit for small and medium systems and a fit for large systems  the small system fit of       per kwh  far less than eu countries  expires in just   years  and the alternate  epbb  residential investment incentive is modest  averaging perhaps     of cost  all california incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of pv capacity installed     at the end of       the ontario power authority  opa  canada  began its standard offer program  a precursor to the green energy act  and the first in north america for distributed renewable projects of less than   xa mw  the feed in tariff guaranteed a fixed price of       cdn per kwh over a period of twenty years  unlike net metering  all the electricity produced was sold to the opa at the given rate     the price per kilowatt hour or per installed kilowatt of the fit or investment subsidies is only one of three factors that stimulate pv deployment  the other two factors are insolation  the more sunshine  the less capital is needed for a given power output  and administrative ease of obtaining permits and contracts     the complexity of approvals in california  spain and italy has prevented comparable growth to germany even though the return on investment is better     in some countries  additional incentives are offered for bipv compared to stand alone pv     unlike fossil fuel based technologies  solar power does not lead to any harmful emissions during operation  but the production of the panels leads to some amount of pollution     the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of solar power are in the range of    to    xa g kwh depending on if solar thermal or solar pv is being analyzed  respectively  with this potentially being decreased to   xa g kwh in the future    for comparison  of weighted averages   a combined cycle gas fired power plant emits some        xa g kwh    an oil fired power plant    xa g kwh    a coal fired power plant        xa g kwh   or with carbon capture and storage some    xa g kwh  and a geothermal high temp  power plant       xa g kwh    the life cycle emission intensity of hydro  wind and nuclear power are lower than solar s as of      as published by the ipcc  and discussed in the article life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of energy sources  similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase  the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions  bp solar owns two factories built by solarex  one in maryland  the other in virginia  in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels  a   kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately     pounds of coal      pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere  and saves up to     gallons of water consumption monthly       the energy payback time of a power generating system is the time required to generate as much energy as was consumed during production of the system  in      the energy payback time of pv systems was estimated as   to    years   and in      this was estimated to be     to     years for crystalline silicon pv systems   and       years for thin film technologies  s  europe        another economic measure  closely related to the energy payback time  is the energy returned on energy invested  eroei  or energy return on investment  eroi     which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment   this is not the same as the economic return on investment  roi   which varies according to local energy prices  subsidies available and metering techniques   with lifetimes of at least    yearscitation needed  the eroei of pv systems are in the range of    to     thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times       reproductions  depending on what type of material  balance of system  bos   and the geographic location of the system       one issue that has often raised concerns is the use of cadmium in cadmium telluride solar cells  cdte is only used in a few types of pv panels   cadmium in its metallic form is a toxic substance that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains  the amount of cadmium used in thin film pv modules is relatively small       g m   and with proper emission control techniques in place the cadmium emissions from module production can be almost zero  current pv technologies lead to cadmium emissions of         microgram kwh over the whole life cycle    most of these emissions actually arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules  and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher emissions of cadmium  life cycle cadmium emissions from coal is     microgram kwh  lignite      and natural gas     microgram kwh     note that if electricity produced by photovoltaic panels were used to manufacture the modules instead of electricity from burning coal  cadmium emissions from coal power usage in the manufacturing process could be entirely eliminated       some media sources have reported that solar power plants have injured or killed large numbers of birds due to intense heat    this adverse effect only applies to concentrated solar power plants however  and some of the claims may have been overstated or exaggerated       solar energy is not available at night  making energy storage an important issue in order to provide the continuous availability of energy    both wind power and solar power are intermittent energy sources  meaning that all available output must be taken when it is available and either stored for when it can be used  or transported  over transmission lines  to where it can be used     off grid pv systems have traditionally used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity  with grid tied systems  excess electricity can be sent to the transmission grid  net metering and feed in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce  this credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand  effectively using the grid as a storage mechanism  credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually    when wind and solar are a small fraction of the grid power  other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately  but as these forms of variable power grow  this becomes less practical     solar energy can be stored at high temperatures using molten salts  salts are an effective storage medium because they are low cost  have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems  the solar two used this method of energy storage  allowing it to store     xa tj in its   xa m  storage tank  enough to provide full output for close to    hours  with an efficiency of about           conventional hydroelectricity works very well in conjunction with intermittent electricity sources such as solar and wind  the water can be held back and allowed to flow as required with virtually no energy loss  where a suitable river is not available  pumped storage hydroelectricity stores energy in the form of water pumped when surplus electricity is available  from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one  the energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water  the pump becomes a turbine  and the motor a hydroelectric power generator    however  this loses some of the energy to pumpage losses     artificial photosynthesis involves the use of nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds  by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol  many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture  quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions    senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis to address critical energy security and environmental sustainability issues       wind power and solar power tend to be somewhat complementary  as there tends to be more wind in the winter and more sun in the summer  but on days with no sun and no wind the difference needs to be made up in some manner    solar power is seasonal  particularly in northern southern climates  away from the equator  suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen  the storage requirements vary and in some cases can be met with biomass    the institute for solar energy supply technology of the university of kassel pilot tested a combined power plant linking solar  wind  biogas and hydrostorage to provide load following power around the clock  entirely from renewable sources       concentrated photovoltaics  cpv  systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electrical power production  solar concentrators of all varieties may be used  and these are often mounted on a solar tracker in order to keep the focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky    luminescent solar concentrators  when combined with a pv solar cell  can also be regarded as a cpv system  concentrated photovoltaics are useful as they can improve efficiency of pv solar panels drastically       thermoelectric  or  thermovoltaic  devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current  first proposed as a method to store solar energy by solar pioneer mouchout in the     s    thermoelectrics reemerged in the soviet union during the     s  under the direction of soviet scientist abram ioffe a concentrating system was used to thermoelectrically generate power for a  xa hp engine    thermogenerators  but in the following cases powered by the heat source plutonium     in radioisotope thermoelectric generators are used in the us space program as an energy conversion technology for powering deep space missions such as the mars curiosity rover  cassini  galileo and viking  research in this area of thermogenerators  which can use any heat source  is focused on raising the efficiency of these devices from      to              physicists have claimed that recent technological developments bring the cost of solar energy more in parity with that of fossil fuels  in       david faiman  the director of the ben gurion national solar energy center of israel  announced that the center had entered into a project with zenith solar to create a home solar energy system that uses a    square meter reflector dish    in testing  the concentrated solar technology proved to be up to five times more cost effective than standard flat photovoltaic silicon panels  which would make it almost the same cost as oil and natural gas    a prototype ready for commercialization achieved a concentration of solar energy that was more than       times greater than standard flat panels       most spacecraft operating in the inner solar system are usually solar powered and rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight  space based solar power uses high efficient multijunction photovoltaic cells
