 cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computing  it brings a systematic approach to concerns of commercialization  standardization  and governance of cloud computing applications  in practice  it leverages the methods and tools of engineering in conceiving  developing  operating and maintaining cloud computing systems and solutions   it is about the process of designing the systems necessary to leverage the power and economics of cloud resources to solve business problems              cloud engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on cloud services  such as  software as a service    platform as a service   and  infrastructure as a service   it is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems engineering  software engineering  web engineering  performance engineering  information engineering  security engineering  platform engineering  service engineering  risk engineering  and quality engineering  the nature of commodity like capabilities delivered by cloud services and the inherent challenges in this business model drive the need for cloud engineering as the core discipline     elements of cloud engineering include     the professionals who work in the field of cloud engineering are primarily cloud architects and engineers  the key skills possessed by cloud engineering professionals are     the demand for skills in advanced ict  information and communication technology  has rapidly expanded in recent years as business and society are being transformed by the emergence of internet and web as ubiquitous media for enabling knowledge based global economy  this in turn has created a huge demand for networked enabled parallel and distributed computing technologies that are changing the way we conduct science  operate business  and tackle challenging problems such as epidemic diseases and climate change     the notion of cloud engineering in the context of cloud computing had been sparsely used in discussions  presentations and talks in various occasions in the middle of the     s  the term of cloud engineering was formally coined around      and the concept of cloud engineering was officially introduced in april       various aspects and topics of this subject have been extensively covered in a number of industry events  extensive research has been conducted on specific areas in cloud engineering  such as development support for cloud patterns  and cloud business continuity services  the first ieee international conference on cloud engineering  ic e  took place on march              and the second conference was held on march
