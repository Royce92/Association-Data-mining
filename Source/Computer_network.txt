 a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows computers to exchange data  in computer networks  networked computing devices pass data to each other along data connections  network links   data is transferred in the form of packets  the connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media  the best known computer network is the internet     network computer devices that originate  route and terminate the data are called network nodes   nodes can include hosts such as personal computers  phones  servers as well as networking hardware  two such devices are said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device  whether or not they have a direct connection to each other     computer networks differ in the transmission media used to carry their signals  the communications protocols to organize network traffic  the network s size  topology and organizational intent  in most cases  communications protocols are layered on  i e  work using  other more specific or more general communications protocols  except for the physical layer that directly deals with the transmission media     computer networks support applications such as access to the world wide web  shared use of application and storage servers  printers  and fax machines  and use of email and instant messaging applications     a computer network  or simply a network  is a collection of computers and other hardware components interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information  as of     update computer networks are the core of modern communication  computers control all modern aspects of the public switched telephone network  pstn   telephony increasingly runs over the internet protocol  although not necessarily over the public internet  the scope of communication has increased significantly in the past decade  this boom in communications would not have been possible without the progressively advancing computer network  computer networks  and the technologies that make communication between networked computers possible  continue to drive computer the hardware  software  and peripherals industries  the expansion of related industries is mirrored by growth in the numbers and types of people using networks  from the researcher to the home user     the chronology of significant computer network developments includes     computer networking may be considered a branch of electrical engineering  telecommunications  computer science  information technology or computer engineering  since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines     a computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing people to communicate efficiently and easily via email  instant messaging  chat rooms  telephone  video telephone calls  and video conferencing  providing access to information on shared storage devices is an important feature of many networks  a network allows sharing of files  data  and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network  a network allows sharing of network and computing resources  users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network  such as printing a document on a shared network printer  distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks  a computer network may be used by computer crackers to deploy computer viruses or computer worms on devices connected to the network  or to prevent these devices from accessing the network  denial of service   a complex computer network may be difficult to set up  it may be costly to set up an effective computer network in a large organization     computer communication links that do not support packets  such as traditional point to point telecommunication links  simply transmit data as a bit stream  however  most information in computer networks is carried in packets  a network packet is a formatted unit of data  a list of bits or bytes  usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long  carried by a packet switched network     in packet networks  the data is formatted into packets that are sent through the network to their destination  once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original message  with packets  the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched  when one user is not sending packets  the link can be filled with packets from others users  and so the cost can be shared  with relatively little interference  provided the link isn t overused     packets consist of two kinds of data  control information and user data  also known as payload   the control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data  for example  source and destination network addresses  error detection codes  and sequencing information  typically  control information is found in packet headers and trailers  with payload data in between     often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available  in that case the packet is queued and waits until a link is free     the physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes  most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological  rather than geographic  the symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes     the transmission media  often referred to in the literature as the physical media  used to link devices to form a computer network include electrical cable  ethernet  homepna  power line communication  g hn   optical fiber  fiber optic communication   and radio waves  wireless networking   in the osi model  these are defined at layers   and     the physical layer and the data link layer     a widely adopted family of transmission media used in local area network  lan  technology is collectively known as ethernet  the media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over ethernet are defined by ieee        ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables  wireless lan standards  e g  those defined by ieee         use radio waves  or others use infrared signals as a transmission medium  power line communication uses a building s power cabling to transmit data     the orders of the following wired technologies are  roughly  from slowest to fastest transmission speed     price is a main factor distinguishing wired  and wireless technology options in a business  wireless options command a price premium that can make purchasing wired computers  printers and other devices a financial benefit  before making the decision to purchase hard wired technology products  a review of the restrictions and limitations of the selections is necessary  business and employee needs may override any cost considerations      there have been various attempts at transporting data over exotic media     both cases have a large round trip delay time  which gives slow two way communication  but doesn t prevent sending large amounts of information     apart from any physical transmission medium there may be  networks comprise additional basic system building blocks  such as network interface controller  nics   repeaters  hubs  bridges  switches  routers  modems  and firewalls     a network interface controller  nic  is computer hardware that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media  and has the ability to process low level network information  for example the nic may have a connector for accepting a cable  or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception  and the associated circuitry     the nic responds to traffic addressed to a network address for either the nic or the computer as a whole     in ethernet networks  each network interface controller has a unique media access control  mac  address usually stored in the controller s permanent memory  to avoid address conflicts between network devices  the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  ieee  maintains and administers mac address uniqueness  the size of an ethernet mac address is six octets  the three most significant octets are reserved to identify nic manufacturers  these manufacturers  using only their assigned prefixes  uniquely assign the three least significant octets of every ethernet interface they produce     a repeater is an electronic device that receives a network signal  cleans it of unnecessary noise  and regenerates it  the signal is retransmitted at a higher power level  or to the other side of an obstruction  so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation  in most twisted pair ethernet configurations  repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than     meters  with fiber optics  repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart     a repeater with multiple ports is known as a hub  repeaters work on the physical layer of the osi model  repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal  this can cause a propagation delay that affects network performance  as a result  many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row  e g   the ethernet       rule     hubs have been mostly obsoleted by modern switches  but repeaters are used for long distance links  notably undersea cabling     a network bridge connects and filters traffic between two network segments at the data link layer  layer    of the osi model to form a single network  this breaks the network s collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain  network segmentation breaks down a large  congested network into an aggregation of smaller  more efficient networks     bridges come in three basic types     a network switch is a device that forwards and filters osi layer   datagrams between ports based on the mac addresses in the packets   a switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected  it can be thought of as a multi port bridge    it learns to associate physical ports to mac addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames  if an unknown destination is targeted  the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source  switches normally have numerous ports  facilitating a star topology for devices  and cascading additional switches     multi layer switches are capable of routing based on layer   addressing or additional logical levels  the term switch is often used loosely to include devices such as routers and bridges  as well as devices that may distribute traffic based on load or based on application content  e g   a web url identifier      a router is an internetworking device that forwards packets between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram  internet protocol information from layer     the routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table  or forwarding table   a router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets   a destination in a routing table can include a  null  interface  also known as the  black hole  interface because data can go into it  however  no further processing is done for said data      modems  modulator demodulator  are used to connect network nodes via wire not originally designed for digital network traffic  or for wireless  to do this one or more frequencies are modulated by the digital signal to produce an analog signal that can be tailored to give the required properties for transmission  modems are commonly used for telephone lines  using a digital subscriber line technology     a firewall is a network device for controlling network security and access rules  firewalls are typically configured to reject access requests from unrecognized sources while allowing actions from recognized ones  the vital role firewalls play in network security grows in parallel with the constant increase in cyber attacks     network topology is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network  different network topologies can affect throughput  but reliability is often more critical  with many technologies  such as bus networks  a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely  in general the more interconnections there are  the more robust the network is  but the more expensive it is to install     common layouts are     note that the physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology  as an example  with fddi  the network topology is a ring  actually two counter rotating rings   but the physical topology is often a star  because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location     an overlay network is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network  nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links  each link corresponds to a path  perhaps through many physical links  in the underlying network  the topology of the overlay network may  and often does  differ from that of the underlying one  for example  many peer to peer networks are overlay networks  they are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the internet       overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using modems  before any data network existed     the most striking example of an overlay network is the internet itself  the internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the telephone network    even today  at the network layer  each node can reach any other by a direct connection to the desired ip address  thereby creating a fully connected network  the underlying network  however  is composed of a mesh like interconnect of sub networks of varying topologies  and technologies   address resolution and routing are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected ip overlay network to its underlying network     another example of an overlay network is a distributed hash table  which maps keys to nodes in the network  in this case  the underlying network is an ip network  and the overlay network is a table  actually a map  indexed by keys     overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve internet routing  such as through quality of service guarantees to achieve higher quality streaming media  previous proposals such as intserv  diffserv  and ip multicast have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all routers in the network citation needed on the other hand  an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end hosts running the overlay protocol software  without cooperation from internet service providers  the overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes  but it can control  for example  the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination     for example  akamai technologies manages an overlay network that provides reliable  efficient content delivery  a kind of multicast   academic research includes end system multicast    resilient routing and quality of service studies  among others     a communications protocol is a set of rules for exchanging information over network links  in a protocol stack  also see the osi model   each protocol leverages the services of the protocol below it  an important example of a protocol stack is http  the world wide web protocol  running over tcp over ip  the internet protocols  over ieee         the wi fi protocol   this stack is used between the wireless router and the home user s personal computer when the user is surfing the web     whilst the use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking  it has been historically criticized by many researchers   for two principal reasons  firstly  abstracting the protocol stack in this way may cause a higher layer to duplicate functionality of a lower layer  a prime example being error recovery on both a per link basis and an end to end basis    secondly  it is common that a protocol implementation at one layer may require data  state or addressing information that is only present at another layer  thus defeating the point of separating the layers in the first place  for example  tcp uses the ecn field in the ipv  header as an indication of congestion  ip is a network layer protocol whereas tcp is a transport layer protocol     communication protocols have various characteristics  they may be connection oriented or connectionless  they may use circuit mode or packet switching  and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing     there are many communication protocols  a few of which are described below     the complete ieee     protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities  the protocols have a flat addressing scheme  they operate mostly at levels   and   of the osi model     for example  mac bridging  ieee      d  deals with the routing of ethernet packets using a spanning tree protocol  ieee      q describes vlans  and ieee      x defines a port based network access control protocol  which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in vlans  but it is also found in wlans xa   it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a  wireless access key      ethernet  sometimes simply called lan  is a family of protocols used in wired lans  described by a set of standards together called ieee       published by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers     wireless lan  also widely known as wlan or wifi  is probably the most well known member of the ieee     protocol family for home users today  it is standarized by ieee        and shares many properties with wired ethernet     the internet protocol suite  also called tcp ip  is the foundation of all modern networking  it offers connection less as well as connection oriented services over an inherently unreliable network traversed by data gram transmission at the internet protocol  ip  level  at its core  the protocol suite defines the addressing  identification  and routing specifications for internet protocol version    ipv   and for ipv   the next generation of the protocol with a much enlarged addressing capability     synchronous optical networking  sonet  and synchronous digital hierarchy  sdh  are standardized multiplexing protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers  they were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources  primarily to support real time  uncompressed  circuit switched voice encoded in pcm  pulse code modulation  format  however  due to its protocol neutrality and transport oriented features  sonet sdh also was the obvious choice for transporting asynchronous transfer mode  atm  frames     asynchronous transfer mode  atm  is a switching technique for telecommunication networks  it uses asynchronous time division multiplexing and encodes data into small  fixed sized cells  this differs from other protocols such as the internet protocol suite or ethernet that use variable sized packets or frames  atm has similarity with both circuit and packet switched networking  this makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high throughput data traffic  and real time  low latency content such as voice and video  atm uses a connection oriented model in which a virtual circuit must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins     while the role of atm is diminishing in favor of next generation networks  it still plays a role in the last mile  which is the connection between an internet service provider and the home user       a network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose  use of the network  including user authorization and access rights  differ accordingly     a nanoscale communication network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms  nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication       a personal area network  pan  is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person  some examples of devices that are used in a pan are personal computers  printers  fax machines  telephones  pdas  scanners  and even video game consoles  a pan may include wired and wireless devices  the reach of a pan typically extends to    meters    a wired pan is usually constructed with usb and firewire connections while technologies such as bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless pan     a local area network  lan  is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home  school  office building  or closely positioned group of buildings  each computer or device on the network is a node  wired lans are most likely based on ethernet technology  newer standards such as itu t g hn also provide a way to create a wired lan using existing wiring  such as coaxial cables  telephone lines  and power lines       all interconnected devices use the network layer  layer    to handle multiple subnets  represented by different colors   those inside the library have        mbit s ethernet connections to the user device and a gigabit ethernet connection to the central router  they could be called layer   switches  because they only have ethernet interfaces and support the internet protocol  it might be more correct to call them access routers  where the router at the top is a distribution router that connects to the internet and to the academic networks  customer access routers     the defining characteristics of a lan  in contrast to a wide area network  wan   include higher data transfer rates  limited geographic range  and lack of reliance on leased lines to provide connectivity  current ethernet or other ieee       lan technologies operate at data transfer rates up to    gbit s  the ieee investigates the standardization of    and     gbit s rates    a lan can be connected to a wan using a router     a home area network  han  is a residential lan used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home  usually a small number of personal computers and accessories  such as printers and mobile computing devices  an important function is the sharing of internet access  often a broadband service through a cable tv or digital subscriber line  dsl  provider     a storage area network  san  is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated  block level data storage  sans are primarily used to make storage devices  such as disk arrays  tape libraries  and optical jukeboxes  accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system  a san typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices  the cost and complexity of sans dropped in the early     s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium sized business environments     a campus area network  can  is made up of an interconnection of lans within a limited geographical area  the networking equipment  switches  routers  and transmission media  optical fiber  copper plant  cat  cabling  etc   are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant   owner  an enterprise  university  government  etc       for example  a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments  the library  and student residence halls     a backbone network is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different lans or sub networks  a backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building  across different buildings  or over a wide area     for example  a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world  the equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone  when designing a network backbone  network performance and network congestion are critical factors to take into account  normally  the backbone network s capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it     another example of a backbone network is the internet backbone  which is the set of wide area networks  wans  and core routers that tie together all networks connected to the internet     a metropolitan area network  man  is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus     a wide area network  wan  is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city  country  or spans even intercontinental distances  a wan uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines  cables  and air waves  a wan often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers  such as telephone companies  wan technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the osi reference model  the physical layer  the data link layer  and the network layer     an enterprise private network is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations  e g   production sites  head offices  remote offices  shops  so they can share computer resources     a virtual private network  vpn  is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network  e g   the internet  instead of by physical wires  the data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case  one common application is secure communications through the public internet  but a vpn need not have explicit security features  such as authentication or content encryption  vpns  for example  can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features     vpn may have best effort performance  or may have a defined service level agreement  sla  between the vpn customer and the vpn service provider  generally  a vpn has a topology more complex than point to point     a global area network  gan  is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless lans  satellite coverage areas  etc  the key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next  in ieee project      this involves a succession of terrestrial wireless lans       networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them  private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets  they may also provide network access to the internet  which has no single owner and permits virtually unlimited global connectivity     an intranet is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity  the intranet uses the ip protocol and ip based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications  the administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users  most commonly  an intranet is the internal lan of an organization  a large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information  an intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network     an extranet is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization  but supports a limited connection to a specific external network  for example  an organization may provide access to some aspects of its intranet to share data with its business partners or customers  these other entities are not necessarily trusted from a security standpoint  network connection to an extranet is often  but not always  implemented via wan technology     an internetwork is the connection of multiple computer networks via a common routing technology using routers     the internet is the largest example of an internetwork  it is a global system of interconnected governmental  academic  corporate  public  and private computer networks  it is based on the networking technologies of the internet protocol suite  it is the successor of the advanced research projects agency network  arpanet  developed by darpa of the united states department of defense  the internet is also the communications backbone underlying the world wide web  www      participants in the internet use a diverse array of methods of several hundred documented  and often standardized  protocols compatible with the internet protocol suite and an addressing system  ip addresses  administered by the internet assigned numbers authority and address registries  service providers and large enterprises exchange information about the reachability of their address spaces through the border gateway protocol  bgp   forming a redundant worldwide mesh of transmission paths     a darknet is an overlay network  typically running on the internet  that is only accessible through specialized software  a darknet is an anonymizing network where connections are made only between trusted peersxa   sometimes called  friends   f f   xa   using non standard protocols and ports     darknets are distinct from other distributed peer to peer networks as sharing is anonymous  that is  ip addresses are not publicly shared   and therefore users can communicate with little fear of governmental or corporate interference       routing is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic  routing is performed for many kinds of networks  including circuit switching networks and packet switched networks     in packet switched networks  routing directs packet forwarding  the transit of logically addressed network packets from their source toward their ultimate destination  through intermediate nodes  intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as routers  bridges  gateways  firewalls  or switches  general purpose computers can also forward packets and perform routing  though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance  the routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of routing tables  which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations  thus  constructing routing tables  which are held in the router s memory  is very important for efficient routing  most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time  multipath routing techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths     there are usually multiple routes that can be taken  and to choose between them  different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table  such as  sorted by priority      routing  in a more narrow sense of the term  is often contrasted with bridging in its assumption that network addresses are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network  structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices  in large networks  structured addressing  routing  in the narrow sense  outperforms unstructured addressing  bridging   routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the internet  bridging is still widely used within localized environments     network services are applications hosted by servers on a computer network  to provide some functionality for members or users of the network  or to help the network itself to operate     the world wide web  e mail    printing and network file sharing are examples of well known network services  network services such as dns  domain name system  give names for ip and mac addresses  people remember names like  nm lan  better than numbers like                     and dhcp to ensure that the equipment on the network has a valid ip address       services are usually based on a service protocol that defines the format and sequencing of messages between clients and servers of that network service     depending on the installation requirements  network performance is usually measured by the quality of service of a telecommunications product  the parameters that affect this typically can include throughput  jitter  bit error rate and latency     the following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit switched network and one type of packet switched network  viz  atm     there are many ways to measure the performance of a network  as each network is different in nature and design  performance can also be modelled instead of measured  for example  state transition diagrams are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit switched network  the network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state  ensuring that the network is optimally designed       network congestion occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its quality of service deteriorates  typical effects include queueing delay  packet loss or the blocking of new connections  a consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in offered load lead either only to small increase in network throughput  or to an actual reduction in network throughput     network protocols that use aggressive retransmissions to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion  thus  networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load  the stable state with low throughput is known as congestive collapse     modern networks use congestion control and congestion avoidance techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse  these include  exponential backoff in protocols such as        s csma ca and the original ethernet  window reduction in tcp  and fair queueing in devices such as routers  another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes  so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others  priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves  but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services  an example of this is      p  a third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows  one example of this is the use of contention free transmission opportunities  cftxops  in the itu t g hn standard  which provides high speed  up to   gbit s  local area networking over existing home wires  power lines  phone lines and coaxial cables      for the internet rfc      addresses the subject of congestion control in detail     network resilience is  the ability to provide and maintain an acceptable level of service in the face of faults and challenges to normal operation        network security consists of provisions and policies adopted by the network administrator to prevent and monitor unauthorized access  misuse  modification  or denial of the computer network and its network accessible resources    network security is the authorization of access to data in a network  which is controlled by the network administrator  users are assigned an id and password that allows them access to information and programs within their authority  network security is used on a variety of computer networks  both public and private  to secure daily transactions and communications among businesses  government agencies and individuals     network surveillance is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the internet  the monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments  by corporations  criminal organizations  or individuals  it may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency     computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today  and almost all internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity     surveillance is very useful to governments and law enforcement to maintain social control  recognize and monitor threats  and prevent investigate criminal activity  with the advent of programs such as the total information awareness program  technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software  and laws such as the communications assistance for law enforcement act  governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens       however  many civil rights and privacy groups such as reporters without borders  the electronic frontier foundation  and the american civil liberties union have expressed concern that increasing surveillance of citizens may lead to a mass surveillance society  with limited political and personal freedoms  fears such as this have led to numerous lawsuits such as hepting v  at t      the hacktivist group anonymous has hacked into government websites in protest of what it considers  draconian surveillance          end to end encryption  e ee  is a digital communications paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties  it involves the originating party encrypting data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it  with no dependency on third parties  end to end encryption prevents intermediaries  such as internet providers or application service providers  from discovering or tampering with communications  end to end encryption generally protects both confidentiality and integrity     examples of end to end encryption include pgp for email  otr for instant messaging  zrtp for telephony  and tetra for radio     typical server based communications systems do not include end to end encryption  these systems can only guarantee protection of communications between clients and servers  not between the communicating parties themselves  examples of non e ee systems are google talk  yahoo messenger  facebook  and dropbox  some such systems  for example lavabit and secretink  have even described themselves as offering  end to end  encryption when they do not  some systems that normally offer end to end encryption have turned out to contain a back door that subverts negotiation of the encryption key between the communicating parties  for example skype     the end to end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves  such as the technical exploitation of clients  poor quality random number generators  or key escrow  e ee also does not address traffic analysis  which relates to things such as the identities of the end points and the times and quantities of messages that are sent     users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks  users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup  which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same lan  whereas a network administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running  a community of interest has less of a connection of being in a local area  and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers  and possibly also communicate via peer to peer technologies     network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives  the physical perspective involves geographic locations  physical cabling  and the network elements  e g   routers  bridges and application layer gateways  that interconnect via the transmission media  logical networks  called  in the tcp ip architecture  subnets  map onto one or more transmission media  for
