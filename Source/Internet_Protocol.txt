 the internet protocol  ip  is the principal communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries  its routing function enables internetworking  and essentially establishes the internet     ip  as the primary protocol in the internet layer of the internet protocol suite  has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the ip addresses in the packet headers  for this purpose  ip defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered  it also defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information     historically  ip was the connectionless datagram service in the original transmission control program introduced by vint cerf and bob kahn in       the other being the connection oriented transmission control protocol  tcp   the internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as tcp ip     the first major version of ip  internet protocol version    ipv    is the dominant protocol of the internet  its successor is internet protocol version    ipv               the internet protocol is responsible for addressing hosts and for routing datagrams  packets  from a source host to a destination host across one or more ip networks  for this purpose  the internet protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system that has two functions  identifying hosts  and providing a logical location service citation needed    each datagram has two components  a header and a payload  the ip header is tagged with the source ip address  the destination ip address  and other meta data needed to route and deliver the datagram  the payload is the data that is transported  this method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called encapsulation     ip addressing entails the assignment of ip addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces  the address space is divided into networks and subnetworks  involving the designation of network or routing prefixes  ip routing is performed by all hosts  but most importantly by routers  which transport packets across network boundaries  routers communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols  either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols  as needed for the topology of the network     ip routing is also common in local networks  for example  many ethernet switches support ip multicast operations   these switches use ip addresses and internet group management protocol to control multicast routing but use mac addresses for the actual routing citation needed    the design of the internet protocols is based on the end to end principle  the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and assumes that it is dynamic in terms of availability of links and nodes  no central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network  for the benefit of reducing network complexity  the intelligence in the network is purposely mostly located in the end nodes of data transmission  routers in the transmission path forward packets to the next known  directly reachable gateway matching the routing prefix for the destination address     as a consequence of this design  the internet protocol only provides best effort delivery and its service is characterized as unreliable  in network architectural language  it is a connectionless protocol  in contrast to connection oriented modes of transmission  various error conditions may occur  such as data corruption  packet loss  duplication and out of order delivery  because routing is dynamic  meaning every packet is treated independently  and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets  different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths  resulting in out of order sequencing at the receiver     internet protocol version    ipv   provides safeguards to ensure that the ip packet header is error free  a routing node calculates a checksum for a packet  if the checksum is bad  the routing node discards the packet  the routing node does not have to notify either end node  although the internet control message protocol  icmp  allows such notification  by contrast  in order to increase performance  and since current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection   the ipv  header has no checksum to protect it      all error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the end nodes of a transmission  the upper layer protocols of the internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues  for example  a host may cache network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application     the dynamic nature of the internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of  or suitable for  performing the data transmission requested  even if the path is available and reliable  one of the technical constraints is the size of data packets allowed on a given link  an application must assure that it uses proper transmission characteristics  some of this responsibility lies also in the upper layer protocols  facilities exist to examine the maximum transmission unit  mtu  size of the local link and path mtu discovery can be used for the entire projected path to the destination  the ipv  internetworking layer has the capability to automatically fragment the original datagram into smaller units for transmission  in this case  ip provides re ordering of fragments delivered out of order      the transmission control protocol  tcp  is an example of a protocol that adjusts its segment size to be smaller than the mtu  the user datagram protocol  udp  and the internet control message protocol  icmp  disregard mtu size  thereby forcing ip to fragment oversized datagrams      in may       the institute of electrical and electronic engineers  ieee  published a paper entitled  a protocol for packet network intercommunication    the paper s authors  vint cerf and bob kahn  described an internetworking protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes  a central control component of this model was the  transmission control program  that incorporated both connection oriented links and datagram services between hosts  the monolithic transmission control program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the transmission control protocol at the transport layer and the internet protocol at the network layer  the model became known as the department of defense  dod  internet model and internet protocol suite  and informally as tcp ip     the internet protocol is one of the elements that define the internet  the dominant internetworking protocol in the internet layer in use today is ipv   the number   is the protocol version number carried in every ip datagram  ipv  is described in rfc                the successor to ipv  is ipv   its most prominent modification from version   is the addressing system  ipv  uses    bit addresses  c    billion  or          addresses  while ipv  uses     bit addresses  c      undecillion  or          addresses   although adoption of ipv  has been slow  as of june     update  all united states government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for ipv   if only at the backbone level    ipv  was a result of several years of experimentation and dialog during which various protocol models were proposed  such as tp ix  rfc        pip  rfc       and tuba  tcp and udp with bigger addresses  rfc           ip versions   to   were experimental versions  used between      and       the following internet experiment note  ien  documents describe versions of the internet protocol prior to the modern version of ipv      version   was used by the internet stream protocol  an experimental streaming protocol     other protocol proposals named ipv  and ipv  briefly surfaced  but had no affiliation with any international standards body  and have had no support      on april          the ietf published an april fool s day joke about ipv       during the design phase of the arpanet and the early internet  the security aspects and needs of a public  international network could not be adequately anticipated  consequently  many internet protocols exhibited vulnerabilities highlighted by network attacks and later security assessments  in       a thorough security assessment and proposed mitigation of problems was published    the internet engineering task force  ietf  has been pursuing further studies
