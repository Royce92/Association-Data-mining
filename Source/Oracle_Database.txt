 oracle database  commonly referred to as oracle rdbms or simply as oracle  is an object relational database management system   produced and marketed by oracle corporation     larry ellison and two friends and former co workers  bob miner and ed oates  started a consultancy called software development laboratories  sdl  in       sdl developed the original version of the oracle software  the name oracle comes from the code name of a cia funded project ellison had worked on while previously employed by ampex              an oracle database system identified by an alphanumeric system identifier or sid  comprises at least one instance of the application  along with data storage  an instance identified persistently by an instantiation number  or activation id  sys v_ database activation   comprises a set of operating system processes and memory structures that interact with the storage   typical processes include pmon  the process monitor  and smon  the system monitor    oracle documentation can refer to an active database instance as a  shared memory realm       users of oracle databases refer to the server side memory structure as the sga  system global area   the sga typically holds cache information such as data buffers  sql commands  and user information  in addition to storage  the database consists of online redo logs  or logs   which hold transactional history  processes can in turn archive the online redo logs into archive logs  offline redo logs   which provide the basis  if necessary  for data recovery and for the physical standby forms of data replication using oracle data guard     if the oracle database administrator has implemented oracle rac  real application clusters   then multiple instances  usually on different servers  attach to a central storage array  this scenario offers advantages such as better performance  scalability and redundancy  however  support becomes more complex  and many sites do not use rac  in version   g  grid computing introduced shared resources where an instance can use  for example  cpu resources from another node  computer  in the grid     the oracle dbms can store and execute stored procedures and functions within itself  pl sql  oracle corporation s proprietary procedural extension to sql   or the object oriented language java can invoke such code objects and or provide the programming structures for writing them     the oracle rdbms stores data logically in the form of tablespaces and physically in the form of data files   datafiles     tablespaces can contain various types of memory segments  such as data segments  index segments  etc  segments in turn comprise one or more extents  extents comprise groups of contiguous data blocks  data blocks form the basic units of data storage     a dba can impose maximum quotas on storage per user within each tablespace      the partitioning feature was introduced in oracle     this allows the partitioning of tables based on different set of keys  specific partitions can then be easily added or dropped to help manage large data sets        oracle database management tracks its computer data storage with the help of information stored in the system tablespace  the system tablespace contains the data dictionary and often  by default  indexes and clusters  a data dictionary consists of a special collection of tables that contains information about all user objects in the database  since version  i  the oracle rdbms also supports  locally managed  tablespaces that store space management information in bitmaps in their own headers rather than in the system tablespace  as happens with the default  dictionary managed  tablespaces   version   g and later introduced the sysaux tablespace  which contains some of the tables formerly stored in the system tablespace  along with objects for other tools such as oem  which previously required its own tablespace       disk files primarily represent one of the following structures     at the physical level  data files comprise one or more data blocks  where the block size can vary between data files     data files can occupy pre allocated space in the file system of a computer server  utilize raw disk directly  or exist within asm logical volumes       most oracle database installations traditionally came with a default schema called scott  after the installation process sets up sample tables  the user can log into the database with the username scott and the password tiger  the name of the scott schema originated with bruce scott  one of the first employees at oracle  then software development laboratories   who had a cat named tiger       oracle corporation now de emphasizes the scott schema  as it uses few features of more recent oracle releases  most recentupdate examples supplied by oracle corporation reference the default hr or oe schemas     other default schemas     include     each oracle instance uses a system global area or sga a shared memory area to store its data and control information       each oracle instance allocates itself an sga when it starts and de allocates it at shut down time  the information in the sga consists of the following elements  each of which has a fixed size  established at instance startup     every oracle database has one or more physical datafiles  which contain all the database data  the data of logical database structures  such as tables and indexes  is physically stored in the datafiles allocated for a database     datafiles have the following characteristics     data in a datafile is read  as needed  during normal database operation and stored in the memory cache of oracle database  for example  if a user wants to access some data in a table of a database  and if the requested information is not already in the memory cache for the database  then it is read from the appropriate datafiles and stored in memory     modified or new data is not necessarily written to a datafile immediately  to reduce the amount of disk access and to increase performance  data is pooled in memory and written to the appropriate datafiles all at once    when you start the instance by using enterprise manager or sql plus  the amount of memory allocated for the sga is displayed       the library cache   stores shared sql  caching the parse tree and the execution plan for every unique sql statement  if multiple applications issue the same sql statement  each application can access the shared sql area  this reduces the amount of memory needed and reduces the processing time used for parsing and execution planning     the data dictionary comprises a set of tables and views that map the structure of the database     oracle databases store information here about the logical and physical structure of the database  the data dictionary contains information such as     the oracle instance frequently accesses the data dictionary to parse sql statements  oracle operation depends on ready access to the data dictionary performance bottlenecks in the data dictionary affect all oracle users  because of this  database administrators must make sure that the data dictionary cache   has sufficient capacity to cache this data  without enough memory for the data dictionary cache  users see a severe performance degradation  allocating sufficient memory to the shared pool where the data dictionary cache resides precludes these particular performance problem     the program global area     or pga memory area of an oracle instance contains data and control information for oracle s server processes     the size and content of the pga depends on the oracle server options installed  this area consists of the following components     dbas can monitor pga usage via the system view     the dynamic performance views  also known as  fixed views   within an oracle database present information from virtual tables  x  tables    built on the basis of database memory    database users can access the v  views  named after the prefix of their synonyms  to obtain information on database structures and performance     the oracle rdbms typically relies on a group of processes running simultaneously in the background and interacting to monitor and expedite database operations  typical operating environments might include   temporarily or permanently   some of the following individual processes  shown along with their abbreviated nomenclature        oracle database terminology distinguishes different computer science terms in describing how end users interact with the database     oracle databases control simultaneous access to data resources with locks  alternatively documented as  enqueues      the databases also utilize  latches    low level serialization mechanisms to protect shared data structures in the system global area       database administrators control many of the tunable variations in an oracle instance by means of values in a parameter file    this file in its ascii default form   pfile   normally has a name of the format init sid name  ora  the default binary equivalent server parameter file   spfile    dynamically reconfigurable to some extent    defaults to the format spfile sid name  ora  within an sql based environment  the views v parameter   and v spparameter   give access to reading parameter values     the  scheduler   dbms_scheduler package  available from oracle   g onwards  and the job subsystem  dbms_job package  permit the automation of predictable processing       oracle resource manager aims to allocate cpu resources between users and groups of users when such resources become scarce       oracle corporation stated in product announcements that manageability for dbas had improved from oracle i to   g  lungu and v tuiu        assessed the relative manageability by performing common dba tasks and measuring timings     they performed their tests on a single pentium cpu     xa ghz  with     mb ram running windows server       from oracle i to   g  installation improved      day to day administration      backup and recovery      and performance diagnostics and tuning      for a weighted total improvement of      the researchers concluded that  oracle  g represents a giant step forward from oracle i in making the database easier to use and manage      oracle net services allow client or remote applications to access oracle databases via network sessions using various protocols     oracle database software comes in    language versions  including regional variations such as british english and american english   variations between versions cover the names of days and months  abbreviations  time symbols  such as a m  and a d    and sorting       oracle corporation has translated oracle database error messages into arabic  catalan  chinese  czech  danish  dutch  english  finnish  french  german  greek  hebrew  hungarian  italian  japanese  korean  norwegian  polish  portuguese  romanian  russian  slovak  spanish  swedish  thai and turkish       oracle corporation provides database developers with tools and mechanisms for producing internationalized database applications  referred to internally as  globalization          oracle corporation releases critical patch updates  cpus  or security patch updates  spus    and security alerts to close security holes that could be used for data theft  critical patch updates  cpus  and security alerts come out quarterly on the tuesday closest to   th day of the month     oracle products follow a custom release numbering and naming convention  with the oracle rdbms   g release  oracle corporation began using the    g  label in all versions of its major products  although some sources refer to oracle applications release   i as oracle   i clarification needed the suffixes  i    g  and  c  do not actually represent a low order part of the version number  as letters typically represent in software industry version numbering  that is  there is no predecessor version of oracle   g called oracle   f  instead  the letters stand for  internet    grid  and  cloud   respectively    consequently many simply drop the  g  or  i  suffix when referring to specific versions of an oracle product     major database related products and some of their versions include     since version    oracle s rdbms release numbering has used the following codes     the version numbering syntax within each release follows the pattern  major maintenance application server component specific platform specific     for example            for    bit solaris  means    th major version of oracle  maintenance level    oracle application server  oracleas     level   for solaris    bit     the oracle database administrator s guide offers further information on oracle release numbers     over and above the different versions of the oracle database management software developed over time  oracle corporation subdivides its product into varying  editions    apparently for marketing and license tracking reasons   do not confuse the marketing  editions  with the internal virtual versioning  editions  introduced with oracle          in approximate order of decreasing functionality     prior to releasing oracle  i in       oracle corporation ported its database product to a wide variety of platforms  subsequently oracle corporation consolidated on a smaller range of operating system platforms     as of november     update  oracle corporation supported the following operating systems and hardware platforms for oracle database   g                    in       oracle corporation announced the availability of oracle database appliance  a pre built  pre tuned  highly available clustered database server built using two sunfire x   servers and direct attached storage     some oracle enterprise edition databases running on certain oracle supplied hardware can utilize hybrid columnar compression for more efficient storage       oracle corporation refers to some extensions to the core functionality of the oracle database as  database options     as of     update such options include         in most cases  using these options entails extra licensing costs         in addition to its rdbms  oracle corporation has released several related suites of tools and applications relating to implementations of oracle databases  for example     apart from the clearly defined database options  oracle databases may include many semi autonomous software sub systems  which oracle corporation sometimes refers to as  features  in a sense subtly different from the normal usage of the word  for example  oracle data guard counts officially as a  feature   but the command stack within sql plus  though a usability feature  does not appear in the list of  features  in oracle s list original research  such  features  may include  for example          users can develop their own applications in java and pl sql using tools such as     as of     update oracle corporation had started a drive toward  wizard  driven environments with a view to enabling non programmers to produce simple data driven applications        the database upgrade assistant  dbua     provides a gui for the upgrading of an oracle database        jaccelerator  ncomp    a native compilation java  accelerator   integrates hardware optimized java code into an oracle   g database        oracle sql developer  a free graphical tool for database development  allows developers to browse database objects  run sql statements and sql scripts  and edit and debug pl sql statements  it incorporates standard and customized reporting     oracle s opatch provides patch management for oracle databases        the sqltxplain tool  or sqlt  provides tuning assistance for oracle sql queries        by acquiring other technology in the database field  oracle corporation can also offer     the oracle rdbms has had a reputation among novice users as difficult to install on linux systems citation needed oracle corporation has packaged recentupdate versions for several popular linux distributions in an attempt to minimize installation challenges beyond the level of technical expertise required to install a database server citation needed    users who have oracle support contracts can use oracle s  my oracle support  or  mos     web site   known as  metalink  until a re branding exercise completed in october       the support site provides users of oracle corporation products with a repository of reported problems  diagnostic scripts and solutions  it also integrates with the provision of support tools  patches and upgrades     the remote diagnostic agent or rda    can operate as a command line diagnostic tool executing a script  the data captured provides an overview of the oracle database environment intended for diagnostic and trouble shooting  within rda  the hcve  health check validation engine     can verify and isolate host system environmental issues that may affect the performance of oracle software     oracle corporation also endorses certain practices and conventions as enhancing the use of its database products  these include     the oracle certification program  a professional certification program  includes the administration of oracle databases as one of its main certification paths  it contains three levels     a variety of official  oracle sponsored  and unofficial oracle user groups has grown up of users and developers of oracle databases  they include     as of      oracle holds    dbms market share worldwide based on the revenue share ahead of its four closest competitors   ibm   microsoft  sap and teradata        in the market for relational databases  oracle database competes against commercial products such as ibm s db  udb and microsoft sql server  oracle and ibm tend to battle for the mid range database market on unix and linux platforms  while microsoft dominates the mid range database market on microsoft windows platforms  however  since they share many of the same customers  oracle and ibm tend to support each other s products in many middleware and application categories  for example  websphere  peoplesoft  and siebel systems crm   and ibm s hardware divisions work closelycitation needed with oracle on performance optimizing server technologies  for example  linux on zseries   the two companies have a relationship perhapsoriginal research  best described as  coopetition   niche commercial competitors include teradata  in data warehousing and business intelligence   software ag s adabas  sybase  and ibm s informix  among many others     in       competition with sap ag occasioned litigation from oracle corporation        increasingly  the oracle database products compete against such open source software relational database systems as postgresql  firebird  and mysql  oracle acquired innobase  supplier of the innodb codebase to mysql  in part to compete better against open source alternatives  and acquired sun microsystems  owner of mysql  in       database products licensed as open source are  by the legal terms of the open source definition  free to distribute and free of royalty or other licensing fees     oracle corporation offers term licensing for all oracle products  it bases the list price for a term license on a specific percentage of the perpetual license price  prospective purchasers can obtain licenses based either on the number of processors in their target machines or on the number of potential seats   named users          as computers running oracle often have many multi core processors  resulting in many cores  all to be licensed   the software price can rise into the hundreds of thousands of dollars  the total cost of ownership often exceeds this  as large oracle installations usually require experienced and trained database administrators to do the set up properly  furthermore  further components must be licensed and paid for  for instance the enterprise options used with the databases  many licensing pitfalls let even rise the costs of ownership     because of the product s large installed base and available training courses  oracle specialists in some areas have become a more abundant resource than those for more exotic databases  oracle frequently provides special training offers for database administrators     on linux  oracle s certified configurations include oracle s own oracle linux and other commercial linux distributions  red hat enterprise linux      and    suse sles          and     asianux   which can cost in a range from a few hundred to a few thousand usd per year  depending on processor architecture and the support package purchased      the oracle database system can also install and run on freely available linux distributions such as the red hat based centos     or debian based systems
