federal authorities  the so called bundesstadt   federal city     the country is situated in western and central europe note   where it is bordered by italy to the south  france to the west  germany to the north  and austria and liechtenstein to the east  switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the alps  the swiss plateau and the jura  spanning an area of       xa km         xa sqxa mi   while the alps occupy the greater part of the territory  the swiss population of approximately   million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau  where the largest cities are to be found  among them are the two global and economic centres of z rich and geneva     the establishment of the swiss confederation is traditionally dated to   august       which is celebrated annually as swiss national day  the country has a long history of armed neutrality it has not been in a state of war internationally since      and did not join the united nations until       nevertheless it pursues an active foreign policy and is frequently involved in peace building processes around the world   in addition to being the birthplace of the red cross  switzerland is home to numerous international organizations  including the second largest un office  on the european level  it is a founding member of the european free trade association and is part of the schengen area   although it is notably not a member of the european union  nor the european economic area  and thus does not use the euro currency      straddling the intersection of germanic and romance europe  switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions  german  french  italian and romansh  therefore the swiss  although predominantly german speaking  do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnicity or language  rather  switzerland s strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background  shared values such as federalism and direct democracy    and alpine symbolism       switzerland ranks high in several metrics of national performance  including government transparency  civil liberties  economic competitiveness  and human development  it has the highest nominal wealth per adult  financial and non financial assets  in the world according to credit suisse and the eighth highest per capita gross domestic product on the imf list      swiss citizens have the second highest life expectancy in the world  z rich and geneva each have been ranked among the top cities with the highest quality of life in the world  the former coming second globally according to mercer                 the english name switzerland is a compound containing switzer  an obsolete term for the swiss  which was in use during the   th to   th centuries    the english adjective swiss is a loan from french suisse  also in use since the   th century  the name switzer is from the alemannic schwiizer  in origin an inhabitant of schwyz and its associated territory  one of the waldst tten cantons which formed the nucleus of the old swiss confederacy  the name originates as an exonym  applied pars pro toto to the troops of the confederacy  the swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the swabian war of       used alongside the term for  confederates   eidgenossen  literally  comrades by oath   used since the   th century     the toponym schwyz itself is first attested in      as old high german suittes  ultimately perhaps related to suedan  to burn   referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build    the name was extended to the area dominated by the canton  and after the swabian war of      gradually came to be used for the entire confederation      the swiss german name of the country  schwiiz  is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement  but distinguished by the use of the definite article  d schwiiz for the confederation    but simply schwyz for the canton and the town        the latin name confoederatio helvetica was neologized and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in       harking back to the napoleonic helvetic republic  appearing on coins from       inscribed on the federal palace in      and after      used in the official seal    it is derived from the name of the helvetii  a gaulish tribe living on the swiss plateau before the roman era  helvetia appears as a national personification of the swiss confederacy in the   th century  with a      play by johann caspar weissenbach       switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the swiss federal constitution in       the precursors of switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the   th century         forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries     the oldest traces of hominid existence in switzerland date back about         years    the oldest known farming settlements in switzerland  which were found at g chlingen  have been dated to around      bc       the earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the hallstatt and la t ne cultures  named after the archaeological site of la t ne on the north side of lake neuch tel  la t ne culture developed and flourished during the late iron age from around     bc    possibly under some influence from the greek and etruscan civilisations  one of the most important tribal groups in the swiss region was the helvetii  steadily harassed by the germans  in    bc the helvetii decided to abandon the swiss plateau and migrate to western gallia  but julius caesar s armies pursued and defeated them at the battle of bibracte  in today s western france  forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland    in    bc  tiberius  who was destined to be the second roman emperor and his brother  drusus  conquered the alps  integrating them into the roman empire  the area occupied by the helvetii the namesakes of the later confoederatio helvetica first became part of rome s gallia belgica province and then of its germania superior province  while the eastern portion of modern switzerland was integrated into the roman province of raetia  sometime around the start of the common era  the romans maintained a large legionary camp called vindonissa  now a ruin at the confluence of the aare and reuss rivers  near the town of windisch  an outskirt of brugg     the first and second century ad were an age of prosperity for the population living along the swiss plateau  several towns  like aventicum  iulia equestris and augusta raurica  reached a remarkable size  while hundreds of agricultural estates  villae rusticae  were founded in the countryside     in about     ad  the fall of the agri decumates territory north of the rhine transformed today s switzerland into a frontier land of the empire  repeated raids by the alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the roman towns and economy  forcing the population to find shelter near roman fortresses  like the castrum rauracense near augusta raurica  the empire built another line of defense at the north border  the so called donau iller rhine limes   but at the end of the fourth century the increased germanic pressure forced the romans to abandon the linear defence concept  and the swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of german tribes     in the early middle ages  from the end of the  th century  the western extent of modern day switzerland was part of the territory of the kings of the burgundians  the alemanni settled the swiss plateau in the  th century and the valleys of the alps in the  th century  forming alemannia  modern day switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of alemannia and burgundy    the entire region became part of the expanding frankish empire in the  th century  following clovis i s victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in     ad  and later frankish domination of the burgundians         throughout the rest of the  th   th and  th centuries the swiss regions continued under frankish hegemony  merovingian and carolingian dynasties   but after its extension under charlemagne  the frankish empire was divided by the treaty of verdun in        the territories of present day switzerland became divided into middle francia and east francia until they were reunified under the holy roman empire around     xa ad       by       the swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of savoy  z hringer  habsburg  and kyburg    some regions  uri  schwyz  unterwalden  later known as waldst tten  were accorded the imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes  with the extinction of its male line in      the kyburg dynasty fell in ad       then the habsburgs under king rudolph i  holy roman emperor in       laid claim to the kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern swiss plateau       the old swiss confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central alps  the confederacy facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes  the federal charter of      agreed between the rural communes of uri  schwyz  and unterwalden is considered the confederacy s founding document  even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier         by       the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of glarus and zug and the lucerne  z rich and bern city states to form the  old confederacy  of eight states that existed until the end of the   th century  the expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation    by       the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the rhine to the alps and the jura mountains  particularly after victories against the habsburgs  battle of sempach  battle of n fels   over charles the bold of burgundy during the     s  and the success of the swiss mercenaries  the swiss victory in the swabian war against the swabian league of emperor maximilian i in      amounted to de facto independence within the holy roman empire       the old swiss confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars  but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in      with the swiss defeat in the battle of marignano  this ended the so called  heroic  epoch of swiss history    the success of zwingli s reformation in some cantons led to inter cantonal religious conflicts in      and       wars of kappel   it was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that  in       under the peace of westphalia  european countries recognized switzerland s independence from the holy roman empire and its neutrality         during the early modern period of swiss history  the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the thirty years  war led to the swiss peasant war of       in the background to this struggle  the conflict between catholic and protestant cantons persisted  erupting in further violence at the battles of villmergen in      and            in       the revolutionary french government conquered switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution    this centralised the government of the country  effectively abolishing the cantons  moreover  m lhausen joined france and valtellina valley  the cisalpine republic  separating from switzerland  the new regime  known as the helvetic republic  was highly unpopular  it had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition  making switzerland nothing more than a french satellite state  the fierce french suppression of the nidwalden revolt in september      was an example of the oppressive presence of the french army and the local population s resistance to the occupation     when war broke out between france and its rivals  russian and austrian forces invaded switzerland  the swiss refused to fight alongside the french in the name of the helvetic republic  in      napoleon organised a meeting of the leading swiss politicians from both sides in paris  the result was the act of mediation which largely restored swiss autonomy and introduced a confederation of    cantons    henceforth  much of swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons  tradition of self rule with the need for a central government     in      the congress of vienna fully re established swiss independence and the european powers agreed to permanently recognise swiss neutrality        swiss troops still served foreign governments until      when they fought in the siege of gaeta  the treaty also allowed switzerland to increase its territory  with the admission of the cantons of valais  neuch tel and geneva  switzerland s borders have not changed since  except some minor adjustments       the restoration of the power to the patriciate was only temporary  after a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the z riputsch of       civil war  the sonderbundskrieg  broke out in      when some catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance  the sonderbund     the war lasted for less than a month  causing fewer than     casualties  most of which were through friendly fire  however minor the sonderbundskrieg seems to be when compared with other european riots and wars in the   th century  it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the swiss and of switzerland     the war convinced most swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its european neighbours  swiss people from all strata of society  whether catholic or protestant  from the liberal or conservative current  realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged     thus  while the rest of europe saw revolutionary uprisings  the swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout  much of it inspired by the american example  this constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self government on local issues  giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons  the sonderbund kantone   the national assembly was divided between an upper house  the swiss council of states    representatives per canton  and a lower house  the national council of switzerland  representatives elected from across the country   referenda were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution       a system of single weights and measures was introduced and in      the swiss franc became the swiss single currency  article    of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad  though the swiss were still obliged to serve francis ii of the two sicilies with swiss guards present at the siege of gaeta in       marking the end of foreign service     an important clause of the constitution was that it could be re written completely if this was deemed necessary  thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time       this need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the industrial revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly  an early draft was rejected by the population in      but modifications led to its acceptance in         it introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level  it also established federal responsibility for defense  trade  and legal matters     in       the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy  which remain unique even today       switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars  during world war i  switzerland was home to vladimir illych ulyanov  vladimir lenin  and he remained there until         swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the grimm hoffmann affair in       but it was short lived  in       switzerland joined the league of nations  which was based in geneva  on the condition that it was exempt from any military requirements     during world war ii  detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the germans    but switzerland was never attacked    switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence  concessions to germany  and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion      under general henri guisan central command  a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered  the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland  to one of organised long term attrition and withdrawal to strong  well stockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit  switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the axis and allied powers       switzerland s trade was blockaded by both the allies and by the axis  economic cooperation and extension of credit to the third reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners  concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through vichy france was severed in       leaving switzerland completely surrounded by the axis  over the course of the war  switzerland interned over         refugees   and the international red cross  based in geneva  played an important part during the conflict  strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with nazi germany raised controversy  but not until the end of the   th century       during the war  the swiss air force engaged aircraft of both sides  shooting down    intruding luftwaffe planes in may and june       then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from germany  over     allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war  during          allied bombers mistakenly bombed a few places in switzerland  among which were the cities of schaffhausen  basel and z rich       after the war  the swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the schweizerspende and also donated to the marshall plan to help europe s recovery  efforts that ultimately benefited the swiss economy       during the cold war  swiss authorities considered the construction of a swiss nuclear bomb    leading nuclear physicists at the federal institute of technology zurich such as paul scherrer made this a realistic possibility  however  financial problems with the defense budget prevented the substantial funds from being allocated  and the nuclear non proliferation treaty of      was seen as a valid alternative  all remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by            switzerland was the last western republic to grant women the right to vote with some swiss cantons approving this in       and later with a federal level in          and  after resistance  in the last canton appenzell innerrhoden  one of only two remaining landsgemeinde  in       after suffrage at the federal level  women quickly rose in political significance  with the first woman on the seven member federal council executive being elisabeth kopp  who served from              and the first female president being ruth dreifuss in          switzerland joined the council of europe in         in      areas from the canton of bern attained independence from the bernese  forming the new canton of jura  on    april      the swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution       in      switzerland became a full member of the united nations  leaving the vatican city as the last widely recognised state without full un membership  switzerland is a founding member of the efta  but is not a member of the european economic area  an application for membership in the european union was sent in may       but not advanced since the eea was rejected in december        when switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the eea  there have since been several referenda on the eu issue  due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen  nonetheless  swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the eu  and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the european union  switzerland  together with liechtenstein  has been completely surrounded by the eu since austria s membership in       on   june       swiss voters agreed by a     majority to join the schengen treaty  a result that was regarded by eu commentators as a sign of support by switzerland  a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies       extending across the north and south side of the alps in west central europe  switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of        square kilometres        xa sqxa mi     the population is about  xa million  resulting in an average population density of around     people per square kilometre      sqxa mi       the more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half    in the largest canton of graub nden  lying entirely in the alps  population density falls to     km       sq mi        switzerland lies between latitudes     and     n  and longitudes    and     e  it contains three basic topographical areas  the swiss alps to the south  the swiss plateau or central plateau  and the jura mountains on the west  the alps are a high mountain range running across the central south of the country  comprising about     of the country s total area  the majority of the swiss population live in the swiss plateau  among the high valleys of the swiss alps many glaciers are found  totalling an area of       square kilometres     xa sqxa mi   from these originate the headwaters of several major rivers  such as the rhine  inn  ticino and rh ne  which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of europe  the hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in central and western europe  among which are included lake geneva also called le lac l man in french   lake constance  known as bodensee in german  and lake maggiore  switzerland has more than      lakes  and contains    of europe s stock of fresh water  lakes and glaciers cover about    of the national territory  the largest lake is lake geneva  in western switzerland shared with france  the rh ne is both the main source and outflow of lake geneva  lake constance is the second largest swiss lake and  like the lake geneva  an intermediate step by the rhine at the border to austria and germany  while the r ne flows into the mediterranean sea at the french camarque region and the rhine flows into the north sea at rotterdam in the netherlands  about     xa km apart  both springs are only about   xa km apart from each other in the swiss alps            of switzerland s mountains are       metres        xa ft  above sea in altitude or higher    at      xa m        xa ft   monte rosa is the highest  although the matterhorn       xa m or       xa ft  is often regarded as the most famous  both are located within the pennine alps in the canton of valais  the section of the bernese alps above the deep glacial lauterbrunnen valley  containing    waterfalls  is well known for the jungfrau       xa m or       xa ft  eiger and m nch  and the many picturesque valleys in the region  in the southeast the long engadin valley  encompassing the st  moritz area in canton of graub nden  is also well known  the highest peak in the neighbouring bernina alps is piz bernina       xa m or       xa ft        the more populous northern part of the country  comprising about     of the country s total area  is called the swiss plateau  it has greater open and hilly landscapes  partly forested  partly open pastures  usually with grazing herds  or vegetables and fruit fields  but it is still hilly  there are large lakes found here and the biggest swiss cities are in this area of the country       the swiss climate is generally temperate  but can vary greatly between the localities    from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerland s southern tip  there are some valley areas in the southern part of switzerland where some cold hardy palm trees are found  summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing  the less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks  while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion  during these periods  thus seeing no sun for weeks     a weather phenomenon known as the f hn  with an identical effect to the chinook wind  can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind  bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps  this works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south  valleys running south to north trigger the best effect  the driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas  large alpine areas such as graub nden remain drier than pre alpine areas and as in the main valley of the valais wine grapes are grown there       the wettest conditions persist in the high alps and in the ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time    precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer  autumn is the driest season  winter receives less precipitation than summer  yet the weather patterns in switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods     switzerland s ecosystems can be particularly fragile  because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies  the mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable  with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes  and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing  the climatic  geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change      nevertheless  according to the      environmental performance index  switzerland ranks first among     nations in safeguarding the environment  due to its high scores on environmental public health  its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy  hydropower and geothermal energy   and its control of greenhouse gas emissions       the federal constitution adopted in      is the legal foundation of the modern federal state  it is among the oldest constitutions in the world    a new constitution was adopted in       but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure  it outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs  divides the powers between the confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority  there are three main governing bodies on the federal level    the bicameral parliament  legislative   the federal council  executive  and the federal court  judicial      the swiss parliament consists of two houses  the council of states which has    representatives  two from each canton and one from each half canton  who are elected under a system determined by each canton  and the national council  which consists of     members who are elected under a system of proportional representation  depending on the population of each canton  members of both houses serve for   years  when both houses are in joint session  they are known collectively as the federal assembly  through referendums  citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through initiatives  introduce amendments to the federal constitution  thus making switzerland a direct democracy       the federal council constitutes the federal government  directs the federal administration and serves as collective head of state  it is a collegial body of seven members  elected for a four year mandate by the federal assembly which also exercises oversight over the council  the president of the confederation is elected by the assembly from among the seven members  traditionally in rotation and for a one year term  the president chairs the government and assumes representative functions  however  the president is a primus inter pares with no additional powers  and remains the head of a department within the administration       the swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since       each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament  the classic distribution of   cvp pdc    sps pss    fdp prd and   svp udc as it stood from      to      was known as the  magic formula   following the      federal council elections  the seven seats in the federal council were distributed as follows     the function of the federal supreme court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts  the judges are elected by the federal assembly for six year terms       swiss citizens are subject to three legal jurisdictions  the commune  canton and federal levels  the      federal constitution defines a system of direct democracy  sometimes called half direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a representative democracy   the instruments of this system at the federal level  known as civic rights  volksrechte  droits civiques   include the right to submit a constitutional initiative and a referendum  both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions         by calling a federal referendum  a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament  if they gather        signatures against the law within     days  if so  a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law  any   cantons together can also call a referendum on a federal law       similarly  the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote  if         voters sign the proposed amendment within    months note   parliament can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter proposal  and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted  constitutional amendments  whether introduced by initiative or in parliament  must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes note          the swiss confederation consists of    cantons and   half cantons        these cantons are known as half cantons and are thus represented by only one councillor  instead of two  in the council of states     the cantons have a permanent constitutional status and  in comparison with the situation in other countries  a high degree of independence  under the federal constitution  all    cantons are equal in status  each canton has its own constitution  and its own parliament  government and courts    however  there are considerable differences between the individual cantons  most particularly in terms of population and geographical area  their populations vary between         appenzell innerrhoden  and            z rich   and their area between   xa km     xa sqxa mi   basel stadt  and      xa km        xa sqxa mi   graub nden   the cantons comprise a total of       municipalities  within switzerland there are two enclaves  b singen belongs to germany  campione d italia belongs to italy       traditionally  switzerland avoids alliances that might entail military  political  or direct economic action and has been neutral since the end of its expansion in       its policy of neutrality was internationally recognised at the congress of vienna in           only in      did switzerland become a full member of the united nations   and it was the first state to join it by referendum  switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states    switzerland is not a member of the european union  the swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early     s       a large number of international institutions have their seats in switzerland  in part because of its policy of neutrality  geneva is the birthplace of the red cross and red crescent movement and the geneva conventions and  since       hosts the united nations human rights council  even though switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the united nations  the palace of nations in geneva is the second biggest centre for the united nations after new york  and switzerland was a founding member and home to the league of nations     apart from the united nations headquarters  the swiss confederation is host to many un agencies  like the world health organization  who   the international labour organization  ilo   the international telecommunication union  itu   the united nations high commissioner for refugees  unhcr  and about     other international organisations  including the world trade organization and the world intellectual property organization    the annual meetings of the world economic forum in davos bring together top international business and political leaders from switzerland and foreign countries to discuss important issues facing the world  including health and the environment     furthermore  many sport federations and organisations are located throughout the country  such as the international basketball federation in geneva  the union of european football associations  uefa  in nyon  the international federation of association football  fifa  and the international ice hockey federation both in z rich  the international cycling union in aigle  and the international olympic committee in lausanne       the swiss armed forces  including the land forces and the air force  are composed mostly of conscripts  male citizens aged from    to     in special cases up to     years  being a landlocked country  switzerland has no navy  however  on lakes bordering neighbouring countries  armed

strong majority        approval  in the canton of ticino  while metropolitan centers        rejection  and the french speaking part        rejection  of switzerland rather rejected it     some news

 and in the federal parliament simultaneous translation is provided from and into german  french and italian        aside from the official forms of their respective languages  the four linguistic regions of switzerland also have their local dialectal forms  the role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically  in the german speaking regions  swiss german dialects became ever more prevalent since the second half of the   th century  especially in the media  such as radio and television  and are used as an everyday language  while  the swiss variety of  standard german is used for almost all written situations  c f  diglossic usage of a language      conversely  in the french speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared  only      of the population of valais       of fribourg  and      of jura still spoke dialects at the end of the   th century   while in the italian speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation        the official languages  german  french and italian  have terms  not used outside of switzerland  known as helvetisms  german helvetisms are  roughly spoken  a large group of words typical of swiss standard german  which do not appear in either of standard german  nor standard german dialects  e g  terms from switzerland s surrounding language cultures  german billette    from french   from similar term in another language  italian azione used not only as act but also as discount from german aktion      the french spoken in switzerland has similar terms  which are equally known as helvetisms  the most frequent characteristics of helvetisms are in vocabulary  phrases  and pronunciation  but certain helvetisms denote themselves as special in syntax and orthography likewise  duden  one of the prescriptive sources for standard german  is aware of about      helvetisms     current french dictionaries  such as the petit larousse  include several hundred helvetisms        learning one of the other national languages at school is compulsory for all swiss students  so many swiss are supposed to be at least bilingual  especially those belonging to minorities        swiss citizens are universally required to buy health insurance from private insurance companies  which in turn are required to accept every applicant  while the cost of the system is among the highest  the system compares well with other european countries in terms of health outcomes  so patients are largely satisfied with it  in       life expectancy at birth was      years for men and      years for women     these are the world s highest life expectancy        however  spending on health is particularly high  with       of gdp         however in par with germany and france         and other european countries  but far less than in usa             from       a steady increase is observed  reflecting the high prices of the services provided     with aging populations and new healthcare technologies  health spending will likely continue to rise        between two thirds and three quarters of the population live in urban areas        switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just    years  since      urban development has claimed as much of the swiss landscape as it did during the previous       years  this urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the jura and the alpine foothills    and there are growing concerns about land use     however from the beginning of the   st century  the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside        switzerland has a dense network of cities  where large  medium and small cities are complementary     the plateau is very densely populated with about     people per km  and the landscape continually shows signs of man s presence     the weight of the largest metropolitan areas  which are z rich  geneva lausanne  basel and bern tend to increase     in international comparison the importance of these urban areas is stronger than their number of inhabitants suggests     in addition the two main centers of z rich and geneva are recognized for their particularly great quality of life        switzerland has no official state religion  though most of the cantons  except geneva and neuch tel  recognize official churches  which are either the catholic church or the  protestant  swiss reformed church  these churches  and in some cantons also the old catholic church and jewish congregations  are financed by official taxation of adherents

with any church or other religious body  agnostic  atheist  or just not related to any official religion            the country was historically about evenly balanced between catholic and protestant  with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country  one canton  appenzell  was officially divided into catholic and protestant sections in       the larger cities and their cantons  bern  geneva  lausanne  z rich and basel  used to be predominantly protestant  central switzerland  the valais  the ticino  appenzell innerrhodes  the jura  and fribourg are traditionally catholic  the swiss constitution of       under the recent impression of the clashes of catholic vs  protestant cantons that culminated in the sonderbundskrieg  consciously defines a consociational state  allowing the peaceful co existence of catholics and protestants  a      initiative calling for the complete separation of church and state was rejected by       of the voters     some traditionally protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight catholic majority  not because they were growing in members  quite the contrary  but only because since about      a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body        in switzerland        especially in traditionally protestant regions  such as basel city        canton of neuch tel        canton of geneva

in a wide range of traditional customs     a region may be in some ways strongly culturally connected to the neighbouring country that shares its language  the country itself being rooted in western european culture     the linguistically isolated romansh culture in graub nden in eastern switzerland constitutes an exception  it survives only in the upper valleys of the rhine and the inn and strives to maintain its rare linguistic tradition     switzerland is home to many notable contributors to literature  art  architecture  music and sciences  in addition the country attracted a number of creative persons during time of unrest or war in europe     some      museums are distributed through the country  the number has more than tripled since          among the most important cultural performances held annually are the lucerne festival     the montreux jazz festival    and the locarno international film festival        alpine symbolism has played an essential role in shaping the history of the country and the swiss national identity       nowadays some concentrated mountain areas have a strong highly energetic ski resort culture in winter  and a hiking  ger  das wandern  or mountain biking culture in summer  other areas throughout the year have a recreational culture that caters to tourism  yet the quieter seasons are spring and autumn when there are fewer visitors  a traditional farmer and herder culture also predominates in many areas and small farms are omnipresent outside the cities  folk art is kept alive in organisations all over the country  in switzerland it is mostly expressed in music  dance  poetry  wood carving and embroidery  the alphorn  a trumpet like musical instrument made of wood  has become alongside yodeling and the accordion an epitome of
