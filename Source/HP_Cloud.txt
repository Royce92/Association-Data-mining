stated that the company plans to invest over    billion in cloud over the next two years  hp helion includes hp s existing cloud products  new openstack technology based services  and both professional and support services to assist businesses in building and managing hybrid it environments      business organizations that want to use cloud computing have a choice of using a private cloud  which is a cloud infrastructure run specifically for a single organization that it built itself or by a third party  or a public cloud  whereby a service provider makes available applications  storage  and other resources to the general public    the decision of which to use is based on a number of factors  such as whether the company operates in a highly regulated sector  such as the pharmaceuticals industry that must comply with rules regarding the control and security of data  or if the business must bring services to market quickly  such as a web applications developer    the first would opt for a private cloud for security peace of mind  while the web developer would choose a public cloud offering    most companies would operate a mixture the two  also known as hybrid cloud delivery         employing a hybrid delivery cloud strategy   lets organizations use different cloud delivery services for specific applications    for instance  a public cloud may be a more cost effective service for the compute intensive task of processing analytics  but the data would remain local  or private  to comply with regulations    because a hybrid delivery strategy lets organizations run applications and services across different clouds  collocation  and data centers  an example benefit of such a delivery mechanism is that organizations can move an app from one geographic location to another in major storms       there can by different types of hybrid clouds for specific tasks    the infrastructure as a service  iaas  model can be a hybrid cloud in that it could use operating systems and virtualization technologies from both a public and private cloud infrastructure to provide cloud services  other models that mixes on premises cloud with public cloud technologies include platform as a service  paas   which includes infrastructure services combined with development tools and middleware  and software as a service  saas   which is used to develop packaged software       however  moving data in the cloud can be a difficult procedure    in the case of software as a service  saas   it is difficult particularly if the incumbent cloud provider used proprietary software  or if it altered an open source application       a way to mitigate cloud migration difficulties is to architect applications for the cloud that reduce or eliminate the dependencies between the cloud application stack and the capabilities of the cloud service provider    another way is to select only generic and higher level applications to move to the cloud in the first place    another method is to select open standards for cloud computing       a best practice for avoiding cloud migration problems is to use a management platform that can support applications in any environment a user organization is likely to use  this has been described as using a  best of breed  approach       companies engage cloud professional services consultants to help them plan how to incorporate cloud services into their business operations  consultants advise businesses on whether to use public  private  or a hybrid delivery model  and how they should implement or consume those delivery models    for example  cloud professional services consultants might recommend that businesses interested in cost savings place appropriate applications in the public cloud  but keep a higher security application in a private cloud or hybrid cloud       according to research conducted by hp in          percent of companies surveyed indicated that they wanted strategic guidance on how to deploy cloud    in a      competitive vendor analysis report by international data corporation  a market research firm  the authors state that cloud professional services can help companies map out both a short term and a long term strategy for how to use cloud in a way that aids their business goals       the most common reason businesses engage cloud professional services are for assistance with incorporating cloud technology into existing it environments  and to plan how to implement cloud  according to a study published in february      by the independent research firm technology business research  inc  according to published reports  the use of cloud professional services indicates that businesses do not have adequate internal resources that are knowledgeable about implementing cloud       hp cloud follows the premise of converged infrastructure  the integration of compute  storage  and networking components and technologies into self provisioning pools of shared resources  and supported by it services    one of the benefits of a data center based on converged infrastructure  including a converged infrastructure data center that delivers cloud services  is that manual tasks can be automated  thus reducing the time and cost to carry out them out       hp cloud is neutral regarding the manufacturer of cloud components used  such as virtual machine hypervisors  operating systems  and development environments    for example  hp cloud supports all hypervisors  including those from vmware  microsoft  and red hat       hp cloud is based on openstack technology      this allows user organizations to move cloud applications between hp cloud systems and other cloud systems based on openstack technology    the support for open standards technology enables user organizations to employ a hybrid delivery strategy for their cloud consumption    it also means private clouds based on converged infrastructure are compatible with public cloud platforms based on openstack technology  such as rackspace and nebula    the benefit is that user organization can decouple their applications from being tied to a particular hardware platform  user organizations may want to do this when they want to move key workloads to another infrastructure as a service supplier       hp cloudsystem is a component of hp cloud  it enables user organizations to burst workloads to external or internal cloud resources in times of increased workloads or when they want additional compute resources    this function is known as cloud bursting       hp cloud includes a number of packages for different industry sectors  for instance  hp cloud services for airlines integrates software as a service  saas  and infrastructure as a service  iaas  to the airline industry  applications for that include hp passenger service solution  which integrates travel and transportation industry applications into a single airline booking and travel saas environment
