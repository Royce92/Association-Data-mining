 quality of service  qos  is the overall performance of a telephony or computer network  particularly the performance seen by the users of the network     to quantitatively measure quality of service  several related aspects of the network service are often considered  such as error rates  bandwidth  throughput  transmission delay  availability  jitter  etc     quality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements  in particular  much technology has been developed to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations  as well as supporting new applications with even stricter service demands             in the field of telephony  quality of service was defined by the itu in        quality of service comprises requirements on all the aspects of a connection  such as service response time  loss  signal to noise ratio  crosstalk  echo  interrupts  frequency response  loudness levels  and so on  a subset of telephony qos is grade of service  gos  requirements  which comprises aspects of a connection relating to capacity and coverage of a network  for example guaranteed maximum blocking probability and outage probability      in the field of computer networking and other packet switched telecommunication networks  the traffic engineering term refers to resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality  quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications  users  or data flows  or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow  for example  a required bit rate  delay  jitter  packet dropping probability and or bit error rate may be guaranteed  quality of service guarantees are important if the network capacity is insufficient  especially for real time streaming multimedia applications such as voice over ip  online games and ip tv  since these often require fixed bit rate and are delay sensitive  and in networks where the capacity is a limited resource  for example in cellular data communication     a network or protocol that supports qos may agree on a traffic contract with the application software and reserve capacity in the network nodes  for example during a session establishment phase  during the session it may monitor the achieved level of performance  for example the data rate and delay  and dynamically control scheduling priorities in the network nodes  it may release the reserved capacity during a tear down phase     a best effort network or service does not support quality of service  an alternative to complex qos control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best effort network by over provisioning the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load  the resulting absence of network congestion eliminates the need for qos mechanisms     qos is sometimes used as a quality measure  with many alternative definitions  rather than referring to the ability to reserve resources  quality of service sometimes refers to the level of quality of service  i e  the guaranteed service quality   high qos is often confused with a high level of performance or achieved service quality  for example high bit rate  low latency and low bit error probability     an alternative and disputable definition of qos  used especially in application layer services such as telephony and streaming video  is requirements on a metric that reflects or predicts the subjectively experienced quality  in this context  qos is the acceptable cumulative effect on subscriber satisfaction of all imperfections affecting the service  other terms with similar meaning are the quality of experience  qoe  subjective business concept  the required  user perceived performance    the required  degree of satisfaction of the user  or the targeted  number of happy customers   examples of measures and measurement methods are mean opinion score  mos   perceptual speech quality measure  psqm  and perceptual evaluation of video quality  pevq   see also subjective video quality     conventional internet routers and lan switches operate on a best effort basis  this equipment is less expensive  less complex and faster and thus more popular than competing more complex technologies that provided qos mechanisms  there were four  type of service  bits and three  precedence  bits provided in each ip packet header  but they were not generally respected  these bits were later re defined as differentiated services code points  dscp  and are sometimes honored in peered links on the modern internet     with the advent of iptv and ip telephony  qos mechanisms are increasingly available to the end user     a number of attempts for layer   technologies that add qos tags to the data have gained popularity in the past  examples are frame relay  asynchronous transfer mode  atm  and multiprotocol label switching  mpls   a technique between layer   and     despite these network technologies remaining in use today  this kind of network lost attention after the advent of ethernet networks  today ethernet is  by far  the most popular layer   technology  ethernet may offer qos through its      p     in ethernet  virtual local area networks  vlan  may be used to separate different qos levels  for example fibre to the home switches typically offer several ethernet ports connected to different vlans  one vlan may be used for internet access  low priority   one for iptv  higher priority  and one for ip telephony  highest priority   different internet service providers may use different vlans     in packet switched networks  quality of service is affected by various factors  which can be divided into  human  and  technical  factors  human factors include  stability of service  availability of service  delays  user information  technical factors include  reliability  scalability  effectiveness  maintainability  grade of service  etc      many things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination  resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver     a defined quality of service may be desired or required for certain types of network traffic  for example     these types of service are called inelastic  meaning that they require a certain minimum level of bandwidth and a certain maximum latency to function  by contrast  elastic applications can take advantage of however much or little bandwidth is available  bulk file transfer applications that rely on tcp are generally elastic     circuit switched networks  especially those intended for voice transmission  such as asynchronous transfer mode  atm  or gsm  have qos in the core protocol and do not need additional procedures to achieve it  shorter data units and built in qos were some of the unique selling points of atm for applications such as video on demand     when the expense of mechanisms to provide qos is justified  network customers and providers can enter into a contractual agreement termed a service level agreement  sla  which specifies guarantees for the ability of a network protocol to give guaranteed performance throughput latency bounds based on mutually agreed measures  usually by prioritizing traffic  in other approaches  resources are reserved at each step on the network for the call as it is set up     an alternative to complex qos control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication by generously over provisioning a network so that capacity is based on peak traffic load estimates  this approach is simple for networks with predictable peak loads  the performance is reasonable for many applications  this might include demanding applications that can compensate for variations in bandwidth and delay with large receive buffers  which is often possible for example in video streaming  over provisioning can be of limited use  however  in the face of transport protocols  such as tcp  that over time exponentially increase the amount of data placed on the network until all available bandwidth is consumed and packets are dropped  such greedy protocols tend to increase latency and packet loss for all users     commercial voip services are often competitive with traditional telephone service in terms of call quality even though qos mechanisms are usually not in use on the user s connection to their isp and the voip provider s connection to a different isp  under high load conditions  however  voip may degrade to cell phone quality or worse  the mathematics of packet traffic indicate that network requires just     more raw capacity under conservative assumptions      the amount of over provisioning in interior links required to replace qos depends on the number of users and their traffic demands  this limits usability of over provisioning  newer more bandwidth intensive applications and the addition of more users results in the loss of over provisioned networks  this then requires a physical update of the relevant network links which is an expensive process  thus over provisioning cannot be blindly assumed on the internet     unlike single owner networks  the internet is a series of exchange points interconnecting private networks   hence the internet s core is owned and managed by a number of different network service providers  not a single entity  its behavior is much more stochastic or unpredictable  therefore  research continues on qos procedures that are deployable in large  diverse networks     there are two principal approaches to qos in modern packet switched ip networks  a parameterized system based on an exchange of application requirements with the network  and a prioritized system where each packet identifies a desired service level to the network     early work used the integrated services  intserv  philosophy of reserving network resources  in this model  applications used the resource reservation protocol  rsvp  to request and reserve resources through a network  while intserv mechanisms do work  it was realized that in a broadband network typical of a larger service provider  core routers would be required to accept  maintain  and tear down thousands or possibly tens of thousands of reservations  it was believed that this approach would not scale with the growth of the internet  and in any event was antithetical to the notion of designing networks so that core routers do little more than simply switch packets at the highest possible rates     in response to these markings  routers and switches use various queuing strategies to tailor performance to requirements  at the ip layer  dscp markings use the   bits in the ip packet header  at the mac layer  vlan ieee      q and ieee      p can be used to carry essentially the same information     routers supporting diffserv configure their network scheduler to use multiple queues for packets awaiting transmission from bandwidth constrained  e g   wide area  interfaces  router vendors provide different capabilities for configuring this behavior  to include the number of queues supported  the relative priorities of queues  and bandwidth reserved for each queue     in practice  when a packet must be forwarded from an interface with queuing  packets requiring low jitter  e g   voip or videoconferencing  are given priority over packets in other queues  typically  some bandwidth is allocated by default to network control packets  such as internet control message protocol and routing protocols   while best effort traffic might simply be given whatever bandwidth is left over     at the media access control  mac  layer  vlan ieee      q and ieee      p can be used to distinguish between ethernet frames and classify them  queueing theory models have been developed on performance analysis and qos for mac layer protocols       cisco ios netflow and the cisco class based qos  cbqos  management information base  mib  are marketed by cisco systems        one compelling example of the need for qos on the internet relates to congestion collapse  the internet relies on congestion avoidance protocols  as built into transmission control protocol  tcp   to reduce traffic under conditions that would otherwise lead to  meltdown   qos applications such as voip and iptv  because they require largely constant bitrates and low latency cannot use tcp and cannot otherwise reduce their traffic rate to help prevent congestion  qos contracts limit traffic that can be offered to the internet and thereby enforce traffic shaping that can prevent it from becoming overloaded  and are hence an indispensable part of the internet s ability to handle a mix of real time and non real time traffic without meltdown     end to end quality of service can require a method of coordinating resource allocation between one autonomous system and another  the internet engineering task force  ietf  defined the resource reservation protocol  rsvp  for bandwidth reservation  as a proposed standard in         rsvp is an end to end bandwidth reservation protocol  the traffic engineering

theme  and published a book      another european project  called widens  wireless deployable network system     proposed a bandwidth reservation approach for mobile wireless multirate adhoc networks   nin the services domain  end to end quality of service has also been discussed in the case of composite services  consisting of atomic services  or applications  consisting of application components       moreover  in cloud computing end to end qos has been the focus of various research efforts aiming at the provision of qos guarantees across the cloud service models       strong cryptography network protocols such as secure sockets layer  i p  and virtual private networks obscure the data transferred using them  as all electronic commerce on the internet requires the use of such strong cryptography protocols  unilaterally downgrading the performance of encrypted traffic creates an unacceptable hazard for customers  yet  encrypted traffic is otherwise unable to undergo deep packet inspection for qos     the internet  project found  in       that the qos protocols were probably not deployable inside its abilene network with equipment available at that time    equipment available at the time relied on software to implement qos  the group also predicted that  logistical  financial  and organizational barriers will block the way toward any bandwidth guarantees  by protocol modifications aimed at qos    they believed that the economics would encourage network providers to deliberately erode the quality of best effort traffic as a way to push customers to higher priced qos services  instead they proposed over provisioning of capacity as more cost effective at the time         the abilene network study was the basis for the testimony of gary bachula to the us senate commerce committee s hearing on network neutrality in early       he expressed the opinion that adding more bandwidth was more effective than any of the various schemes for accomplishing qos they examined       bachula s testimony has been cited by proponents of a law banning quality of service as proof that no legitimate purpose is served by such an offering  this argument is dependent on the assumption that over provisioning isn t a form of qos and that it is always possible  cost and other factors affect the ability of carriers to build and maintain permanently over provisioned networks
