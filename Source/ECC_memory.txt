 error correcting code memory  ecc memory  is a type of computer data storage that can detect and correct the most common kinds of internal data corruption  ecc memory is used in most computers where data corruption cannot be tolerated under any circumstances  such as for scientific or financial computing     ecc memory maintains a memory system immune to single bit errors  the data that is read from each word is always the same as the data that had been written to it  even if one or more bits actually stored have been flipped to the wrong state  most non ecc memory cannot detect errors although some non ecc memory with parity support allows detection but not correction             electrical or magnetic interference inside a computer system can cause a single bit of dynamic random access memory  dram  to spontaneously flip to the opposite state  it was initially thought that this was mainly due to alpha particles emitted by contaminants in chip packaging material  but research  has shown that the majority of one off soft errors in dram chips occur as a result of background radiation  chiefly neutrons from cosmic ray secondaries  which may change the contents of one or more memory cells or interfere with the circuitry used to read write them     as an example  the spacecraft cassini huygens  launched in       contains two identical flight recorders  each with    xa gigabits of memory in the form of arrays of commercial dram chips  thanks to built in edac functionality  spacecraft s engineering telemetry reports the number of  correctable  single bit per word errors and  uncorrectable  double bit per word errors  during the first    xa years of flight  the spacecraft reported a nearly constant single bit error rate of about    xa errors per day  however  on november          during the first month in space  the number of errors increased by more than a factor of four for that single day  this was attributed to a solar particle event that had been detected by the satellite goes        there was some concern that as dram density increases further  and thus the components on chips get smaller  while at the same time operating voltages continue to fall  dram chips will be affected by such radiation more frequently since lower energy particles will be able to change a memory cell s state  on the other hand  smaller cells make smaller targets  and moves to technologies such as soi may make individual cells less susceptible and so counteract  or even reverse  this trend  recent studies  show that single event upsets due to cosmic radiation have been dropping dramatically with process geometry and previous concerns over increasing bit cell error rates are unfounded     work published between      and      showed widely varying error rates with over   orders of magnitude difference  ranging from             error bit h  roughly one bit error  per hour  per gigabyte of memory to one bit error  per millennium  per gigabyte of memory     a very large scale study based on google s very large number of servers was presented at the sigmetrics performance    conference   the actual error rate found was several orders of magnitude higher than previous small scale or laboratory studies  with        to        errors per billion device hours per megabit  about      xa  xa      xa error bit h   i e  about   single bit errors in   gigabytes of ram per hour using the top end error rate   and more than    of dimm memory modules affected by errors per year     the consequence of a memory error is system dependent  in systems without ecc  an error can lead either to a crash or to corruption of data  in large scale production sites  memory errors are one of the most common hardware causes of machine crashes   memory errors can cause security vulnerabilities   a memory error can have no consequences if it changes a bit which neither causes observable malfunctioning nor affects data used in calculations or saved  a      simulation study showed that  for a web browser  only a small fraction of memory errors caused data corruption  although  as many memory errors are intermittent and correlated  the effects of memory errors were greater than would be expected for independent soft errors      some tests conclude that the isolation of dram memory cells can be circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to adjacent cells  thus  accessing data stored in dram causes memory cells to leak their charges and interact electrically  as a result of high cells density in modern memory  altering the content of nearby memory rows that actually were not addressed in the original memory access  this effect is known as row hammer  and it has also been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits       an example of a single bit error that would be ignored by a system with no error checking  would halt a machine with parity checking  or would be invisibly corrected by ecc  a single bit is stuck at   due to a faulty chip  or becomes changed to   due to background or cosmic radiation  a spreadsheet storing numbers in ascii format is loaded  and the digit     is stored in the byte which contains the stuck bit as its eighth bit  then a change is made to the spreadsheet and it is saved  however  the               binary  has silently become a                    several approaches have been developed to deal with unwanted bit flips  including immunity aware programming  ram parity memory  and ecc memory     this problem can be mitigated by using dram modules that include extra memory bits and memory controllers that exploit these bits  these extra bits are used to record parity or to use an error correcting code  ecc   parity allows the detection of all single bit errors  actually  any odd number of wrong bits   the most common error correcting code  a single error correction and double error detection  secded  hamming code  allows a single bit error to be corrected and  in the usual configuration  with an extra parity bit  double bit errors to be detected  chipkill ecc is a more effective version that also corrects for multiple bit errors  including the loss of an entire memory chip     seymour cray famously said  parity is for farmers  when asked why he left this out of the cdc         later  he included parity in the cdc       which caused pundits to remark that  apparently a lot of farmers buy computers   the original ibm pc and all pcs until the early     s used parity checking    later ones mostly did not  wider memory buses make parity and especially ecc more affordable  many current microprocessor memory controllers  including almost all amd    bit offerings  support ecc  but many motherboards and in particular those using low end chipsets do not  citation needed    in a few cases  systems with a non ecc memory controller can still gain most of the benefits of ecc memory by using eos memory modules     an ecc capable memory controller as used in many modern pcs  mostly medium  to high end workstation and server class  can detect and correct errors of a single bit per    bit  word   the unit of bus transfer   and detect  but not correct  errors of two bits per    bit word  the bios in some computers  when matched with operating systems such as some versions of linux  mac os  and windows citation needed allows counting of detected and corrected memory errors  in part to help identify failing memory modules before the problem becomes catastrophic     error detection and correction depends on an expectation of the kinds of errors that occur  implicitly  it is assumed that the failure of each bit in a word of memory is independent  resulting in improbability of two simultaneous errors  this used to be the case when memory chips were one bit wide  what was typical in the first half of the     s  later developments moved many bits into the same chip  this weakness is addressed by various technologies  including ibm s chipkill  sun microsystems  extended ecc  hewlett packard s chipspare  and intel s single device data correction  sddc      dram memory may provide increased protection against soft errors by relying on error correcting codes  such error correcting memory  known as ecc or edac protected memory  is particularly desirable for high fault tolerant applications  such as servers  as well as deep space applications due to increased radiation  some systems also  scrub  the memory  by periodically reading all addresses and writing back corrected versions if necessary to remove soft errors     interleaving allows for distribution of the effect of a single cosmic ray  potentially upsetting multiple physically neighboring bits across multiple words by associating neighboring bits to different words  as long as a single event upset  seu  does not exceed the error threshold  e g   a single error  in any particular word between accesses  it can be corrected  e g   by a single bit error correcting code   and an effectively error free memory system may be maintained       error correcting memory controllers traditionally use hamming codes  although some use triple modular redundancy  the latter is preferred because its hardware is faster than hamming error correction hardware    space satellite systems often use tmr        although satellite ram usually uses hamming error correction       many early implementations of ecc memory mask correctable errors  acting  as if  the error never occurred  and only report uncorrectable errors  modern implementations log both correctable errors  ce  and uncorrectable errors  ue   some people proactively replace memory modules that exhibit high error rates  in order to reduce the likelihood of uncorrectable error events       many ecc memory systems use an  external  edac circuit between the cpu and the memory  some dram chips include  internal  on chip error correction circuit      a few systems with ecc memory use both internal and external edac systems  the external edac system should be designed to correct certain errors that the internal edac system is unable to correct        modern desktop and server cpus integrate the edac circuit into the cpu    especially with the shift toward cpu integrated memory controllers  numa      as of       the most common error correction codes use hamming or hsiao codes that provide single bit error correction and double bit error detection  sec ded   other error correction codes have been proposed for protecting memory    double bit error correcting and triple bit error detecting  dec ted  codes  single nibble error correcting and double nibble error detecting  snc dnd  codes  reed solomon error correction codes  etc   but in practice multi bit correction is usually implemented by interleaving multiple sec ded codes         early research attempted to minimize area and delay in ecc circuits  hamming first demonstrated that sec ded codes were possible with one particular check matrix  hsiao showed that an alternative matrix with odd weight columns provides sec ded capability with less hardware area and shorter delay than traditional hamming sec ded codes  more recent research also attempts to minimize power in addition to minimizing area and delay            many processors use error correction codes in the on chip cache  including the intel itanium processor  the amd athlon and opteron processors  and the dec alpha               as of       edc ecc and ecc ecc are the two most common cache error protection techniques used in commercial microprocessors  the edc ecc technique uses an error detecting code  edc  in the level   cache  if an error is detected  data is recovered from ecc protected level   cache  the ecc ecc technique uses an ecc protected level   cache and an ecc protected level   cache     cpus that use the edc ecc technique always write through all stores to the level   cache  so that when an error is detected during a read from the level   data cache  a copy of that data can be recovered from the level   cache     registered  or buffered  memory is not the same as ecc  these strategies perform different functions  it is usual for memory used in servers to be both registered  to allow many memory modules to be used without electrical problems  and ecc  for data integrity  memory used in desktop computers is neither  for economy  however  unbuffered  not registered  ecc memory is available    and some non server motherboards support ecc functionality of such modules when used with a cpu that supports ecc    registered memory does not work reliably in motherboards without buffering circuitry  and vice versa     ultimately  there is a trade off between protection against unusual loss of data  and a higher cost     ecc protects against undetected memory data corruption  and is used in computers where such corruption is unacceptable  for example in some scientific and financial computing applications  or in file servers  ecc also reduces the number of crashes  particularly unacceptable in multi user server applications and maximum availability systems  most motherboards and processors for less critical application are not designed to support ecc so their prices can be kept lower  some ecc enabled boards and processors are able to support unbuffered  unregistered  ecc  but will also work with non ecc memory  system firmware enables ecc functionality if ecc ram is installed     ecc memory usually involves a higher price when compared to non ecc memory  due to additional hardware required for producing ecc memory modules  and due to lower production volumes of ecc memory and associated system hardware  motherboards  chipsets and processors that support ecc may also be more expensive     ecc may lower memory performance by around     percent on some systems  depending on application and implementation  due to the additional time needed for ecc memory controllers to perform error checking    however  modern systems integrate ecc testing into the cpu  generating no additional delay to memory accesses
