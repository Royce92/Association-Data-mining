 illumos is a free and open source unix operating system  it derives from opensolaris  which in turn derives from svr  unix and berkeley software distribution  bsd   illumos comprises a kernel  device drivers  system libraries  and utility software for system administration  this core forms the basis of several operating system distributions  see below   illumos has a similar role as the linux kernel  which forms the basis for different gnu linux distributions  thus  after the de facto demise of the open source opensolaris project there are different open sourced opensolaris distributions now based on the illumos kernel     the maintainers write illumos in lowercase since some computer fonts don t clearly distinguish a lowercase l from an uppercase i  the name is derived from the latin illuminare meaning  to enlighten   and  os  for  operating system              illumos was announced via webinar  on thursday    august       as a community effort of some core solaris engineers to create a truly open source solaris by swapping closed source bits of opensolaris with open implementations     the original plan explicitly stated that illumos would not be a distribution or a fork  however  after oracle announced discontinuing opensolaris  plans were made to fork the final version of the solaris on kernel allowing illumos to evolve into a kernel of its own      as of     update  efforts focused on libc  the nfs lock manager  the crypto module and many device drivers to create a solaris like os with no closed  proprietary code  as of     update  development emphasis includes transitioning from the historical compiler  studio  to gcc     illumos is lightly led by founder garrett d amore and other community members developers such as bryan cantrill and adam leventhal  via a developers  council      the illumos foundation has been incorporated in the state of california as a     c   trade association  with founding board members jason hoffman  formerly at joyent   evan powell  nexenta   and garrett d amore  as of august      the foundation was in the process of formalizing its by laws and organizational development     at openstorage summit       the new logo for illumos was revealed  with official type and branding to follow over      bryan cantrill s talk at lisa   fork yeah  the rise and development of illumos discusses the history of illumos and some of its strengths from a developer s perspective     its primary development project  illumos gate  derives from os net  aka on   which is a solaris kernel with the bulk of the drivers  core libraries  and basic utilities  similar to what is delivered by a bsd  src  tree  it was originally dependent on opensolaris os net  but a fork was made after oracle silently decided to close the development of solaris and unofficially killed the opensolaris project     official illumos distributions page
