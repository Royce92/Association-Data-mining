 xna is based on the  net framework  with versions that run on windows nt  windows phone and the xbox  in many respects  xna can be thought of as a  net analog to microsoft s better known game development system  directx  but it is aimed at developers primarily interested in writing lightweight games that run on a variety of microsoft platforms  xna is the basic platform for xbox live indie games     the xna toolset was announced march           at the game developers conference in san jose  california  a first community technology preview of xna build was released on march           xna game studio     was released in december       followed by xna game studio     on october           xna game studio     was released on september          along with the windows phone development tools  according to an email sent on    january       xna is no longer actively being developed   and it is not supported under the new  metro interface  layers of windows   nor on the windows rt platform              microsoft xna framework is based on the native implementation of  net compact framework     for xbox     development and  net framework     on windows  it includes an extensive set of class libraries  specific to game development  to promote maximum code reuse across target platforms  the framework runs on a version of the common language runtime that is optimized for gaming to provide a managed execution environment  the runtime is available for windows xp  windows vista  windows    windows phone and xbox      since xna games are written for the runtime  they can run on any platform that supports the xna framework with minimal or no modification  games that run on the framework can technically be written in any  net compliant language  but only c  in xna game studio express ide and all versions of visual studio      and       as of xna      not in citation given are officially supported  dead link support for visual basic  net was added in           the xna framework encapsulates low level technological details involved in coding a game  making sure that the framework itself takes care of the difference between platforms when games are ported from one compatible platform to another  and thereby allowing game developers to focus more on the content and gaming experience  the xna framework integrates with a number of tools  such as the cross platform audio creation tool  xact   to aid in content creation  the xna framework provides support for both  d and  d game creation and allows use of the xbox     controllers and vibrations  xna framework games that target the xbox platform can currently only be distributed by members of the microsoft xna creator s club which carries a     year subscription fee   desktop applications can be distributed free of charge under microsoft s current licensing     xna build is a set of game asset pipeline management tools  which help by defining  maintaining  debugging  and optimizing the game asset pipeline of individual game development efforts  a game asset pipeline describes the process by which game content  such as textures and  d models  are modified to a form suitable for use by the gaming engine  xna build helps identify the pipeline dependencies  and also provides api access to enable further processing of the dependency data  the dependency data can be analyzed to help reduce the size of a game by finding content that is not actually used  for example  xna build analysis revealed that     of the textures that shipped with mechcommander   were unused and could have been omitted      xna game studio is a programming environment for development of games   five revisions have been released so far     xna game studio express  the first release of xna game studio  was intended for students  hobbyists  and independent  and homebrew  game developers    it was available as a free download  express provides basic  starter kits  for rapid development of specific genres of games  such as platform games  real time strategy  and first person shooters  developers could create windows games for free with the xna framework  but to run their games on the xbox     they will have to pay an annual fee of us     or a four month fee of us     for admission to the microsoft xna creator s club  the initial release had no way of shipping precompiled binaries to other xbox     players  but this was changed in  xna game studio express     refresh  which made it possible to compile xbox     binaries and share them with other microsoft xna creator s club members     the first beta version of xna game studio express was released for download on august           followed by a second version on november          microsoft released the final version on december

microsoft xna framework     eula specifically prohibits the distribution of commercial networked games that connect to xbox live and or games for windows live in the absence of a specific agreement signed by both the developer and microsoft    this means that xna game studio can still be used to develop commercial games and other programs for the windows platform  although microsoft s networking support code for xbox windows live cannot be used  self developed network code can still be used inside the developer s xna project citation needed    games created using xna game studio may be distributed via xbox live indie games   and windows phone marketplace  the software may also be used to create commercial games which target windows citation needed    dream build play is an annual and global         microsoft contest promoting microsoft xna and eventually xbox live indie games  although it predated it  the contest was first announced in      and first opened in january

year   all games submitted to the app hub are subjected to peer review by other creators  if the game passes review then it is listed on xbox live marketplace  creators can set a price of         or     points for their game  the creator is paid     of the total revenue from their game sales as a baseline  microsoft originally planned to take an additional percentage of revenue if they provided additional marketing for a game  but this policy was rescinded in march       leaving the flat rate intact regardless of promotion       microsoft also distributes a free year premium app hub subscription for educational establishments through their dreamspark program and msdnaa  these accounts allow students to develop games for the xbox      but developers still need a premium xbox live account to submit their game to the marketplace     a project called mono xna was formed to port xna to the open source and cross platform mono framework       from the codebase of mono xna and silversprite  a new project called monogame was formed to port xna to several mobile devices      as of version        released march           support is stable for ios  android including ouya  mac os x  linux and metro for windows    windows rt and windows phone    as well as playstation mobile in  d  playstation mobile  d and raspberry pi development are currently in progress       an open

sharpdx stack  support for linux  mac os x and the playstation vita is in progress as well      using anx  developers are able to write games using code that is very similar to xna  while still being
