 uncertainty is a term used in subtly different ways in a number of fields  including philosophy  physics  statistics  economics  finance  insurance  psychology  sociology  engineering  and information science  it applies to predictions of future events  to physical measurements that are already made  or to the unknown  uncertainty arises in partially observable and or stochastic environments  as well as due to ignorance and or indolence              although the terms are used in various ways among the general public  many specialists in decision theory  statistics and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty  risk  and their measurement as     knightian uncertainty  in his seminal work risk  uncertainty  and profit         university of chicago economist frank knight established the important distinction between risk and uncertainty      there are other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions that include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective      there are some things that you know to be true  and others that you know to be false  yet  despite this extensive knowledge that you have  there remain many things whose truth or falsity is not known to you  we say that you are uncertain about them  you are uncertain  to varying degrees  about everything in the future  much of the past is hidden from you  and there is a lot of the present about which you do not have full information  uncertainty is everywhere and you cannot escape from it     for example  if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow  then there is a state of uncertainty  if probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a calibrated probability assessment  the uncertainty has been quantified  suppose it is quantified as a     chance of sunshine  if there is a major  costly  outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a     chance of rain  and rain would be undesirable  furthermore  if this is a business event and          would be lost if it rains  then the risk has been quantified a     chance of losing            these situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs  heavy rain  the cost of delays vs  outright cancellation  etc     some may represent the risk in this example as the  expected opportunity loss   eol  or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss                             that is useful if the organizer of the event is  risk neutral   which most people are not  most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss  an insurance company  for example  would compute an eol as a minimum for any insurance coverage  then add onto that other operating costs and profit  since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons  then clearly the eol alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk     quantitative uses of the terms uncertainty and risk are fairly consistent from fields such as probability theory  actuarial science  and information theory  some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk  for example  surprisal is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in information theory  but outside of the more mathematical uses of the term  usage may vary widely  in cognitive psychology  uncertainty can be real  or just a matter of perception  such as expectations  threats  etc     vagueness or ambiguity are sometimes described as  second order uncertainty   where there is uncertainty even about the definitions of uncertain states or outcomes  the difference here is that this uncertainty is about the human definitions and concepts  not an objective fact of nature  it has been argued that ambiguity  however  is always avoidable while uncertainty  of the  first order  kind  is not necessarily avoidable     uncertainty may be purely a consequence of a lack of knowledge of obtainable facts  that is  there may be uncertainty about whether a new rocket design will work  but this uncertainty can be removed with further analysis and experimentation  at the subatomic level  however  uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe  in quantum mechanics  the heisenberg uncertainty principle puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle  this may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found  there is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are  hidden variables  that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than heisenberg s uncertainty principle allows     in metrology  physics  and engineering  the uncertainty or margin of error of a measurement is stated by giving a range of values likely to enclose the true value  this may be denoted by error bars on a graph  or by the following notations     the middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value   for example   this can occur when using a logarithmic scale  for example  the latter  concise notation  is used for example by iupac in stating the atomic mass of elements  there  the uncertainty given in parenthesis applies to the least significant figure s  of the number prior to the parenthesized value  i e   counting from rightmost digit to left   for instance             stands for                  while             stands for                      often  the uncertainty of a measurement is found by repeating the measurement enough times to get a good estimate of the standard deviation of the values  then  any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation  however  if the values are averaged  then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty  equal to the standard error of the mean  which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements  this procedure neglects systematic errors  however     when the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement  then about       of the time  the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range  for example  it is likely that for       of the atomic mass values given on the list of elements by atomic mass  the true value lies outside of the stated range  if the width of the interval is doubled  then probably only      of the true values lie outside the doubled interval  and if the width is tripled  probably only      lie outside  these values follow from the properties of the normal distribution  and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors  in that case  the quoted standard errors are easily converted to         one sigma            two sigma    or         three sigma   confidence intervals citation needed    in this context  uncertainty depends on both the accuracy and precision of the measurement instrument  the lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument  the larger the measurement uncertainty is  notice that precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value  namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty  however  this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate  when it is inaccurate  the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures  and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision     uncertainty in science  and science in general  is often interpreted much differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community   this is due in part to the diversity of the public audience  and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively   one example is explained by the information deficit model  also  in the public realm  there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic   for example  depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere  discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist   this interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted  as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals  for example  global warming contrarian activists took the advice of frank luntz to frame global warming as an issue of scientific uncertainty  which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue       indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known  whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known    these unknowns  indeterminacy and ignorance  that exist in science are often  transformed  into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable  since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility   conversely  uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance   the transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public s misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance     journalists often either inflate uncertainty  making the science seem more uncertain than it really is  or downplay uncertainty  making the science seem more certain than it really is     one way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change   other times  journalists give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views  without adequately describing or explaining the state of scientific consensus on the issue    in the same vein  journalists often give non scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists       journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating  scientists  carefully chosen tentative wording  and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is     also  stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality    there is often a  product over process  approach to science journalism that aids  too  in the downplaying of uncertainty    finally  and most notably for this investigation  when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest  uncertainty is erroneously framed as  reducible and resolvable        some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty  other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue  because the general public  in the united states  generally trusts scientists  when science stories are covered without alarm raising cues from special interest organizations  religious groups  environmental organization  political factions  etc   they are often covered in a business related sense  in an economic development frame or a social progress frame    the nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty  so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle  as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the united states  the matter in question seems more definitive and certain       sometimes  too  stockholders  owners  or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue  and therefore any uncertainty claims that may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated       the most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the  guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement   gum  published by iso  a derived work is for example the national institute for standards and technology  nist  technical note        guidelines for evaluating and expressing the uncertainty of nist measurement results   and the eurachem citac publication  quantifying uncertainty in analytical measurement   the uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components  the components are regarded as random variables  and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values
