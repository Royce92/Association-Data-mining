 the world wide web has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains  in addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality  these web applications exhibit complex behavior and place some unique demands on their usability  performance  security and ability to grow and evolve  however  a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad hoc way  contributing to problems of usability  maintainability  quality and reliability    while web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines  it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations  in recent years  there have been developments towards addressing these considerations     as an emerging discipline  web engineering actively promotes systematic  disciplined and quantifiable approaches towards successful development of high quality  ubiquitously usable web based systems and applications   in particular  web engineering focuses on the methodologies  techniques and tools that are the foundation of web application development and which support their design  development  evolution  and evaluation  web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software  information system  or computer application development     web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas  systems analysis and design  software engineering  hypermedia hypertext engineering  requirements engineering  human computer interaction  user interface  information engineering  information indexing and retrieval  testing  modelling and simulation  project management  and graphic design and presentation  web engineering is neither a clone  nor a subset of software engineering  although both involve programming and software development  while web engineering uses software engineering principles  it encompasses new approaches  methodologies  tools  techniques  and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of web based applications             proponents of web engineering supported the establishment of web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of web  first workshop on web engineering was held in conjunction with world wide web conference held in brisbane  australia  in       san murugesan  yogesh deshpande  steve hansen and athula ginige  from university of western sydney  australia formally promoted web engineering as a new discipline in the first icse workshop on web engineering in        since then they published a series of papers in a number of journals  conferences and magazines to promote their view and got wide support  major arguments for web engineering as a new discipline are     however  it has been controversial  especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering  to recognize web engineering as a new field  the issue is how different and independent web engineering is  compared with other disciplines     main topics of web engineering include  but are not limited to  the following areas
