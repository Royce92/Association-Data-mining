 a home video game console or simply home console is a video game device that is primarily used for home gamers  home consoles are one type of video game consoles  in contrast to the handheld game consoles which are smaller and portable  allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place  as well as the microconsoles and the dedicated consoles             although the first video games appeared in the     s   they were played on massive computers connected to vector displays  not analog televisions  ralph h  baer conceived the idea of a home video game in       in the late     s while working for sanders associates he created a series of video game console designs  one of these designs  which gained the nickname of the  brown box   featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several tv manufactures ultimately leading to an agreement between sanders associates and magnavox      in      magnavox released the magnavox odyssey  the first home video game console which could be connected to a tv set  ralph baer s initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow gamers to turn on and off certain components of the console  the odyssey lacked a cpu  to create slightly different games like tennis  volleyball  hockey  and chase  magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game  although baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games  the carts released by magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed gamers to choose from the odyssey s built in games     the odyssey only initially sold about         units    making it moderately successful  and it was not until atari s arcade game pong popularized video games  that the public began to take more notice of the emerging industry  by autumn       magnavox  bowing to the popularity of pong  cancelled the odyssey and released a scaled down version that played only pong and hockey  the odyssey      a second   higher end  console  the odyssey      was released with the     and added on screen scoring  up to four players  and a third game smash  almost simultaneously released with atari s own home pong console through sears  these consoles jump started the consumer market  all three of the new consoles used simpler designs than the original odyssey with no board game pieces or extra cartridges     in the years that followed  the market saw many companies rushing similar consoles to market  after general instrument released their inexpensive microchips  each containing a complete console on a single chip  many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally  but internally were playing exactly the same games     most of the consoles from this era were dedicated consoles playing only the games that came with the console  these video game consoles were often just called video games  because there was little reason to distinguish the two yet  while a few companies like atari  magnavox  and newcomer coleco pushed the envelope  the market became flooded with simple  similar video games     fairchild released the fairchild video entertainment system  ves  in       while there had been previous game consoles that used cartridges  either the cartridges had no information and served the same function as flipping switches  the odyssey  or the console itself was empty  coleco telstar  and the cartridge contained all of the game components  the ves  however  contained a programmable microprocessor so its cartridges only needed a single rom chip to store microprocessor instructions     rca and atari soon released their own cartridge based consoles  the rca studio ii and the atari       originally branded as the atari video computer system   respectively  both bally  with their home library computer in       and magnavox  with the odyssey  in       also brought their own programmable cartridge based consoles to the market  however  it was not until atari released a conversion of the golden age arcade hit space invaders in      for the atari      that the home console industry took off  many consumers bought an atari console so they could play space invaders at home  space invadersu   a u   b unprecedented success started the trend of console manufacturers trying to get exclusive rights to arcade titles  and the trend of advertisements for game consoles claiming to bring the arcade experience home     throughout the early     s  other companies released video game consoles of their own  many of the video game systems were technically superior to the atari       and marketed as improvements over the atari       but atari dominated the console market in the early     s  however  a severe crash occurred in      in the video game business     in       nintendo released the family computer  or famicom  in japan  the famicom supported high resolution sprites  larger color palettes  and tiled backgrounds  this allowed famicom games to be longer and have more detailed graphics  nintendo began attempts to bring their famicom to the u s  after the video game market had crashed  in the u s   video games were seen as a fad that had already passed  to distinguish its product from older game consoles  nintendo released their famicom as the nintendo entertainment system  nes  which used a front loading cartridge port similar to a vcr  included a plastic  robot   r o b   and was initially advertised as a toy      the nes was the highest selling console in the history of north america and revitalized the video game market  mario of super mario bros became a global icon starting with his nes games  nintendo took an unusual stance with third party developers for its console  nintendo contractually restricted third party developers to three nes titles per year and forbade them from developing for other video game consoles  the practice ensured nintendo s market dominance and prevented the flood of trash titles that had helped kill the atari  but was ruled illegal late in the console s life cycle     sega s master system was intended to compete with the nes  but never gained any significant market share in the us or japan and was barely profitable  it fared notably better in pal territories  in europe and south america  the master system competed with the nes and saw new game releases even after sega s next generation mega drive was released  in brazil where strict importation laws and rampant piracy kept out competitors  the master system outsold the nes by a massive margin and remained popular into the    s      jack tramiel  after buying atari  downsizing its staff  and settling its legal disputes  attempted to bring atari back into the home console market  atari released a smaller  sleeker  cheaper version of their popular atari       they also released the atari       a console technologically comparable with the nes and backwards compatible with the       finally atari repackaged its   bit xe home computer as the xegs game console  the new consoles helped atari claw its way out of debt  but failed to gain much market share from nintendo  atari s lack of funds meant that its consoles saw fewer releases  lower production values  both the manuals and the game labels were frequently black and white   and limited distribution     nec brought the first fourth generation console to market with their pc engine  or turbografx    when hudson soft approached them with an advanced graphics chip  hudson had previously approached nintendo  only to be rebuffed by a company still raking in the profits of the nes  the turbografx used the unusual hucard format to store games  the small size of these proprietary cards allowed nec to re release the console as a handheld game console  the pc engine enjoyed brisk sales in japan  but its north american counterpart  the turbografx  lagged behind the competition  the console never saw an official release in europe  but clones and north american imports were available in some markets starting in          nec advertised their console as     bit  to highlight its advances over the nes  this started the trend of all subsequent fourth generations consoles being advertised as    bit  many people still refer to this generation as the    bit generation  and often refer to the third generation as    bit      sega scaled down and adapted their sega system     used to power arcade hits like altered beast and shinobi  into the mega drive  or genesis  and released it with a near arcade perfect port of altered beast  sega s console met lukewarm sales in japan  but skyrocketed to first place in pal markets  and made major inroads in north america  propelled by its effective  genesis does what nintendon t  marketing campaign  sega capitalized on the genesis s technological superiority over the nes  faithful ports of popular arcade games  and competitive pricing     arcade gaming company  snk developed the high end neo geo mvs arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar to home consoles  building on the success of the mvs  snk repackaged the neogeo as the neo geo aes home console  though technologically superior to the other fourth generation consoles  the aes and its games were prohibitively expensive  which kept sales low and prevented it from expanding outside its niche market and into serious competition with nintendo and sega  the aes did  however  amass a dedicated cult following  allowing it to see new releases into the     s     the fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles to reproduce the art styles that were becoming popular in arcades and on home computers  these games often featured lavish background scenery  huge characters  broader color pallettes  and increased emphasis on dithering and texture  games written specifically for the nes  like megaman  shatterhand  and super mario bros   were able to work cleverly within its limitations  ports of the increasingly detailed arcade and home computer games came up with various solutions  for example when capcom released strider in the arcade they created an entirely separate strider game for the nes that only incorporated themes and characters from the arcade     in      nintendo finally brought their super famicom to market and brought it to the us as the super nintendo entertainment system  snes  a year later  its release marginalized the turbografx and the neo geo  but came late enough for sega to sell several million consoles in north america and gain a strong foothold  the same year the snes was released sega released sonic the hedgehog  which spiked genesis sales  similar to space invaders on the atari  also  by      the first fully licensed nfl football game was released  nfl sports talk football      which was available only on the genesis  this impact on genesis sales  and the overall interest of realistic sports games  would start the trend of licensed sports games being viewed as necessary for the success of a console in the us     while nintendo enjoyed dominance in japan  and sega in europe  the competition between the two was particularly fierce and close in north america  ultimately  the snes outsold the genesis  but only after sega discontinued the genesis to focus on the next generation of consoles     one trait that remains peculiar to the fourth generation is the huge number of exclusive games  both sega and nintendo were very successful and their consoles developed massive libraries of games  both consoles had to be programmed in assembly to get the most out of them  a game optimized for the genesis could take advantage of its faster cpu and sound chip  a game optimized for the snes could take advantage of its graphics and its flexible  clean sound chip  some game series  like castlevania  saw separate system exclusive releases rather than an attempt to port one game to disparate platforms     when compact disc  cd  technology became available midway through the fourth generation  each company attempted to integrate it into their existing consoles in different ways  nec and sega released cd add ons to their consoles in the form of the pc engine cd and sega cd  but both were only moderately successful  nec also released the turboduo which combined the pc engine and its cd add on into one machine  which could read hucards and compact discs  snk released a third version of the neogeo  the neo geo cd  allowing the company to release its games on a cheaper medium than the aes s expensive cartridges  but it reached the market after nintendo and sega had already sold tens of millions of consoles each  nintendo partnered with sony to work on a cd addon for the snes  but the deal fell apart when they realized how much control sony wanted  sony would use their work with nintendo as the basis for their playstation game console  while cds became an increasingly visible part of the market  cd reading technology was still expensive in the   s  limiting nec s and sega s add ons  sales     the first fifth generation consoles were the  do and the atari jaguar  although both consoles were more powerful than the fourth generation systems  neither would become serious threats to sega or nintendo  the  do initially generated a great deal of hype in part because of a licensing scheme where  do licensed the manufacturing of its console out to third parties  similar to vcr or dvd players  unfortunately  that very structure meant that unlike its competitors who could sell the console at a loss  all  do manufacturers had to sell for profit  the cheapest  do was more expensive than the snes and genesis combined     atari cancelled their line of home computers  their atari portfolio  the stacy laptop  and their handheld atari lynx when they released the jaguar  it was an all or nothing gamble that ran the company into the ground  the jaguar had three processors and no c libraries to help developers cope with it  atari was ineffective at courting third parties and many of their first party games were poorly received  while games like tempest       rayman  and alien vs predator showed what the console was capable of  the vast majority of releases underwhelmed  many of the jaguar s games used mainly the slowest  but most familiar  of the console s processors  resulting in titles that could easily have been released on the snes or genesis     to compete with emerging next gen consoles  nintendo released donkey kong country which could display a wide range of tones  something common in fifth generation games  by limiting the number of hues onscreen  and star fox which used an extra chip inside of the cartridge to display polygon graphics  sega followed suit  releasing vectorman and virtua racing  the latter of which used the sega virtua processor   sega also released the sega   x  an add on for the genesis  while their sega saturn was still in development  and announced that they would replace the genesis with the neptune  a combination   x and genesis  and sell it as a budget console alongside their upcoming saturn  despite public statements from sega claiming that they would continue to support the genesis   x throughout the next generation  sega of japan quietly killed the neptune project and forced sega of america to abandon the   x  the   x s brief and confusing existence damaged public perception of the coming saturn and sega as a whole     while the fourth generation had seen a handful of acclaimed titles on nec s pc engine cd and sega s mega cd add ons  it wasn t until the fifth generation that a cd based consoles and games began to seriously compete with cartridges  cds were significantly cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were  and gave developers room to add cinematic cut scenes  pre recorded soundtracks  and voice acting that made more serious storytelling possible     nec had been developing a successor to the pc engine as early as       and presented a prototype  dubbed the  iron man   to developers in       but shelved the project as the pc engine cd managed to extend the console s market viability in japan into the mid   s  when sales started to dry up  nec rushed its old project to the market  the pc fx  a cd based     bit console  had highly advanced  detailed  d graphics capabilities  and better full motion video than any other system on the market  it was  however  incapable of handling  d graphics  forfeiting its chances at seriously competing with sony and sega  the console was limited to a niche market of dating sims and visual novels in japan  and never saw release in western markets     after the abortive   x  sega entered the fifth generation with the saturn  sega released several highly regarded titles for the saturn  but a series of bad decisions alienated many developers and retailers  while the saturn was technologically advanced  it was also complex  difficult  and unintuitive to write games for  in particular  programming  d graphics that could compete with those on nintendo and sony s consoles proved exceptionally difficult for third party developers  because the saturn used quadrilaterals  rather than standard triangles  as its basic polygon  cross platform games had to be completely rewritten to see a saturn port  the saturn was also a victim of internal politics at sega  while the saturn sold comparably well in japan  sega s branches in north america and europe refused to license localizations of many popular japanese titles  holding they were ill suited to western markets  first party hits like sakura taisen never saw western releases  while several third party titles released on both playstation and saturn in japan  like grandia and castlevania  symphony of the night  were released in north america and europe as playstation exclusives     born from a failed attempt to create a console with nintendo  sony s playstation would not only dominate its generation  but become the first console to sell over     million units by expanding the video game market  sony actively courted third parties and provided them with convenient c libraries to write their games  sony had built the console from the start as a  d  disc based system  and emphasized its  d graphics that would come to be viewed as the future of gaming  the playstation s cd technology won over several developers who had been releasing titles for nintendo and sega s fourth generation consoles  such as konami  namco  capcom  and square  cds were far cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were  meaning developers could release larger batches of games at higher profit margins  nintendo s console  on the other hand  used cartridges  unwittingly keeping third party developers away  the playstation s internal architecture was simpler and more intuitive to program for  giving the console an edge over sega s saturn     nintendo was the last to release a fifth generation console with their nintendo     and when they finally released their console it came with only two launch titles  partly to curb piracy and partly as a result of nintendo s failed disc projects with sony and phillips  nintendo used cartridges for their console  the higher cost of cartridges drove many third party developers to the playstation  the nintendo    could handle  d polygons better than any console released before it  but its games often lacked the cut scenes  soundtracks  and voice overs that became standard on playstation discs  nintendo released several highly acclaimed titles  such as super mario    and the legend of zelda  ocarina of time  and the nintendo    was able to sell tens of millions of units on the strength of first party titles alone  but its constant struggles against sony would make the nintendo    the last home console to use cartridges as a medium for game distribution     the sixth generation saw a move towards pc like architectures in gaming consoles  as well as a shift towards using dvds for game media  this brought games that were both longer and more visually appealing  furthermore  this generation also saw experimentation with online console gaming and implementing both flash and hard drive storage for game data     the features introduced in this generation include the support of new disc formats  blu ray disc  utilized by the playstation    and hd dvd supported by the xbox     via an optional      external accessory addition  that was later discontinued as the format war closed  another new technology is the use of motion as input  and ir tracking  as implemented on the wii   also  all seventh generation consoles support wireless controllers  this generation also introduces the nintendo ds  and the nintendo dsi  which add touch screens and cameras to portable gaming     aside from the usual hardware enhancements  consoles of the eighth generation focus on further integration with other media and increased connectivity   the  ds introduced autostereoscopic  d on consoles  the wii u introduced a controller tablet hybrid whose features include the possibility of augmented reality in gaming   the playstation   is sony s eighth generation console  featuring a  share  button to stream video game content between devices  released on november           microsoft released their next generation console  the xbox one  on november                game systems in the eighth generation also faced increasing competition from mobile device platforms such as apple s ios and google s android operating systems  smartphone ownership was estimated to reach roughly a quarter of the world s population by the end of         the proliferation of low cost games for these devices  such as angry birds with over   billion downloads worldwide    presents a new challenge to classic video game systems  microconsoles  cheaper stand alone devices designed to play games from previously established platforms  also increased options for consumers  many of these projects were spurred on by the use of new crowdfunding techniques through sites such as kickstarter  notable competitors include the gamepop  ouya  and gamestick android based systems  the playstation vita tv  and the forthcoming steam machine       despite the increased competition  the sales for major console manufacturers featured strong starts  the playstation   sold   million consoles within    hours in   countries  whilst the xbox one sold   million consoles within    hours in    countries    as of april         million playstation   consoles have been sold worldwide    and   million xbox one units have shipped    both outpacing sales of their seventh generation systems  in may  nintendo announced that it had sold only     million wii u consoles  falling far short of their forecasts       game cartridges consist of a printed circuit board housed inside of a plastic casing  with a connector allowing the device to interface with the console  the circuit board can contain a wide variety of components  all cartridge games contain at the minimum  read only memory with the software written on it  many cartridges also carry components that increase the original console s power  such as extra ram or a coprocessor  components can also be added to extend the original hardware s functionality    such as gyroscopes  rumble packs  tilt sensors  light sensors  etc    this is more common on handheld consoles where the user does not interact with the game through a separate video game controller       cartridges were the first external media to be used with home consoles and remained the most common until      continued improvements in capacity  nintendo    being the last mainstream game console to use cartridges     nevertheless  the relatively high manufacturing costs saw them completely replaced by optical media for home consoles by the early   st century  although they are still in use in some handheld video game consoles     due to the aforementioned capabilities of cartridges such as more memory and coprocessors  those factors make it harder to reverse engineer consoles to be used on emulators     several consoles such as the sega master system and the turbografx    have used different types of smart cards as an external medium  these cards function similar to simple cartridges  information is stored on a chip that is housed in plastic  cards are more compact and simpler than cartridges  though  this makes them cheaper to produce and smaller  but limits what can be done with them  cards cannot hold extra components  and common cartridge techniques like bank switching  a technique used to create very large games  were impossible to miniaturize into a card in the late     s         compact discs reduced much of the need for cards  optical discs can hold more information than cards  and are cheaper to produce  the nintendo gamecube and the playstation   use memory cards for storage  but the ps vita and nintendo  ds are currently the only modern systems to use cards for game distribution  nintendo has long used cartridges with their game boy line of hand held consoles because of their durability  small size  stability  not shaking and vibrating the handheld when it is in use   and low battery consumption  nintendo switched to cards starting with the ds  because advances in memory technology made putting extra memory on the cartridge unnecessary    the playstation vita uses sony s own proprietary flash memory vita cards as one method of game distribution       home computers have long used magnetic storage devices  both tape drives and floppy disk drives were common on early microcomputers  their popularity is in large part because a tape drive or disk drive can write to any material it can read  however  magnetic media is volatile and can be more easily damaged than game cartridges or optical discs       among the first consoles to use magnetic media were the bally astrocade and apf m      both of which could use cassette tapes through expansions  in bally s case  this allowed the console to see new game development even after bally dropped support for it  while magnetic media remained limited in use as a primary form of distribution  three popular subsequent consoles also had expansions available to allow them to use this format  the starpath supercharger can load atari      games from audio cassettes  starpath used it to cheaply distribute their own games from      to      and today it is used by many programmers to test  distribute  and play homebrew software  the famicom disk system  a floppy disk reading add on to the famicom  as the nes was known in japan   was released by nintendo in      for the japanese market  nintendo sold the disks cheaply and sold vending machines where customers could have new games written to their disks up to     times    in       nintendo released another japan only floppy disk add on  the nintendo   dd  for the nintendo        in the mid     s  various manufacturers shifted to optical media  specifically cd rom  for games  although they were slower at loading game data than the cartridges available at that time  they were significantly cheaper to manufacture and had a larger capacity than the existing cartridge technology  sega released the second cd based gaming system with the mega cd in japan on december           commodore followed shortly after with the amiga cd   in september       the first    bit game console  by the early   st century  all of the major home consoles used optical media  usually dvd rom or similar disks  which are widely replacing cd rom for data storage  the playstation   system uses even higher capacity blu ray optical discs for games and movies while the xbox     formerly used hd dvds in the form of an external usb player add on for movies  before it was discontinued  however  microsoft still supports those who bought the accessory     all three seventh generation consoles  the playstation    wii  and xbox      offer some kind of internet games distribution service  allowing users to download games for a fee onto some form of non volatile storage  typically a hard disk or flash memory  recently  the console manufacturers have been taking advantage of internet distribution with games  video streaming services like netflix  hulu plus and film trailers being available     each new generation of console hardware made use of the rapid development of processing technology  newer machines could output a greater range of colors  more sprites  and introduced graphical technologies such as scaling  and vector graphics  one way console makers marketed these advances to consumers was through the measurement of  bits   the turbografx     sega genesis  and snes were among the first consoles to advertise the fact that they contained    bit processors  this fourth generation of console hardware was often referred to as the    bit era  and the previous generation as the   bit     the bit value of a console referred to the word length of a console s processor  although the value was sometimes misused  for example the turbografx    had only an   bit cpu  and the genesis mega drive had the       bit motorola        but both had a    bit dedicated graphics processor   as the graphical performance of console hardware is dependent on many factors  using bits was a crude way to gauge a console s overall ability  for example the nes  commodore     apple ii  and atari      all used a very similar   bit cpu  the difference in their processing power is due to other causes  for example the commodore    contains    kilobytes of ram and the atari has much less at     bytes of ram     the jump from   bit machines to    bit machines to    bit machines made a noticeable difference in performance  so consoles from certain generations are frequently referred to as   bit or    bit consoles  however  the  bits  in a console are no longer a major factor in their performance  the nintendo     for example has been outpaced by several    bit machines
