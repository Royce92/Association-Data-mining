 tru   unix is a    bit unix operating system for the alpha instruction set architecture  isa   currently owned by hewlett packard  hp   previously  tru   unix was a product of compaq  and before that  digital equipment corporation  dec   where it was known as digital unix  formerly dec osf   axp      as its original name suggests  tru   unix is based on the osf   operating system  dec s previous unix product was known as ultrix and was based on bsd     it is unusual among commercial unix implementations  as it is built on top of the mach kernel developed at carnegie mellon university   other unix implementations built on top of the mach kernel are nextstep  mklinux  mac os x and apple ios      tru   unix requires the srm boot firmware found on alpha based computer systems             in       during the so called  unix wars   dec joined with ibm  hewlett packard  and others to form the open software foundation  osf  to develop a version of unix  dubbed osf    the aim was to compete with system v release   from at t corporation and sun microsystems  and it has been argued that a primary goal was for the operating system to be free of at t intellectual property   the fact that osf   was one of the first operating systems to use the mach kernel is cited as support of this assertioncitation needed  digital also strongly promoted osf   for real time applicationscitation needed  and with traditional unix implementations at the time providing poor real time support at best  the real time and multi threading support was heavily dependent on the mach kernel  it also incorporated a large part of the bsd kernel  based on the     reno release  to provide unix compatibility  osf   was envisaged to be the third major branch of the unix family tree  after system v and bsd     dec s original release of osf    osf   release      was in january      for their line of mips based decstation workstations   however this was never a fully supported product and was cancelled before the end of the year  dec ported osf   to their new alpha axp platform  as dec osf   axp   and this was the first version  release      of what is most commonly referred to as osf    dec osf   axp release     was shipped on march       osf   axp was a full    bit operating system and the native unix implementation for the alpha architecture  from osf   axp v    onwards  unix system v compatibility was also integrated into the system     hp also released a port of osf   to the early hp          workstations based on the pa risc     architecture  this was withdrawn soon afterwards due to lack of software and hardware support compared to competing operating systems      apple computer intended to base a ux     for their powerpc based macintoshes on osf     but the project was cancelled     ibm used osf   as the basis of the aix esa operating system for system     and system     mainframes      osf   was also ported by kendall square research to their proprietary processor architecture used in the ksr  supercomputer     in       after at t had sold unix system v to novell and the rival unix international consortium had disbanded  the open software foundation ceased funding of research and development of osf       osf   ad  advanced development  was a distributed version of osf   developed for massively parallel supercomputers by locus computing corporation   variants of osf   ad were used on several such systems  including the intel paragon xp s and asci red  convex exemplar spp       as spp ux  and the hitachi sr      as hi ux mpp      in       starting with release      dec renamed osf   axp to digital unix to reflect its conformance with the x open single unix specification      after compaq s purchase of dec in early       with the release of version    f  digital unix was renamed to tru   unix to emphasise its    bit clean nature and de emphasise the digital brand     in april       compaq announced that tru   unix     successfully ran on intel s ia    simulator   however  this port was cancelled a few months later       a chinese version of tru   unix named cosix was jointly developed by compaq and china national computer software   technology service corporation  cs s     it was released in          from release v    tru   unix offered a clustering facility named trucluster server  trucluster utilised a cluster wide filesystem visible to each cluster member  plus member specific storage and an optional quorum disk  member specific files paths were enhanced symbolic links incorporating the member id of the owning member  each member had one or zero votes  which  combined with a possible quorum disk  implemented a cluster formation algorithm similar to that found in openvms     with their purchase of compaq in       hp announced their intention to migrate many of tru   unix s more innovative features  including its advfs  trucluster  and lsm  to hp ux  in december       hp announced a change of plan  they would instead use the veritas file system and abandon the tru   advanced features  in the process  many of the remaining tru   developers were laid off       the current maintenance release     b   was released in october            in october       hp stated that they would continue to support tru   unix until    december            in       hp has contributed the advfs to the open source community       these versions were released for alpha axp platforms
