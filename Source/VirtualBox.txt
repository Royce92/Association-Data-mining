 oracle vm virtualbox  formerly sun virtualbox  sun xvm virtualbox and innotek virtualbox  is a virtualization software package for x   and amd   intel   based computers from oracle corporation  innotek gmbh first developed the product  sun microsystems purchased it in       oracle has continued development since          the virtualbox package installs on an existing host operating system as an application  this host application allows additional guest operating systems  each known as a guest os  to load and run  each with its own virtual environment     supported host operating systems include linux  mac os x  windows xp  windows vista  windows    windows    solaris  and opensolaris  there are also ports to freebsd  and genode      supported guest operating systems include versions and derivations of windows  linux  bsd  os    solaris  haiku and others   since release        virtualbox also allows limited virtualization of mac os x guests on apple hardware  though osx   can also be installed using virtualbox       since version      released in october         microsoft windows guests on supported hardware can take advantage of the recently implemented wddm driver included in the guest additions  this allows windows aero to be enabled along with direct d support     guest additions should be installed in order to achieve the best possible experience    the guest additions can be installed inside a virtual machine after the installation of the guest operating system  they consist of device drivers and system applications that optimize the guest operating system for better performance and usability               virtualbox was initially offered by innotek gmbh from weinstadt  germany under a proprietary software license  making one version of the product available at no cost for personal or evaluation use  subject to the virtualbox personal use and evaluation license  puel     in january       based on counsel by lisog  innotek gmbh released virtualbox open source edition  ose  as free and open source software  subject to the requirements of the gnu general public license  gpl   version         innotek gmbh also contributed to the development of os   and linux support in virtualization   and os   ports   of products from connectix which were later acquired by microsoft  specifically  innotek developed the  additions  code in both microsoft virtual pc and microsoft virtual server  which enables various host guest os interactions like shared clipboards or dynamic viewport resizing     sun microsystems acquired innotek in february                oracle corporation acquired sun in january      and re branded the product as  oracle vm virtualbox            with version   of virtualbox  released in december       the core package is free software released under gnu general public license version    gplv    this is the fully featured package  excluding some proprietary components not available under gplv   these components provide support for usb     devices  remote desktop protocol  rdp  and preboot execution environment  pxe  for intel cards and are released as a separate  virtualbox oracle vm virtualbox extension pack  under a proprietary personal use and evaluation license  puel   which permits use of the software for personal use  educational use  or evaluation  free of charge       oracle defines personal use as any situation in which one person installs the software  and only that individual  and their friends and family  use the software  oracle does not care if that use is for commercial or non commercial purposes    oracle would consider it non personal use  for example  if a network administrator installed many copies of the software on many different machines  on behalf of many different end users  that type of situation would require purchasing a special volume license     prior to version    there were two different packages of the virtualbox software  the full package was offered free under the puel  with licenses for other commercial deployment purchasable from oracle  a second package called the virtualbox open source edition  ose  was released under gplv   this removed the same proprietary components not available under gplv          virtualbox requires the use of the open watcom compiler to build the bios since version           although virtualbox has experimental support for mac os x guests  the end user license agreement of mac os x does not permit the operating system to run on non apple hardware  enforced within the operating system by calls to the apple system management controller  smc  in all apple machines  which verifies the authenticity of the hardware       users of virtualbox can load multiple guest oss under a single host operating system  host os   each guest can be started  paused and stopped independently within its own virtual machine  vm   the user can independently configure each vm and run it under a choice of software based virtualization or hardware assisted virtualization if the underlying host hardware supports this  the host os and guest oss and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility  guest vms can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so       in the absence of hardware assisted virtualization  virtualbox adopts a standard software based virtualization approach  this mode supports    bit guest oss which run in rings   and   of the intel ring architecture     in both cases  virtualbox uses csam and patm to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs  virtualbox also contains a dynamic recompiler  based on qemu to recompile any real mode or protected mode code entirely  e g  bios code  a dos guest  or any operating system startup        using these techniques  virtualbox can achieve a performance comparable to that of vmware         virtualbox supports both intel s vt x and amd s amd v hardware virtualization  making use of these facilities  virtualbox can run each guest vm in its own separate address space  the guest os ring   code runs on the host at ring   in vmx non root mode rather than in ringxa       virtualbox supports some guests  including    bit guests  smp guests and certain proprietary oss  only on hosts with hardware assisted virtualization     the system emulates hard disks in one of three disk image formats     a virtualbox virtual machine can  therefore  use disks previously created in vmware or microsoft virtual pc  as well as its own native format  virtualbox can also connect to iscsi targets and to raw partitions on the host  using either as virtual hard disks  virtualbox emulates ide  piix  and ich  controllers   scsi  sata  ich m controller  and sas controllers to which hard drives can be attached     virtualbox has supported open virtualization format  ovf  since version        april             both iso images and host connected physical devices can be mounted as cd dvd drives  for example  the dvd image of a linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by virtualbox     by default virtualbox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics card that is vesa compatible  the guest additions for windows  linux  solaris  opensolaris  or os   guests include a special video driver that increases video performance and includes additional features  such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the vm window   or desktop composition via virtualized wddm drivers      for an ethernet network adapter  virtualbox virtualizes these network interface cards       the emulated network cards allow most guest oss to run without the need to find and install drivers for networking hardware as they are shipped as part of the guest os  a special paravirtualized network adapter is also available  which improves network performance by eliminating the need to match a specific hardware interface  but requires special driver support in the guest   many distributions of linux ship with this driver included   by default  virtualbox uses nat through which internet software for end users such as firefox or ssh can operate  bridged networking via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured  up to    network adapters can be attached simultaneously  but only four are configurable through the graphical interface     for a sound card  virtualbox virtualizes intel hd audio  intel ich ac    and soundblaster    devices       a usb     controller is emulated so that any usb devices attached to the host can be seen in the guest  the proprietary extension pack adds a usb     controller and  if virtualbox acts as an rdp server  it can also use usb devices on the remote rdp client as if they were connected to the host  although only if the client supports this virtualbox specific extension  oracle provides clients for solaris  linux and sun ray thin clients that can do this  and have promised support for other platforms in future versions        some features require the installation of the closed source  virtualbox extension pack       portable virtualbox is a free and open source software tool that runs any operating system from a usb stick without separate installation
