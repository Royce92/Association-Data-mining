 a video game arcade cabinet  also known as a video arcade machine or video coin op  is the housing within which a video arcade game s hardware resides  most cabinets designed since the mid     s conform to the jamma wiring standard  some include additional connectors for features not included in the standard             note  because arcade cabinets vary according to the games they were built for or contain  they may well not possess all of the parts listed below     the sides of the arcade cabinet are usually decorated with brightly coloured stickers or paint  representing the gameplay of their particular game     there are many types of arcade cabinets  some in fact being custom made for a particular game  however  the most common are the upright  the cocktail or table  and the sit down     upright cabinets are by far the most common in north america  they are usually made of wood and metal  about six feet or two meters tall  with the control panel set perpendicular to the monitor at slightly above waist level  the monitor is housed inside the cabinet  at approximately eye level  the marquee is above it  and often overhangs it     controls are most commonly a joystick for as many players as the game allows  plus action buttons and  player  buttons which serve the same purpose as the start button on console gamepads  trackballs are sometimes used instead of joysticks  especially in games from the early     s  spinners  knobs for turning  also called  paddle controls   are used to control game elements that move strictly horizontally or vertically  such as the paddles in arkanoid and pong  games such as robotron        smash tv and battlezone use double joysticks instead of action buttons  some versions of the original street fighter had pressure sensitive rubber pads instead of buttons     if an upright is housing a driving game  it may have a steering wheel and throttle pedal instead of a joystick and buttons  if the upright is housing a shooting game  it may have light guns attached to the front of the machine  via durable cables  some uprights for shooting games  appear  to have their monitors set a few feet further back than usual   via a mirror mounted at around    degrees above the screen mounted facing upwards  in order to make the game more challenging  other genres of game such as guitar freaks feature controllers resembling musical instruments     upright cabinet shape designs varies from simplest symmetric perpendicular boxes as with star trek to complicated asymmetric forms     games are typically for one or two players  however  games such as gauntlet feature as many as four sets of controls     cocktail cabinets are shaped like low  rectangular tables  with the controls usually set at either of the broad ends  or  not as common  at the narrow ends  and the monitor inside the table  the screen facing upward  two player games housed in cocktails were usually alternant  each player taking turns  the monitor reverses its orientation  game software controlled  for each player  so that everything seems right side up from each perspective  this requires special programming of the cocktail versions of the game  usually set by dip switches   the monitor s orientation is usually in player two s favour only in two player games when it s player two s turn  and in player one s favour all other times  simultaneous    player games that are built as a cocktail include warlords  and others     cocktail cabinet versions were usually released alongside the upright version of the same game  they were relatively common in the     s  especially during the golden age of arcade games  but have since lost popularity  their main advantage over upright cabinets was their smaller size  making them seem less obtrusive  although requiring more floor space more so by having players seated at each end   the top of the table was covered with a piece of tempered glass  making it convenient to set drinks on  hence the name   and they were often seen in bars and pubs     owing to the resemblance of the plastic to hard candy  they are often known as  candy cabinets   by both arcade enthusiasts and industry  they are also generally easier to clean and move than upright cabinets  but usually just as heavy as most have     screens  as opposed to          they are positioned so that the player can sit down on a chair or stool and play for extended periods  snk sold many neo geo mvs cabinets in this configuration  though most arcade games made in japan that only use a joystick and buttons will come in a sit down cabinet variety  in japanese arcades  this type of cabinet is generally more prevalent than the upright kind  and they are usually lined up in uniform looking rows  a variant of this  often referred to as  versus style  cabinets are designed to look like two cabinets facing each other  with two monitors and separate controls allowing two players to fight each other without having to share the same monitor and control area  some newer cabinets can emulate these  versus style  cabinets through networking     most commonly used for games involving gambling  long stints of gaming  or vehicles  such as fighting games  flight simulators  and racing games  these cabinets typically have equipment resembling the controls of a vehicle  though some of them are merely large cabinets with fair features such as a great screen or chairs   driving games may have a bucket seat  foot pedals  a stick shift  and even an ignition  while flight simulators may have a flight yoke or joystick  and motorcycle games handle bars and a seat shaped like a full size bike  often  these cabinets are arranged side by side  to allow players to compete together  some of these cabinets are very elaborate  and include hydraulics which move the player according to the action on screen  sega is among the biggest manufacturers of these kinds of cabinets  while namco released ridge racer full scale  in which the player sat in a full size mazda mx   road car     these are close relatives to deluxe cabinets except the player sits inside the game itself  examples of this can be seen on the killer list of videogames for games such as star wars  sinistar or discs of tron     the mini or cabaret is a squatter version of the upright cabinet  it may also have a smaller monitor  mini cabinets spare bulk and are easier for small children to play than some full size cabinets     countertop or bartop cabinets are usually only large enough to house their monitors and control panels  they are often used for trivia and gambling type games  and are usually found installed on bars or tables in pubs and restaurants  these cabinets often have touchscreen controls instead of traditional push button controls  they are also fairly popular with home use  as they can be placed upon a table or countertop     usually found in japan  these machines have multiple screens interconnected to one system  sometimes with one big screen in the middle  these also often feature the dispension of different type of cards  either a smartcard in order to save stats and progress  or trading cards used in the game     since arcade games are becoming increasingly popular as collectibles  an entire niche industry has sprung up focussed on arcade cabinet restoration  there are many websites  both commercial and hobbyist  and newsgroups devoted to arcade cabinet restoration  they are full of tips and advice on restoring games to mint condition     often game cabinets were used to host a variety of games  often after the cabinet s initial game was removed and replaced with another  the cabinet s side art was painted over  usually black  so that the cabinet wouldn t misrepresent the game contained within  the side art was also painted over to hide damaged or faded artwork     of course  hobbyists prefer cabinets with original artwork in the best possible condition  since machines with good quality art are hard to find  one of the first tasks is stripping any old artwork or paint from the cabinet  this is done with conventional chemical paint strippers or by sanding  preferences vary   normally artwork cannot be preserved that has been painted over and is removed with any covering paint  new paint can be applied in any manner preferred  roller  brush  spray   paint used is often just conventional paint with a finish matching the cabinet s original paint     many games had artwork which was silkscreened directly on the cabinets  others used large decals for the side art  some manufacturers produce replication artwork for popular classic games each varying in quality  this side art can be applied over the new paint after it has dried  these appliques can be very large and must be carefully applied to avoid bubbles or wrinkles from developing  spraying the surface with a slightly soapy water solution allows the artwork to be quickly repositioned if wrinkles or bubbles develop like in window tinting applications     acquiring these pieces is harder than installing them  many hobbyists trade these items via newsgroups or sites such as ebay  the same is true for side art   as with side art  some replication art shops also produce replication artwork for these pieces that is indistinguishable from original  some even surpass the originals in quality  once these pieces are acquired  they usually snap right into place     if the controls are worn and need replacing  if the game is popular  they can be easily obtained  rarer game controls are harder to come by  but some shops stock replacement controls for classic arcade games  some shops manufacture controls that are more robust than originals and fit a variety of machines  installing them takes some experimentation for novices  but are usually not too difficult to place     raster monitors are easier to service than vector monitors  normally  unless the main tube is blown  a raster monitor will provide good display characteristics with perhaps a few minor color adjustments  vector monitors  on the other hand  can be challenging or very costly to service  and some can t be repaired at all  they have dwindled in use since the     s and parts are hard to come by   sometimes they will have to be replaced completely  but even finding replacement monitors is difficult since few  if any  are produced any longer  bare new crts are still available from some suppliers  vector monitors use the same basic tube as a raster  just with different electronics   but as they are bare tubes they usually require the yoke to be removed from the old tube and fitted to the new tube and setting up  which isn t usually a job that can be undertaken by the amateur arcade collector  retrofitting other monitor technologies to emulate vector graphics can also be done     some electronic components are stressed by the hot  cramped conditions inside a cabinet  electrolytic capacitors dry out over time  and in many classic arcade cabinets their service life is nearing the end  if a game has its original raster monitor  it will usually need to be  re capped  that is  some capacitors will need to be replaced so the monitor will deliver a proper image  due to the size of the capacitors and the voltages present inside a video monitor  this can be a dangerous activity and should only be attempted by experienced hobbyists or professionals  if a monitor is broken  a replacement can usually be obtained via coin op distributors or parts suppliers     if a cabinet needs rewiring  some wiring kits are available over the internet  an experienced hobbyist can usually solve most wiring problems through trial and error     many cabinets are converted to be used to host a game other than the original  in these cases  if both games conform to the jamma standard  the process is simple  other conversions can be more difficult  but some manufacturers such as nintendo have produced kits to ease the conversion process  nintendo manufactured kits to convert a cabinet from classic wiring to vs  wiring      some cabinets are constructed entirely by hobbyists to mimic an arcade cabinet using emulators such as mame and a pc to replace the game hardware  these home built cabinets have many of the features of real arcade cabinets  such as a coin box  marquees etc    mame arcade units can combine several arcade controls  such as two types of joysticks and a trackball  in one unit to enable play of many different games      other projects can involve converting a regular single game arcade cabinet into a mame cabinet  eliminating the need for building a cabinet     at least one company manufactures flat pack style cabinet kits made from medium density fibreboard  these remove the need for the hobbyist to cut to shape large panels of the material  but still require assembly  painting and finishing  and fitting out with a game system  controls and display      bespoke arcade cabinets can also be custom built to order  allowing the hobbyist to design the cabinet removing the manual skills necessary for putting a cabinet together      other projects have involved building diy tabletop cabinets and disassembling the casing of game boy advance handhelds thanks to the abundance of arcade classics compilations such as namco museum and other titles  some pre manufactured arcade cabinets were even introduced for using the ipad as a monitor
