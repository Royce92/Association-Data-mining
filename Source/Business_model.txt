 a business model is an  abstract representation of an organization  be it conceptual  textual  and or graphical  of all core interrelated architectural  co operational  and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future  as well as all core products and or services the organization offers  or will offer  based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives    this definition by al debei and avison        indicates that value proposition  value architecture  value finance  and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models      a business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates  delivers  and captures value   in economic  social  cultural or other contexts  the process of business model construction is part of business strategy     in theory and practice  the term business model is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business  including purpose  business process  target customers  offerings  strategies  infrastructure  organizational structures  trading practices  and operational processes and policies  the literature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a business model  a systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity   further extensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create extraordinarily successful growth firms      business models are used to describe and classify businesses  especially in an entrepreneurial setting  but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities for future development  well known business models can operate as  recipes  for creative managers   business models are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting             over the years  business models have become much more sophisticated  the bait and hook business model  also referred to as the  razor and blades business model  or the  tied products business model   was introduced in the early   th century  this involves offering a basic product at a very low cost  often at a loss  the  bait    then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services  the  hook    examples include  razor  bait  and blades  hook   cell phones  bait  and air time  hook   computer printers  bait  and ink cartridge refills  hook   and cameras  bait  and prints  hook   a variant of this model is adobe  a software developer that gives away its document reader free of charge but charges several hundred dollars for its document writer     in the     s  new business models came from mcdonald s restaurants and toyota  in the     s  the innovators were wal mart and hypermarkets  the     s saw new business models from fedex and toys r us  the     s from blockbuster  home depot  intel  and dell computer  the     s from southwest airlines  netflix  ebay  amazon com  and starbucks     today  the type of business models might depend on how technology is used  for example  entrepreneurs on the internet have also created entirely new models that depend entirely on existing or emergent technology  using technology  businesses can reach a large number of customers with minimal costs     design logic views the business model as an outcome of creating new organizational structures or changing existing structures to pursue a new opportunity  gerry george and adam bock        conducted a comprehensive literature review and surveyed managers to understand how they perceived the components of a business model  in that analysis  these authors show that there is a design logic behind how entrepreneurs and managers perceive and explain their business model  in further extensions to the design logic  george and bock        use case studies and the ibm survey data on business models in large companies to describe how ceos and entrepreneurs create narratives or stories in a coherent manner to move the business from one opportunity to another  they also show that when the narrative is incoherent or the components of the story are misaligned that these businesses tend to fail  they recommend ways in which the entrepreneur or ceo can create strong narratives for change     studying collaborative research and the accessing of external sources of technology  hummel et al         found that in deciding on business partners  it is important to make sure that both parties  business models are complementary   for example  they found that it was important to identify the value drivers of potential partners by analyzing their business models  and that it is beneficial to find partner firms that understand key aspects of our own firm s business model      from about       some research and experimentation has theorized about a so called  liquid business model         al debei and avison        v  bm framework   four main dimensions encapsulating sixteen elements  value proposition  value architecture  value network  and value finance     sangeet paul choudary        distinguishes between two broad families of business models in an article in wired magazine    choudary  of platform thinking    contrasts pipes  linear business models  with platforms  networked business models   in the case of pipes  firms create stuff  push them out and sell them to customers  value is produced upstream and consumed downstream  there is a linear flow  much like water flowing through a pipe  unlike pipes  platforms do not just create and push stuff out  they allow users to create and consume value     in an op ed on marketwatch    choudary  van alstyne and parker further explain how business models are moving from pipes to platforms  leading to disruption of entire industries     in an earlier article in harvard business review    sangeet paul choudary elaborates on the three elements of a successful platform business model  the toolbox creates connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform  this infrastructure enables interactions between participants  the magnet creates pull that attracts participants to the platform  for transaction platforms  both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass  the matchmaker fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers  data is at the heart of successful matchmaking  and distinguishes platforms from other business models     chen        stated that the business model in the twenty first century has to take into account the capabilities of web      such as collective intelligence  network effects  user generated content  and the possibility of self improving systems  he suggested that the service industry such as the airline  traffic  transportation  hotel  restaurant  information and communications technology and online gaming industries will be able to benefit in adopting business models that take into account the characteristics of web      he also emphasized that business model     has to take into account not just the technology effect of web     but also the networking effect  he gave the example of the success story of amazon in making huge revenues each year by developing a full blown open platform that supports a large and thriving community of companies that re use amazon s on demand commerce services   need quotation to verify    malone et al    at mit found that some business models  as defined by them  indeed performed better than others in a dataset consisting of the largest u s  firms  in the period      through       while they did not prove whether the existence of a business model mattered     in the context of the software cluster  which is funded by the german federal ministry of education and research  a business model wizard for software companies has been developed  it supports the design and analysis of software business models  the tool s underlying concept and data were published in various scientific publications       the concept of a business model has been incorporated into certain accounting standards  for example  the international accounting standards board  iasb  utilizes an  entity s business model for managing the financial assets  as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its financial instruments accounting standard  ifrs            in their      proposal for accounting for financial instruments  the financial accounting standards board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments    the concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under international financial reporting standards with      amendments to ias    addressing deferred taxes related to investment property           both iasb and fasb have proposed using the concept of business model in the context of reporting a lessor s lease income and lease expense within their joint project on accounting for leases            the concept has also been proposed as an approach for determining the measurement and classification when accounting for insurance contracts      as a result of the increasing prominence the concept of business model has received in the context of financial reporting  the european financial reporting advisory group  efrag   which advises the european union on endorsement of financial reporting standards  commenced a project on the  role of the business model in financial reporting  in            business model design refers to the activity of designing a company s business model  it is part of the business development and business strategy process and involves design methods     al debei and avison        define a business model as an abstract representation of an organization  be it conceptual  textual  and or graphical  of all core interrelated architectural  co operational  and financial arrangements designed and developed by an organization presently and in the future  as well all core products and or services the organization offers  or will offer  based on these arrangements that are needed to achieve its strategic goals and objectives   this definition indicates that value proposition  value architecture  value finance  and value network articulate the primary constructs or dimensions of business models      al debei and avison        consider value finance as one of the main dimensions of bm which depicts information related to costing  pricing methods  and revenue structure  stewart and zhao        defined the business model as   a statement of how a firm will make money and sustain its profit stream over time          osterwalder et al         consider the business model as the blueprint of how a company does business    slywotzky        regards the business model as   the totality of how a company selects its customers  defines and differentiates it offerings  defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource  configures its resources  goes to market  creates utility for customers and captures profits          mayo and brown        considered the business model as   the design of key interdependent systems that create and sustain a competitive business          zott and amit        consider business model design from the perspectives of design themes and design content  design themes refer to the system s dominant value creation drivers and design content examines in greater detail the activities to be performed  the linking and sequencing of the activities and who will perform the activities       developing a framework for business model development with an emphasis on design themes  lim        proposed the environment strategy structure operations  esso  business model development which takes into consideration the alignment of the organization s strategy with the organization s structure  operations  and the environmental factors in achieving competitive advantage in varying combination of cost  quality  time  flexibility  innovation and affective       business model design includes the modeling and description of a company s     business model design is distinct from business modeling  the former refers to defining the business logic of a company at the strategic level  whereas the latter refers to business process design at the operational level     a business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a company s business model     daas et al         developed a decision support system  dss  for business model design  in their study a decision support system  dss  is developed to help saas in this process  based on a design approach consisting of a design process that is guided by various design methods       in the early history of business models it was very typical to define business model types such as bricks and mortar or e broker  however  these types usually describe only one aspect of the business  most often revenue model   therefore  more recent literature on business models concentrates on describing business model as a whole instead of one most visible aspects     the following examples provide an overview for various business model types that have been in discussion since the invention of term business model     other examples of business models are     technology centric communities have defined  frameworks  for business modeling  these frameworks attempt to define a rigorous approach to defining business value streams  it is not clear  however  to what extent such frameworks are actually important for business planning  business model frameworks represent the core aspect of any company  they involve  the totality of how a company selects its customers defines and differentiates its offerings  defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource  configures its resource  goes to market  creates utility for customers  and captures profits     a business framework involves internal factors  market analysis  products services promotion  development of trust  social influence and knowledge sharing  and external factors  competitors and technological aspects     a state of the art review on business model frameworks can be found in krumeich et al            in the following some frameworks are introduced     the process of business model design is part of business strategy  the implementation of a company s business model into organisational structures  e g  organigrams  workflows  human resources  and systems  e g  information technology architecture  production lines  is part of a company s business operations     it is important to understand that the implementation of business model is enabled by business operations  which refers to the firms process level activities  capabilities  functions and infrastructure  e g   business processs and business process modeling   at the operational level  whereas business model design and innovation refer to defining the business logic of a firm  or a network of firms  at the strategic level  hence  an operationally viable and feasible business model requires lateral alignment with the underlining business operations       the brand is a consequence of and has a symbiotic relationship with the business model since the business model determines the brand promise and the brand equity becomes a feature of the model  managing this is a task of integrated marketing     the standard terminology and examples of business models do not apply to most nonprofit organizations  since their sources of income are generally not the same as the beneficiaries  the term funding model is generally used instead
