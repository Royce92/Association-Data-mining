 platform as a service  paas  is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop  run and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app     paas can be delivered in two ways  as a public cloud service from a provider  where the consumer controls software deployment and configuration settings  and the provider provides the networks  servers  storage and other services to host the consumer s application  or as software installed in private data centers or public infrastructure as a service and managed by internal it departments               the idea of paas was pioneered on the web by amazon web services  aws  and salesforce com  in april       google launched app engine  with a free trial version limited to        developers   this was said to have  turned the internet cloud computing space into a fully fledged industry virtually overnight       the original intent of paas was to simplify the code writing process for developers  with the infrastructure and operations handled by the paas provider  originally  all paases were in the public cloud  because many companies did not want to have everything in the public cloud  private and hybrid paas options  managed by internal it departments  were created      paas provides an environment for developers and companies to create  host and deploy applications  saving developers from the complexities of the infrastructure side  setting up  configuring and managing elements such as servers and databases   paas can improve the speed of developing an app  and allow the consumer to focus on the application itself  with paas  the consumer manages applications and data  while the provider  in public paas  or it department  in private paas  manages runtime  middleware  operating system  virtualization  servers  storage and networking    development tools provided by the vendor are customized according to the needs of the user    the user can choose to maintain the software  or have the vendor maintain it      paas offerings may also include facilities for application design  application development  testing and deployment  as well as services such as team collaboration  web service integration  and marshalling  database integration  security  scalability  storage  persistence  state management  application versioning  application instrumentation  and developer community facilitation  besides the service engineering aspects  paas offerings include mechanisms for service management  such as monitoring  workflow management  discovery and reservation         the advantages to paas are primarily that it allows for higher level programming with dramatically reduced complexity  the overall development of the application can be more effective  as it has built in infrastructure  and maintenance and enhancement of the application is easier   it can also be useful in situations where multiple developers are working on a single project involving parties who are not located nearby      the primary disadvantage would be the possibility of being locked in to a certain platform  however  most paases are relatively lock in free   other possible disadvantages  according to forbes  include the relative youth of the cloud service model  the lack of support for  net by many providers  and that the value and definition of paas has been at times misunderstood by those working in it      there are several types of paas  including public  private and hybrid   paas was originally intended as an application solution in the public cloud  before expanding to include private and hybrid options      public paas is derived from software as a service  saas    and is situated in cloud computing between saas and infrastructure as a service  iaas    saas is software that is hosted in the cloud  so that it doesn t take up hard drive or server space  iaas provides virtual storage from a provider with adjustable scalability   with iaas  the user still has to manage the server  whereas with paas the server management is done by the provider       a private paas can typically be downloaded and installed either on a company s on premises infrastructure  or in a public cloud  once the software is installed on one or more machines  the private paas arranges the application and database components into a single hosting platform    private paas vendors include apprenda  which started out on the microsoft  net platform before rolling out a java paas  red hat s openshift and pivotal cloud foundry    apprenda and microsoft are considered to be two of the only paases that provide superior  net support      initiated in       mobile paas  mpaas  provides development capabilities for mobile app designers and developers    the yankee group identified mpaas as one of its themes for       naming a number of providers including kinvey  cloudmine  anypresence  feedhenry  fatfractal and point io         open paas does not include hosting  but rather it provides open source software allowing a paas provider to run applications in an open source environment  for example  appscale allows a user to deploy some applications written for google app engine to their own servers  providing datastore access from a standard sql or nosql database  some open platforms let the developer use any programming language  database  operating system or server to deploy their applications         in       forrester research defined enterprise public cloud platforms for rapid developers as an emerging trend  naming a number of provides including outsystems  mendix  salesforce com  and acquia       paas is found on the following types of systems     there are various types of paas providers  all offer application hosting and a deployment environment  along with various integrated services  services offer varying levels of scalability and maintenance   developers can write an application and upload it to a paas that supports their software language of choice  and the application runs on that paas       public paas providers and private paas vendors include
