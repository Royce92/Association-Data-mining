 google drive is a file storage and synchronization service created and managed by google    it allows users to store documents in the cloud  share files  and edit documents with collaborators  google drive encompasses google docs  sheets and slides  an office suite that permits collaborative editing of documents  spreadsheets  presentations  drawings  forms  and more  files shared publicly on google drive can be searched with web search engines     google drive was launched on april            and had     million monthly active users as of october                   for google drive to synchronize files between the user s computer and google drive storage  the google drive  client  software must be running on the user s computer  the client communicates with google drive to cause updates on one side to be propagated to the other so they both normally contain the same data     google drive client software is available for the following devices  pcs running windows xp  windows vista  windows    and windows   with ntfs partitions  or mac os x       snow leopard  or higher  android smartphones and tablets with android      eclair  or higher  iphones and ipads with ios     or higher   newest iterations of google drive client software do not appear to work properly under snow leopard  os        returning a bad gpu message and not allowing the user to access the minibar icon  replacing the newer client with an older version appears to fix the problem although automatic updates may mean its recurrence     even though there is no official client software for linux  google drive can be mounted directly to a linux file system using gdrivefs or google drive ocamlfuse  which are fuse based file systems backed by google drive     google drive can also be accessed through linux via open source projects such as grive    google developer burcu dogan has created an easy to use client called drive  google indicated in april      that work on linux client software was underway    but there was no news on this as of november     update       sundar pichai of google said that the google drive online storage service would be tightly integrated with chrome os version          google drive can be accessed offline on the google chrome browser via a chrome app  which can be installed from the chrome web store  documents  spreadsheets  presentations and drawings can also be viewed and edited offline through standalone chrome apps  the google drive app for android and ios supports offline viewing of all file types  offline editing for documents and spreadsheets is supported through standalone mobile apps       google offers all users an initial    gb of online storage space  that is shared across three of its most used services  google drive  gmail  and google  photos    aka picasa web albums     users can upgrade their free    gb account through a paid monthly subscription plan to get additional storage    documents using google docs native formats  including  gdoc   gslides  and  gsheet  do not count towards this quota  in google  photos  photos of resolution less than      x      pixels and videos shorter than    minutes also do not count towards this quota    uploaded files in microsoft office and opendocument formats  with possible formatting changes  can be converted to google s proprietary formats  and thus can be stored without counting against the storage quota     as of    march     update  storage plans offered by google  charged exclusively in us dollar so that any customer outside the us will need to pay exchange charges  are as follows       google offers    gb of drive storage for all google apps users  and unlimited storage for those using google drive for work or google drive for education  as long as there are at least   members  associations with less than   members get   tb per user    varying levels of free additional storage is offered on the purchase of select android devices from motorola and htc  kensington devices   and chromebooks     by default  storage purchases are automatically set to renew at the end of the subscription  if the auto renewal fails  a   day grace period is offered for users to update their payment information  when the storage plan expires or is cancelled  storage limit is set back to the free level  users can still access all their content  but will not be able to add anything new over the storage limit    at any point during the subscription  users can upgrade to a larger storage plan  but can downgrade to a smaller plan only if they are under the    gb free limit    this implies that instead of technically changing the plan  google first cancels the existing plan and then applies the newer one     google docs initially provided   gb of storage for free  on april           google drive was introduced with a free storage of   gb  other aspects of the service were changed at the same time  free storage for gmail was increased from    gb to    gb  storage plans were revised  prices were increased and were charged on a monthly basis rather than on a yearly basis  as per the revised pricing        per month was charged for    gb or       for     gb       originally  gmail  google docs and picasa had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storage  between april      and may       google drive and google  photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage  whereas gmail had a separate    gb storage limit  which increased to    gb on the purchase of any storage plan  as of june       both free and purchased storage is shared between all the three services       in september       google announced that it was cutting the existing free storage from all paid users  accounts  so that a user buying a     gb plan will get     gb of total storage instead of it adding up to the free storage       on may           google announced the overall merge of storage across gmail  google drive and google  photos allowing users    gb of unified free storage between the services         on march           the storage plans were revised again and prices were drastically reduced  by      to just       per month for     gb or       for   tb  this was much cheaper than competitors dropbox and onedrive offered at that time      the    gb and     gb plans were discontinued and the   tb    tb    tb and    tb plans were replaced with    tb     tb and    tb  users were automatically upgraded to the new pricing scheme     in most cases during these changes  users can continue with their existing plans as long as they keep their accounts active  and do not make any adjustments to the plan  however  if the account lapses or if the credit card is declined  users are asked to choose from the plans being offered currently       google drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder  is by default  its owner  the owner has the ability to regulate the public visibility of the file or folder  ownership is transferable  files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a google account  using their  gmail com email addresses  sharing files with users not having a google account requires making them accessible to  anybody with the link   this generates a secret url for the file  which may be shared via email  blogs  etc  files and folders can also be made  public on the web   which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone  the owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions  the three access levels offered are  can edit    can comment  and  can view   users with editing access can invite others to edit     there are a number of external web applications   apps   that work with google drive  these apps are available from the chrome web store and are compatible with all supported browsers  to use an app  users are required to sign in into chrome web store and add the app  some of these apps are first party  such as google docs  sheets and slides  drive apps operate on the online files  and can be used to view  edit and create files in various formats  edit images and videos  fax and sign documents  manage projects  create flowcharts  etc  drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them  some of these apps also work offline  although only on google chrome and chrome os        all of the third party apps are free to install  however  some have fees associated with continued usage or access to additional features  most drive apps have the permission to access users  files outside of google drive  saving data from a third party app to google drive requires authorization the first time    the google drive sdk works together with the google drive ui and the chrome web store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into google drive     in february       the  create  menu in google drive was revamped to include third party apps  thus effectively granting them the same status as google s own apps    on march           google released an api for google drive that enables third party developers to build collaborative apps that support real time editing       the google drive viewer on the web allows one to view the following file formats       files in other formats can also be handled through third party apps that work with google drive  available from the chrome web store    the google drive apps for android and ios can use other apps installed on the device to open unsupported file types         files uploaded  but not converted to google docs format  may be up to   tb in size not in citation given created or uploaded files larger than   tb cannot be viewed within google drive    embedded images must not exceed   mb each       there are also limits  specific to file type  listed below     search results can be narrowed by file type  ownership  visibility  and the open with app  google drive supports boolean operators       using google goggles and optical character recognition  ocr  technology  users can search for images by describing or naming what is in them  for example  a search for  mountain  returns all the photos of mountains as well as any text documents about mountains  text in the first     pages of text documents and text based pdfs  and in the first    pages of image based pdfs can be searched    text in images and pdfs can be extracted using ocr     on    june       google announced a number of updates to google drive  which included making the service more accessible to visually impaired users  this included improved keyboard accessibility  support for zooming and high contrast mode  and better compatibility with screen readers       additionally  the google drive web interface supports keyboard shortcuts     google offers an extension for google chrome save to google drive that allows users to save web content to google drive through a browser action or through the context menu  while documents and images can be saved directly  webpages can be saved in the form of a screenshot  as an image of the visible part of the page or the entire page   or as a raw html  mhtml  or google docs file  users need to be signed in to chrome to use the extension       google drive for work is a premium version of google apps for work announced at the google i o conference on    june      and was made available immediately  the service features unlimited storage  advanced file audit reporting and ediscovery services  along with what google calls  new fine grained controls that let admins customize the drive experience  such as which employees can install the desktop sync client   users can upload files as large as   tb  for companies with less than   users  the storage limit is fixed to   tb per user  a press release posted on google s official enterprise blog assured businesses that google will encrypt data stored on its servers  as well as information being transmitted to or from them  google will deliver round the clock support to premium users and has guaranteed       uptime for its servers       google drive for education was announced on september           it was made available for free to all google apps for education users  it includes unlimited storage and support for individual files up to  tb in size       google docs  google sheets and google slides constitute a free  web based office suite offered by google and integrated with google drive  it allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating in real time with other users  since october       docs  sheets and slides respectively refer to the word processing  spreadsheet and presentation programs within the suite  the three apps are available as web applications  as chrome apps that work offline  and as mobile apps for android and ios  the apps are compatible with microsoft office file formats  the suite also consists of google forms  google drawings and google tables  beta   while forms and tables are only available as web applications  drawings is also available as a chrome app  google docs is tightly integrated with google drive  all files created with the apps are by default saved to google drive     prior to the launch of google drive  google docs was also an online file storage service  but since the launch of google drive in april       all files created using google docs are saved to google drive and the google docs  url  docs google com  redirects to google drive note   the free storage space was increased from   gb to   gb as part of this transition       google docs originated from two separate products  writely and google spreadsheets  writely was a web based word processor created by the software company upstartle and launched in august         upstartle was acquired by google on march            google spreadsheets was first launched as a limited test on google labs on june          following the acquisition of  web technologies    a presentation program was added to the suite on september          following the acquisition of tonic systems on april               google docs was made available to google apps users in february      and the service was taken out of beta in september          in october       following the launch of google drive  google documents  spreadsheets and presentations were renamed google docs  sheets and slides respectively    standalone mobile apps for the three products were announced in april            offline support on chrome and chrome os was first introduced for documents in june        and was subsequently extended to presentations in january        and to spreadsheets in december            google docs is officially supported on the two most recent versions of the firefox  internet explorer       safari and chrome browsers running on microsoft windows  apple os x  linux and chrome os operating systems       google has one unified set of terms of service and privacy policy for all its products  according to cnet  unlike competing services dropbox and onedrive  google has broad rights to reproduce  use  and create derivative works from content stored on the google drive  via a license from its users  this license is perpetual even after the user removes the material  although the user retains intellectual property rights  the user licenses google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that google provides to the user  and to promote the service    google s broad license to uploaded files also allows it to make usability improvements  such as creating modified versions of uploaded content which are more suitable for various uses  for example  google might transcode an uploaded video into formats more suitable for viewing on a handheld computer or a certain browser than the original     a report from the verge  however  finds that google s terms are quite comparable to those of its competitors  and slightly better in some cases       on november           google announced that google drive had     million active users  a figure that the company was releasing for the first time       on june          at the google i o conference  sundar pichai announced that google drive now had     million monthly active users  and that it was being used by     of the fortune     companies as well as by    of the top universities       on october          at its atmosphere live event  it was announced the google drive had     million monthly active users  the next web noted that this meant an increase of    million users in just one quarter      in a cloud environment  data security issues and national interests mean that online document storage and processing can be unsuitable for use by governments or commercial organizations  especially where sensitive or confidential data is being stored  edited or shared on systems and infrastructure that are outsourced  e g  by senior us government officials to google  and shared with many other organizations  individuals  or users  e g  the internet          some of the issues that have to be considered to see if google drive is  enterprise ready  include     a google account  which is used for signing in to google drive  provides optional free two factor authentication for greater account security    if it is enabled  then to log in  users have to provide a short random code sequence sent to their phones via sms or generated by the google authenticator app on android or ios      google has also switched to using secure sockets layer communication  https  by default  preventing common man in the middle attacks        in addition  third party google drive plugins exist which enable at rest encryption of data stored on drive  adding a further layer of security       the google drive app on android and ios supported editing of documents and spreadsheets until april       when the capability was moved to the newly released standalone apps for docs  sheets and slides  the google drive app on android allows users to take a photo of a document  sign  or other text and use optical character recognition to convert to text that can be edited      the safari browser on iphone allows users to view documents  spreadsheets  and presentation and to edit and create google docs documents and spreadsheets    most other mobile devices can also view and edit google docs documents and spreadsheets using a mobile browser    pdf files can be viewed but not edited     on october           google drive for android was updated with a material design facelift  improved search  the ability to add a custom message while sharing a file  and a new pdf viewer
