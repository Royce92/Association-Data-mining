character cell based color graphics and open architecture  while early apple ii models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices  they were superseded by the introduction of a  xa    xa inch floppy disk drive and interface called the disk ii    the apple ii was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first  killer app  of the business world  visicalc  a spreadsheet program    visicalc created a business market for the apple ii and gave home users an additional reason to buy an apple ii  compatibility with the office    before visicalc  apple had been a distant third place competitor to commodore and tandy         by the end of the     s  apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line  the company introduced the apple iii in may      in an attempt to

   per share    generating more capital than any ipo since ford motor company in      and instantly creating more millionaires  about      than any company in history       apple began working on the apple lisa in       in       jobs was pushed from the lisa team due to infighting  jobs took over jef raskin s low cost computer project  the macintosh  a race broke out between the lisa team and the macintosh team over which product would ship first  lisa won the race in      and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a gui  but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles       in       apple launched the macintosh  it was the first personal computer to be sold without a programming language at all    its debut was announced by the now famous      million television commercial         it was directed by ridley scott and first aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january             the commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for apple s success   and a  masterpiece          the macintosh initially sold well  but follow up sales were not strong   due to its high price and limited range of software titles  the machine s fortunes changed with the introduction of the laserwriter  the first postscript laser printer to be sold at a reasonable price  and pagemaker  an early desktop publishing package  it has been suggested that the combination of these three products was responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market    the macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities  which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive macintosh gui     in      a power struggle developed between jobs and ceo john sculley  who had been hired two years earlier    the apple board of directors instructed sculley to  contain  jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products  rather than submit to sculley s direction  jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at apple  sculley found out that jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called a board meeting at which apple s board of directors sided with sculley and removed jobs from his managerial duties    jobs resigned from apple and founded next inc  the same year       the macintosh portable was introduced in      and was

year  apple introduced system    a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities  it remained the architectural basis for mac os until       the success of the powerbook and other products brought increasing revenue    for some time  apple was doing incredibly well  introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process  the magazine macaddict named the period between      and      as the  first golden age  of the macintosh citation needed    apple believed the apple ii series was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low end macintosh    in       apple released the macintosh lc  which featured a single expansion slot for the apple iie card to help migrate apple ii users to the macintosh platform    apple stopped selling the apple iie in       following the success of the macintosh lc  apple introduced the centris line  a low end quadra  and the ill fated performa line  consumers ended up confused because they did not understand the difference between models    apple experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the    s  including digital cameras  portable cd audio players  speakers  video consoles  and tv appliances  enormous resources were also invested in the problem plagued newton division based on john sculley s unrealistic market forecasts citation needed ultimately  none of these products helped and apple s market share and stock prices continued to slide citation needed    microsoft continued to gain market share with windows by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers while apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience    apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response citation needed instead  they sued microsoft for using a graphical user interface similar to the apple lisa in apple computer  inc  v  microsoft corporation    the lawsuit dragged on for years before it was finally dismissed  at the same time  a series of major product flops and missed deadlines sullied apple s reputation and sculley was

only online portal which they called eworld  which was developed in collaboration with america online and designed as a mac friendly alternative to other online services such as compuserve  the macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware  in addition  apple was facing competition from os   and unix vendors such as sun microsystems  the macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware       in       apple allied with ibm and motorola in the aim alliance with the goal of creating a new computing platform  the powerpc reference platform   which would use ibm and motorola hardware coupled with apple software  the aim alliance hoped that prep s performance and apple s software would leave the pc far behind and thus counter microsoft  the same year  apple introduced the power macintosh  the first of many apple computers to use motorola s powerpc processor       in       michael spindler was replaced by gil amelio as ceo  gil amelio made many changes at apple  including extensive layoffs

security of unix with the ease of use afforded by an overhauled user interface  to aid users in migrating from mac os    the new operating system allowed the use of os   applications within mac os x

power settings accordingly  apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iphone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used        in a march      interview  apple designer jonathan ive used the iphone as an example of apple s ethos of creating high quality  life changing products  he explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them     we don t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons     quite the reverse  the body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium     the whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured  except for the apple logo  the chamfers smoothed off edges are cut with diamond tipped cutters  the cutters don t usually last very long  so we had to figure out a way of mass manufacturing long lasting ones  the camera cover is sapphire crystal  look at the details around the sim card slot  it s extraordinary       at the

fruitarian diet  jobs thought the name  apple  was  fun  spirited and not intimidating         apple s first logo  designed by ron wayne  depicts sir isaac newton sitting under an apple tree  it was almost immediately replaced by rob janoff s  rainbow apple   the now familiar rainbow colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it  janoff presented jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the  bitten  logo  and jobs immediately took a liking to it  however  jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company        the logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry     the colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible  and to represent the fact the apple ii could generate graphics in color     this logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to alan turing  with the bite mark a reference to his method of suicide        both janoff and apple deny any homage to turing in the design of the logo           on august              the year following the introduction of the imac g    apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation  an aqua themed version of the monochrome logo was used from      to       and a glass themed version was used from      to      citation needed    steve jobs and steve wozniak were beatles fans        but apple inc  had name and logo trademark issues with apple corps ltd   a multimedia company started by the beatles in       this resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies  these issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in      citation needed    apple s first slogan   byte into an apple   was coined in the late     s     from      to       the slogan  think different  was used in advertising campaigns  and is still closely associated with apple     apple also has slogans for specific product linesxa   for example   ithink  therefore imac  was used in      to promote the imac     and  say hello to iphone  has been used in iphone advertisements      hello  was also used to introduce the original macintosh  newton  imac   hello  again     and ipod        from the introduction of the macintosh in      with the      super bowl commercial to the more modern  get a mac  adverts  apple has been recognized in for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products  however  claims made by later campaigns were criticized  particularly the      power mac ads           apple s product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye popping graphics and catchy tunes     musicians who benefited from an improved profile as a result of their songs being included on apple commercials include canadian singer feist with the song        and yael na m with the song  new soul          the scenes i witnessed at the opening of the new apple store in london s covent garden were more like an evangelical prayer meeting than a chance to buy a phone or a laptop      apple s high level of brand loyalty is considered unusual for any product  apple evangelists were actively engaged by the company at one time  but this was after the phenomenon had already been firmly established  apple evangelist guy kawasaki has called the brand fanaticism  something that was stumbled upon      while ive explained in      that  people have an incredibly personal relationship  with apple s products    apple store openings can draw crowds of thousands  with some waiting

usually more affluent and better educated than other pc company consumers  the research indicated that this correlation could stem from the fact that on average apple inc  products were more expensive than other pc products           in response to a query about the devotion of loyal apple consumers  jonathan ive responded     what people are responding to is much bigger than the object  they are responding to something rare a group of people who do more than simply make something work  they make the very best products they possibly can  it s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness       the apple website home page has been used to commemorate  or pay tribute to  milestones and events outside of apple s product offerings     apple inc  s world corporate headquarters

traditional notions of corporate culture  jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after apple became a fortune     company  by the time of the        television commercial  apple s informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors     according to a      report in fortune  this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation        as the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives  it has arguably lost some of its original character  nonetheless  it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers  particularly after jobs returned to the company  numerous apple employees have stated that projects without jobs s involvement often take longer than projects with it     to recognize the best of its employees  apple created the apple fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing while at the company  the apple fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including bill atkinson     steve capps     rod holt     alan kay        guy kawasaki        al alcorn     don norman     rich page     and steve wozniak        at apple  employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise  jobs saw this as a means of having  best in class  employees in every role  for instance  ron johnson senior vice president of retail operations until november         was responsible for site selection  in store service  and store layout  yet had no control of the inventory in his stores  this was done by cook  who had a background in supply chain management         apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability  each project has a  directly responsible individual   or  dri  in apple jargon     as an example  when ios senior vice president scott forstall refused to sign apple s official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned maps app  he was forced to resign     unlike other major u s  companies apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other ceos like country club fees or private use of company aircraft  the company typically grants stock options to executives every other year        in      apple retained eight inc  as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the apple retail stores  tim kobe of eight inc  prepared an  apple retail  white paper for jobs  outlining the ability of separate apple retail stores to directly drive the apple brand experience kobe used their recently completed work with the north face and nike as a basis for the white paper citation needed the first two apple stores opened on may          in tysons corner  virginia  and glendale  california  more than       people visited apple s first two stores in the opening weekend  spending a total of us             as of june       apple maintains     retail stores in fourteen countries        in addition to apple products  the stores sell third party products like software titles  digital cameras  camcorders and handheld organizers        a media article published in july      provided details about apple s  at home apple advisors  customer support program that serves as the corporation s call center  the advisors are employed within the u s  and work remotely after undergoing a four week training program and testing period  the advisors earn between us   and     per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support        the company s manufacturing  procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large  profit sapping inventories  in       apple s profit margins were    percent  compared with between    and    percent for most other hardware companies  cook s catchphrase to describe his focus on the company s operational arm is   nobody wants to buy sour milk            during the mac s early history apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware  instead creating their own     this trend was largely reversed in the late     s  beginning with apple s adoption of the pci bus in the                power macs  apple has since adopted usb  agp  hypertransport  wi fi  and other industry standards in its computers  firewire is an apple originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as ieee             the company advertised its products as being made in america until the late     s  however  as a result of outsourcing initiatives in the     s  almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad  according to a report by the new york times  apple insiders  believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility  diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their american counterparts that  made in the u s a   is no longer a viable option for most apple products         in       the mail on sunday reported on the working conditions of the chinese factories where contract manufacturers foxconn and inventec produced the ipod     the article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the ipod and other items had over         workers living and working within it  employees regularly worked more than    hours per week and made around      per month  a little over half of the workers  earnings

working conditions     in       apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding worker s rights  slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply  yearly progress reports have been published since          in       apple admitted that its suppliers  child labor practices in china had worsened        the foxconn suicides occurred between january and november       when       foxconn  chinese       employees attempted suicide  resulting in    deaths the company was the world s largest contract electronics manufacturer  for clients including apple  at the time           the suicides drew media attention  and employment practices at foxconn were investigated by apple     apple issued a public statement about the suicides  and company spokesperson steven dowling said     apple is saddened and upset by the recent suicides at foxconn     a team from apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made        the statement was released after the results from the company s probe into its suppliers  labor practices were published in early       foxconn was not specifically named in the report  but apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws  including apple s own rules  and some child labor existed in a number of factories     apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides        also in       workers in china planned to sue iphone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean lcd screens  one worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses     after a high suicide rate in a foxconn facility in china making ipads and iphones  albeit a lower rate than that of china as a whole     workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves     workers in factories producing apple products have also been exposed to n hexane  a neurotoxin that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products              in       china labor watch said it found violations of the law and of apple s working condition pledges at facilities operated by pegatron  these violations included discrimination against ethnic minorities and women  withholding of employee pay  excessive work hours  poor living conditions  health and safety problems and pollution        a      bbc investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted  despite apple s promise to reform factory practice after the      foxconn suicides  the pegatron factory was once again the subject of review  as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees  while the bbc maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since       apple publicly disagreed with the bbc and stated   we are aware of no other company doing as much as apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions         in december       the institute for global labour and human rights published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the        workers at a zhen ding technology factory in shenzhen  china  which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for apple s iphone and ipad  according to the report  workers are pressured into    hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks  they are also made to reside in  primitive  dark and filthy dorms  where they sleep  on plywood  with six to ten workers in each crowded room   omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers           in      class action against several silicon valley companies  including apple  was filed for alleged  no cold call  agreements which restrained the recruitment of high tech employees        following a greenpeace protest  apple released a statement on april          committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to      clean energy        by      apple was using      renewable energy to power their data centers  overall      of the
