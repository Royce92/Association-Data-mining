 the net capacity factor of a power plant is the ratio of its actual output over a period of time  to its potential output if it were possible for it to operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time  to calculate the capacity factor  take the total amount of energy the plant produced during a period of time and divide by the amount of energy the plant would have produced at full capacity  capacity factors vary greatly depending on the type of fuel that is used and the design of the plant  the capacity factor should not be confused with the availability factor  capacity credit  firm capacity  or with efficiency             a base load power plant with a capacity of       megawatts  mw  might produce         megawatt hours  mw h  in a    day month  the number of megawatt hours that would have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity can be determined by multiplying the plant s maximum capacity by the number of hours in the time period       xa mw  xa   xa days  xa   xa hours day is        xa mw h  the capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual output with the maximum possible output  in this case  the capacity factor is                the burton wold wind farm consists of ten enercon e   e  wind turbines  xa  xa mw nameplate capacity for a total installed capacity of   xa mw   in      the wind farm generated       xa mw h of electricity   note      was a leap year   the capacity factor for this wind farm in      was just under         as of april       the danish wind farm horns rev     the world s largest when it was inaugurated in september       comprising    siemens swt        wind turbines each of     mw  with a nominal total capacity of     mw  has the best capacity factor of any offshore wind farm at       having produced over     years       gw h   the record for an onshore wind farm is held by burradale  which reached an annual capacity factor of       for           according to   the average capacity factor for wind farms in      was         as of       three gorges dam is the largest power generating station in the world by nameplate capacity  in       not yet

a capacity factor of just under         hoover dam has a nameplate capacity of      mw  and an annual generation averaging    xa tw h    the annual generation has varied between a high of       xa tw h in       and a low of      xa tw h in         taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of     there are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than       the first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants  base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output  geothermal plants  nuclear plants  coal fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants     the second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than      is that output is curtailed because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants  peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day  their electricity is relatively expensive  it is uneconomical  even wasteful  to make a peaking power plant as efficient as a base load plant because they do not operate enough to pay for the extra equipment cost  and perhaps not enough to offset the embodied energy of the additional components     a third reason is a variation on the second  the operators of a hydroelectric dam may uprate its nameplate capacity by adding more generator units  since the supply of fuel  i e  water  remains unchanged  the uprated dam obtains a higher peak output in exchange for a lower capacity factor  because hydro plants are highly dispatchable  they are able to act as load following power plants  having a higher peak capacity allows a dam s operators to sell more of the annual output of electricity during the hours of highest electricity demand  and thus the highest spot price   in practical terms  uprating a dam allows it to balance a larger amount of variable renewable energy sources on the grid such as wind farms and solar power plants  and to compensate for unscheduled shutdowns of baseload power plants  or brief surges in demand for electricity     load following power plants  also called intermediate power plants  are in between these extremes in terms of capacity factor  efficiency and cost per unit of electricity  they produce most of their electricity during the day  when prices and demand are highest  however  the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight     when it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power  wind power and hydroelectricity  there is a fourth reason for unused capacity  the plant may be capable of producing electricity  but its  fuel   wind  sunlight or water  may not be available  a hydroelectric plant s production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream  however  solar  wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors  so when they have fuel available  they are almost always able to produce electricity      when hydroelectric plants have water available  they are also useful for load following  because of their high dispatchability  a typical hydroelectric plant s operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes     wind farms are variable  due to the natural variability of the wind  for a wind farm  the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind  transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor  typical capacity factors of wind farms are between    and         solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth  seasonal changes  and because of cloud cover  according to   the sacramento municipal utility district observed a     capacity factor in       however  according to the solarpaces programme of the international energy agency  iea   solar power plants designed for solar only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as spain or the south western united states    although in some locations solar pv does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is zero      solarpaces states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power  csp  stations can be extended to become dispatchable  load following     the iea csp technology roadmap        suggests that  in the sunniest countries  csp can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by       and of base load power by      to          a dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power       geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources  and geothermal resources are available    hours a day    days a week  while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity  water  must be properly managed  the source of geothermal energy  the earth s heat  will be available for the foreseeable future    geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth     according to the us energy information administration  eia   in      the capacity factors were as follows       however they do tend to vary     the following figures were collected by the department of energy and climate change on the capacity factors for various types of plants in uk grid
