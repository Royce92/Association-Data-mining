 electronic mail  most commonly referred to as email or e mail since c        is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients  modern email operates across the internet or other computer networks  some early email systems required that the author and the recipient both be online at the same time  in common with instant messaging  today s email systems are based on a store and forward model  email servers accept  forward  deliver  and store messages  neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously  they need connect only briefly  typically to a mail server  for as long as it takes to send or receive messages  historically  the term electronic mail was used generically for any electronic document transmission  for example  several writers in the early     s used the term to describe fax document transmission    as a result  it is difficult to find the first citation for the use of the term with the more specific meaning it has today     an internet email message consists of three components  the message envelope  the message header  and the message body  the message header contains control information  including  minimally  an originator s email address and one or more recipient addresses  usually descriptive information is also added  such as a subject header field and a message submission date time stamp     originally a text only  ascii  communications medium  internet email was extended to carry  e g  text in other character sets  multi media content attachments  a process standardized in rfc      through       collectively  these rfcs have come to be called multipurpose internet mail extensions  mime   subsequent rfcs have proposed standards for internationalized email addresses using utf       electronic mail predates the inception of the internet and was in fact a crucial tool in creating it   but the history of modern  global internet email services reaches back to the early arpanet  standards for encoding email messages were proposed as early as       rfc       conversion from arpanet to the internet in the early     s produced the core of the current services  an email message sent in the early     s looks quite similar to a basic text message sent on the internet today     email is an information and communications technology  it uses technology to communicate a digital message over the internet  users use email differently  based on how they think about it  there are many software platforms available to send and receive  popular email platforms include gmail  hotmail  yahoo  mail  outlook  and many others      network based email was initially exchanged on the arpanet in extensions to the file transfer protocol  ftp   but is now carried by the simple mail transfer protocol  smtp   first published as internet standard     rfc      in       in the process of transporting email messages between systems  smtp communicates delivery parameters using a message envelope separate from the message  header and body  itself             electronic mail has several english spelling options that occasionally are the cause of vehement disagreement     the autodin network  first operational in       provided a message service between       terminals  handling    million messages per month  with an average message length of approximately       characters  autodin was supported by    large computerized switches  and was connected to the united states general services administration advanced record system  which provided similar services to roughly       terminals       with the introduction of mit s compatible time sharing system  ctss  in        multiple users were able to log into a central system   from remote dial up terminals  and to store and share files on the central disk    informal methods of using this to pass messages were developed and expandedxa      developers of other early systems developed similar email applications     these original messaging systems had widely different features and ran on systems that were incompatible with each other  most of them only allowed communication between users logged into the same host or  mainframe   although there might be hundreds or thousands of users within an organization     in the early     s  networked personal computers on lans became increasingly important  server based systems similar to the earlier mainframe systems were developed  again  these systems initially allowed communication only between users logged into the same server infrastructure  examples include     eventually these systems too could link different organizations as long as they ran the same email system and proprietary protocol       to facilitate electronic mail exchange between remote sites and with other organizations  telecommunication links  such as dialup modems or leased lines  provided means to transport email globally  creating local and global networks     early interoperability among independent systems included     in the early     s  ray tomlinson updated an existing utility called sndmsg so that it could copy messages  as files  over the network  lawrence roberts the project manager for the arpanet development  took the idea of readmail  which dumped all  recent  messages onto the user s terminal  and wrote a programme for tenex in teco macros called rd  which permitted access to individual messages    barry wessler then updated rd and called it nrd       marty yonke rewrote nrd to include reading  access to sndmsg for sending  and a help system  and called the utility wrd  which was later known as bananard  john vittal then updated this version to include three important commands  move  combined save delete command   answer  determined to whom a reply should be sent  and forward  sent an email to a person who was not already a recipient   the system was called msg  with inclusion of these features  msg is considered to be the first integrated modern email programme  from which many other applications have descended       experimental email transfers between separate computer systems began shortly after the creation of the arpanet in         ray tomlinson is generally credited as having sent the first email across a network  initiating the use of the     sign to separate the names of the user and the user s machine in       when he sent a message from one digital equipment corporation dec    computer to another dec     the two machines were placed next to each other      tomlinson s work was quickly adopted across the arpanet  which significantly increased the popularity of email  for many years  email was the killer app of the arpanet and then the internet     as the influence of the arpanet and later the internet grew  gateways were developed to pass mail between it and other networks such as janet  bitnet  x      fidonet  and uucp  this often involved addresses such as     despite the complex format of some such addresses   in this case an internet email address to route mail to a user with a  bang path  address at a uucp host   they did lead to the universal connectivity that is the key feature of modern email     the diagram to the right shows a typical sequence of events   that takes place when alice composes a message using her mail user agent  mua   she enters the email address of her correspondent  and hits the  send  button      this server may need to forward the message to other mtas before the message reaches the final message delivery agent  mda      that sequence of events applies to the majority of email users  however  there are many alternative possibilities and complications to the email system     many mtas used to accept messages for any recipient on the internet and do their best to deliver them  such mtas are called open mail relays  this was very important in the early days of the internet when network connections were unreliable  if an mta couldn t reach the destination  it could at least deliver it to a relay closer to the destination  the relay stood a better chance of delivering the message at a later time  however  this mechanism proved to be exploitable by people sending unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence very few modern mtas are open mail relays  and many mtas don t accept messages from open mail relays because such messages are very likely to be spam     the internet email message format is now defined by rfc       with multi media content attachments being defined in rfc      through rfc       collectively called multipurpose internet mail extensions or mime  rfc      replaced the earlier rfc      in       and in turn rfc      in      replaced rfc       which had been the standard for internet email for nearly    years  published in       rfc     was based on the earlier rfc     for the arpanet       internet email messages consist of two major sections     the header is separated from the body by a blank line     each message has exactly one header  which is structured into fields  each field has a name and a value  rfc      specifies the precise syntax     informally  each line of text in the header that begins with a printable character begins a separate field  the field name starts in the first character of the line and ends before the separator character      the separator is then followed by the field value  the  body  of the field   the value is continued onto subsequent lines if those lines have a space or tab as their first character  field names and values are restricted to   bit ascii characters  non ascii values may be represented using mime encoded words     email header fields can be multi line  and each line should be at most    characters long and in no event more than     characters long    header fields defined by rfc      can only contain us ascii characters  for encoding characters in other sets  a syntax specified in rfc      can be used    recently the ietf eai working group has defined some standards track extensions      replacing previous experimental extensions  to allow utf   encoded unicode characters to be used within the header  in particular  this allows email addresses to use non ascii characters  such characters must only be used by servers that support these extensions     the message header must include at least the following fields       the message header should include at least the following fields       rfc      describes registration procedures for message header fields at the iana  it provides for permanent and provisional message header field names  including also fields defined for mime  netnews  and http  and referencing relevant rfcs  common header fields for email include       note that the to  field is not necessarily related to the addresses to which the message is delivered  the actual delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol  smtp  which may or may not originally have been extracted from the header content  the  to   field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter which is delivered according to the address on the outer envelope  in the same way  the  from   field does not have to be the real sender of the email message  some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages being relayed  data pertaining to server s activity is also part of the header  as defined below     smtp defines the trace information of a message  which is also saved in the header using the following two fields       other header fields that are added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields  in a broader sense       email was originally designed for   bit ascii    most email software is   bit clean but must assume it will communicate with   bit servers and mail readers  the mime standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non ascii data  quoted printable for mostly   bit content with a few characters outside that range and base   for arbitrary binary data  the  bitmime and binary extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings  but many mail transport agents still do not support them fully  in some countries  several encoding schemes coexist  as the result  by default  the message in a non latin alphabet language appears in non readable form  the only exception is coincidence  when the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme   therefore  for international character sets  unicode is growing in popularity citation needed    most modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or html for the message body at the option of the user  html email messages often include an automatically generated plain text copy as well  for compatibility reasons     advantages of html include the ability to include in line links and images  set apart previous messages in block quotes  wrap naturally on any display  use emphasis such as underlines and italics  and change font styles  disadvantages include the increased size of the email  privacy concerns about web bugs  abuse of html email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software       some web based mailing lists recommend that all posts be made in plain text  with    or    characters per line     for all the above reasons  but also because they have a significant number of readers using text based email clients such as mutt     some microsoft email clients allow rich formatting using rtf  but unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client this should be avoided       in order to ensure that html sent in an email is rendered properly by the recipient s client software  an additional header must be specified when sending   content type  text html   most email programs send this header automatically citation needed    messages are exchanged between hosts using the simple mail transfer protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents  mtas   and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents  mdas  also sometimes called local delivery agents  ldas   users can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as pop or imap  or  as is more likely in a large corporate environment  with a proprietary protocol specific to novell groupwise  lotus notes or microsoft exchange servers  webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser  from any computer  rather than relying on an email client  programs used by users for retrieving  reading  and managing email are called mail user agents  muas      mail can be stored on the client  on the server side  or in both places  standard formats for mailboxes include maildir and mbox  several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them  server side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as imap  moving email from one server to another can be done with any mua supporting the protocol     accepting a message obliges an mta to deliver it    and when a message cannot be delivered  that mta must send a bounce message back to the sender  indicating the problem     upon reception of email messages  email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system  some clients save individual messages as separate files  while others use various database formats  often proprietary  for collective storage  a historical standard of storage is the mbox format  the specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions     some applications  like apple mail  leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments  others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory     mobile devices  such as cell phones and tablet computers  commonly have the ability to receive email  since users may always have their mobile device with them  users may access email significantly faster on these devices than through other methods  such as desktop computers or laptops     the uri scheme  as registered with the iana  defines the mailto  scheme for smtp email addresses  though its use is not strictly defined  urls of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user s mail client when the url is activated  with the address as defined by the url in the to  field       many email providers have a web based email client  e g  aol mail  gmail  outlook com and yahoo  mail   this allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email  mail is typically not downloaded to the client  so can t be read without a current internet connection     pop  is the acronym for post office protocol    in a pop  email account  email messages are downloaded to the client device  i e  a computer  and then they are deleted from the mail server unless specific instruction to save has been given   it is difficult to save and view messages on multiple devices  also  the messages sent from the computer one device are not copied to the sent items folder on the  other  devices  the messages are deleted from the server to make room for more incoming messages  pop supports simple download and delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes  termed maildrop in the pop rfc s     although most pop clients have an option to leave messages on the server after downloading a copy of them  most email clients using pop  simply connect  retrieve all messages  store them on the client device as new messages  delete them from the server  and then disconnect     imap refers to internet message access protocol  with an imap account  a user s account has access to mail folders on the mail server and can use any compatible device to read and reply to messages  as long as such a device can access the server  small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while travelling  and to make brief replies  larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length  imap shows the headers of messages  the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages  usually mail is left in folders in the mail server     messaging application programming interface  mapi  is a messaging architecture and a component object model based api for microsoft windows     flaming occurs when a person sends a message with angry or antagonistic content  the term is derived from the use of the word incendiary to describe particularly heated email discussions  flaming is assumed to be more common today because of the ease and impersonality of email communications  confrontations in person or via telephone require direct interaction  where social norms encourage civility  whereas typing a message to another person is an indirect interaction  so civility may be forgotten     also known as  email fatigue   email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them  the reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all  as a solution  people occasionally send a boilerplate message explaining that the email inbox is being cleared out  harvard university law professor lawrence lessig is credited with coining this term  but he may only have popularized it       email was widely accepted by the business community as the first broad electronic communication medium and was the first  e revolution  in business communication  email is very simple to understand and like postal mail  email solves two basic problems of communication  logistics and synchronization  see below      lan based email is also an emerging form of usage for business  it not only allows the business user to download mail when offline  it also allows the small business user to have multiple users  email ids with just one email connection     most business workers today spend from one to two hours of their working day using email  reading  ordering  sorting   re contextualizing  fragmented information  and writing email    the use of email is increasing worldwide     despite these disadvantages  email has become the most widely used medium of communication within the business world  a      study on workplace communication by paytronics found     of u s  knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work       marketing research suggests that opt in email marketing can be viewed as useful by consumers if it contains information such as special sales offerings and new product information  offering interesting hyperlinks or generic information on consumer trends is less useful    this research by martin et al         also shows that if consumers find email marketing useful  they are likely to visit a store  thereby overcoming limitations of internet marketing such as not being able to touch or try on a product     email users attach a higher level of formality  in regards to other icts  users tended to associate the medium for communicating with professors  bosses  and those who they maintained professional relationships with  the degree of formality attached to email varies across users  so email is neither a more formal or less formal ict than others       all users of email use the medium differently  with structural functionalism  people will attach various meanings to influence how they use the medium  for example  while one person might use email to communicate with their friends or fellow students on a weekly basis  and another may use it to keep in touch with family members on a daily basis  the situational setting  for example  a student will find him or herself in a different situation than a stay at home mom  in which the user finds himself or herself in shapes how and what email will be used for     email has become widely used on smart phones  mobile apps for email increase accessibility to the medium  while before users could only access email on computers  it is now possible for users to check their email out of the home and out of the library while on the go  alerts can also be sent to the phone to notify them immediately of new messages  this has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day     it was found that us adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their facebook accounts  making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smart phones      of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone    it was also found that     of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email  and     were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone  however  the percentage of consumers using email on smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries  for example  in comparison to     of those consumers in the us who used it  only     in india did       email messages may have one or more attachments  i e  mime parts intended to provide copies of files  attachments serve the purpose of delivering binary or text files of unspecified size  in principle there is no technical intrinsic restriction in the internetmessage format  smtp protocol or mime limiting the size or number of attachments  in practice  however  email service providers implement various limitations on the permissible size of files or the size of an entire message     furthermore  due to technical reasons  often a small attachment can increase in size when sent    which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can or cannot send a file by email  and this can result in their message being rejected     as larger and larger file sizes are being created and traded  many users are either forced to upload and download their files using an ftp server  or more popularly  use online file sharing facilities or services  usually over web friendly http  in order to send and receive them     a december      new york times blog post described information overload as  a      billion drag on the economy     and the new york times reported in april      that  e mail has become the bane of some people s professional lives  due to information overload  yet  none of the current wave of high profile internet start ups focused on email really eliminates the problem of email overload because none helps us prepare replies     gigaom posted a similar article in september       highlighting research that found     of knowledge workers were overwhelmed by the volume of email they received    technology investors reflect similar concerns       in october       cnn published an article titled  happy information overload day  that compiled research about email overload from it companies and productivity experts  according to basex  the average knowledge worker receives    messages per day  subsequent studies have reported higher numbers    marsha egan  an email productivity expert  called email technology both a blessing and a curse in the article  she stated   everyone just learns that they have to have it dinging and flashing and open just in case the boss e mails   she said   the best gift any group can give each other is to never use e mail urgently  if you need it within three hours  pick up the phone        the usefulness of email is being threatened by four phenomena  email bombardment  spamming  phishing  and email worms     spamming is unsolicited commercial  or bulk  email  because of the minuscule cost of sending email  spammers can send hundreds of millions of email messages each day over an inexpensive internet connection  hundreds of active spammers sending this volume of mail results in information overload for many computer users who receive voluminous unsolicited email each day         email worms use email as a way of replicating themselves into vulnerable computers  although the first email worm affected unix computers  the problem is most common today on the microsoft windows operating system     the combination of spam and worm programs results in users receiving a constant drizzle of junk email  which reduces the usefulness of email as a practical tool     a number of anti spam techniques mitigate the impact of spam  in the united states  u s  congress has also passed a law  the can spam act of       attempting to regulate such email  australia also has very strict spam laws restricting the sending of spam from an australian isp    but its impact has been minimal since most spam comes from regimes that seem reluctant to regulate the sending of spam citation needed    email spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source  email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin     email bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address  the overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash     today it can be important to distinguish between internet and internal email systems  internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender s or the recipient s control  during the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content  internal mail systems  in which the information never leaves the organizational network  may be more secure  although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees     email privacy  without some security precautions  can be compromised because     there are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above  for example  virtual private networks or the tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while gpg  pgp  smemail    or s mime can be used for end to end message encryption  and smtp starttls or smtp over transport layer security secure sockets layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the smtp client and the smtp server     additionally  many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords  making them easy to intercept by an attacker  encrypted authentication schemes such as sasl prevent this     finally  attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer to peer filesharing  attached files may contain trojans or viruses     the original smtp mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message  and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read  it requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice  bounce message   but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost  to remedy this  the ietf introduced delivery status notifications  delivery receipts  and message disposition notifications  return receipts   however  these are not universally deployed in production   a complete message tracking mechanism was also defined  but it never gained traction  see rfcs        through              many isps now deliberately disable non delivery reports  ndrs  and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers     in the absence of standard methods  a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed  however  these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns           and only work with e mail clients that support rendering of html  many mail clients now default to not showing  web content      webmail providors can also disrupt web bugs by pre caching images        the u s  state and federal governments have been involved in electronic messaging and the development of email in several different ways     starting in       the u s  postal service  usps  recognized that electronic messaging and electronic transactions posed a significant threat to first class mail volumes and revenue  the usps explored an electronic messaging initiative in      and later disbanded it  twenty years later  in       when email volume overtook postal mail volume  the usps was again urged to embrace email  and the usps declined to provide email as a service           the usps initiated an experimental email service known as e com  e com provided a method for the simple exchange of text messages  in       shortly after the usps reported its state of financial bankruptcy  the usps office of inspector general  oig  began exploring the possibilities of generating revenue through email servicing           electronic messages were transmitted to a post office  printed out  and delivered as hard copy  to take advantage of the service  an individual had to transmit at least     messages  the delivery time of the messages was the same as first class mail and cost    cents  both the postal regulatory commission and the federal communications commission opposed e com  the fcc concluded that e com constituted common carriage under its jurisdiction and the usps would have to file a tariff     three years after initiating the service  usps canceled e com and attempted to sell it off                       the early arpanet dealt with multiple email clients that had various  and at times incompatible  formats  for example  in the multics  the     sign meant  kill line  and anything before the     sign was ignored  so multics users had to use a command line option to specify the destination system    the department of defense darpa desired to have uniformity and interoperability for email and therefore funded efforts to drive towards unified inter operable standards  this led to david crocker  john vittal  kenneth pogran  and austin henderson publishing rfc       standard for the format of arpa network text message   november            a subset of which provided a stable base for common use on the arpanet  but which was not fully effective  and in       a meeting was held at bbn to resolve incompatibility issues  jon postel recounted the meeting in rfc       summary of computer mail services meeting held at bbn on    january        march           which includes an appendix listing the varying email systems at the time  this  in turn  lead to the release of david crocker s rfc       standard for the format of arpa internet text messages   august               rfc     is a small adaptation of rfc     s details  notably enhancing the host portion  to use domain names  that were being developed at the same time     the national science foundation took over operations of the arpanet and internet from the department of defense  and initiated nsfnet  a new backbone for the network  a part of the nsfnet aup forbade commercial traffic     in       vint cerf arranged for an interconnection of mci mail with nsfnet on an experimental basis  the following year compuserve email interconnected with nsfnet  within a few years the commercial traffic restriction was removed from nsfnets aup  and nsfnet was privatised     in the late     s  the federal trade commission grew concerned with fraud transpiring in email  and initiated a series of procedures on spam  fraud  and phishing     in       ftc jurisdiction over spam was codified into law in the form of the can spam act     several other u s  federal agencies have also exercised jurisdiction including the department of justice and the secret service     nasa has provided email capabilities to astronauts aboard the space shuttle and international space station since      when a macintosh portable was used aboard space shuttle mission sts    to send the first email via applelink           today astronauts aboard the international space station have email capabilities via the wireless networking throughout the station and are connected to the ground at    mbit s earth to station and   mbit s station to earth  comparable to home dsl connection speeds
