in maintenance mode with the following announcement  emphasis added        as anyone looking for decent support or even useful information over the past few months can attest  the revival of textdrive has not been a success     what began in mid      as an exciting challenge fuelled by good intentions and lean resources quickly turned into a cleanup project with almost no resources  it is disappointing to report that after a year and a half of uphill battles and unimagined setbacks  after several costly efforts to regroup and find another way  options to keep textdrive growing have run out  and we will cease operations on the   th of march        for those who wish to know  details of what went wrong will be made available once shutdown operations have completed  sorry to have let you down
