 computer security is security applied to computing devices such as computers and smartphones  as well as computer networks such as private and public networks  including the whole internet  the field includes all the processes and mechanisms by which digital equipment  information and services are protected from unintended or unauthorized access  change or destruction  and is of growing importance due to the increasing reliance of computer systems in most societies   it includes physical security to prevent theft of equipment and information security to protect the data on that equipment  it is sometimes referred to as  cyber security  or  it security   those terms generally do not refer to physical security  but a common belief among computer security experts is that a physical security breach is one of the worst kinds of security breaches as it generally allows full access to both data and equipment     cybersecurity is the process of applying security measures to ensure confidentiality  integrity  and availability of data  cybersecurity attempts to assure the protection of assets  which includes data  desktops  servers  buildings  and most importantly  humans  the goal of cybersecurity is to protect data both in transit and at rest  countermeasures can be put in place in order to increase the security of data  some of these measures include  but are not limited to  access control  awareness training  audit and accountability  risk assessment  penetration testing  vulnerability management  and security assessment and authorization              a vulnerability is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system s information assurance  vulnerability is the intersection of three elements  a system susceptibility or flaw  attacker access to the flaw  and attacker capability to exploit the flaw  to exploit a vulnerability  an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness  in this frame  vulnerability is also known as the attack surface     a large number of vulnerabilities are documented in the common vulnerabilities and exposures  cve  database www cve org    vulnerability management is the cyclical practice of identifying  classifying  remediating  and mitigating vulnerabilities  this practice generally refers to software vulnerabilities in computing systems     a security risk may be classified as a vulnerability  the use of vulnerability with the same meaning of risk can lead to confusion  the risk is tied to the potential of a significant loss  there can also be vulnerabilities without risk  like when the asset has no value  a vulnerability with one or more known  publicly or privately  instances of working and fully implemented attacks is classified as an exploitable vulnerability  a vulnerability for which an exploit exists  to exploit those vulnerabilities  perpetrators  individual hacker  criminal organization  or a nation state  most commonly use malware  malicious software   worms  viruses  and targeted attacks     different scales exist to assess the risk of an attack  in the united states  authorities use the information operations condition  infocon  system  this system is scaled from   to    infocon   being an harmless situation and infocon   representing the most critical threats      to understand the techniques for securing a computer system  it is important to first understand the various types of  attacks  that can be made against it  these threats can typically be classified into one of the categories in the section below     a backdoor in a computer system  a cryptosystem or an algorithm  is a method of bypassing normal authentication  securing remote access to a computer  obtaining access to plaintext  and so on  while attempting to remain undetected  a special form of asymmetric encryption attacks  known as kleptographic attack  resists to be useful to the reverse engineer even after it is detected and analyzed     the backdoor may take the form of an installed program  e g   back orifice   or could be a modification to an existing program or hardware device  a specific form of backdoor is a rootkit  which replaces system binaries and or hooks into the function calls of an operating system to hide the presence of other programs  users  services and open ports  it may also fake information about disk and memory usage     unlike other exploits  denial of service attacks are not used to gain unauthorized access or control of a system  they are instead designed to render it unusable  attackers can deny service to individual victims  such as by deliberately entering a wrong password enough consecutive times to cause the victim account to be locked  or they may overload the capabilities of a machine or network and block all users at once  these types of attack are  in practice  difficult to prevent  because the behaviour of whole networks needs to be analyzed  not just the behaviour of small pieces of code  distributed denial of service  ddos  attacks  where a large number of compromised hosts  commonly referred to as  zombie computers   used as part of a botnet with  for example  a worm  trojan horse  or backdoor exploit to control them  are used to flood a target system with network requests  thus attempting to render it unusable through resource exhaustion  are common  another technique to exhaust victim resources is through the use of an attack amplifier  where the attacker takes advantage of poorly designed protocols on third party machines  such as ntp or dns  in order to instruct these hosts to launch the flood  some vulnerabilities in applications or operating systems can be exploited to make the computer or application malfunction or crash to create a denial of service     an unauthorized user gaining physical access to a computer  or part thereof  can perform many functions or install different types of devices to compromise security  including operating system modifications  software worms  keyloggers  and covert listening devices  the attacker can also easily download large quantities of data onto backup media  like cd r dvd r or portable devices such as flash drives  digital cameras or digital audio players  another common technique is to boot an operating system contained on a cd rom or other bootable media and read the data from the harddrive s  this way  the only way to prevent this is to encrypt the storage media and store the key separate from the system  direct access attacks are the only type of threat to air gapped computers in most cases     eavesdropping is the act of surreptitiously listening to a private conversation  typically between hosts on a network  for instance  programs such as carnivore and narusinsight have been used by the fbi and nsa to eavesdrop on the systems of internet service providers  even machines that operate as a closed system  i e   with no contact to the outside world  can be eavesdropped upon via monitoring the faint electro magnetic transmissions generated by the hardware  tempest is a specification by the nsa referring to these attacks     spoofing of user identity describes a situation in which one person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data     tampering describes an intentional modification of products in a way that would make them harmful to the consumer     repudiation describes a situation where the authenticity of a signature is being challenged     information disclosure  privacy breach or data leak  describes a situation where information  thought to be secure  is released in an untrusted environment     privilege escalation describes a situation where an attacker gains elevated privileges or access to resources that were once restricted to them     an exploit is a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system  this frequently includes gaining control of a computer system  allowing privilege escalation  or creating a denial of service attack  the code from exploits is frequently reused in trojan horses and computer viruses  in some cases  a vulnerability can lie in certain programs  processing of a specific file type  such as a non executable media file  some security web sites maintain lists of currently known unpatched vulnerabilities found in common programs     a computer system is no more secure than the persons responsible for its operation  malicious individuals have regularly penetrated well designed  secure computer systems by taking advantage of the carelessness of trusted individuals  or by deliberately deceiving them  for example sending messages that they are the system administrator and asking for passwords  this deception is known as social engineering     in the world of information technology there are different types of cyber attack like code injection to a website or utilising malware  malicious software  such as virus  trojans  or similar  attacks of these kinds are counteracted managing or improving the damaged product  but there is one last type  social engineering  which does not directly affect the computers but instead their users  which are also known as  the weakest link   this type of attack is capable of achieving similar results to other class of cyber attacks  by going around the infrastructure established to resist malicious software  since being more difficult to calculate or prevent  it is many times a more efficient attack vector     the main target is to convince the user by means of psychological ways to disclose secrets such as passwords  card numbers  etc  by  for example  impersonating a bank  a contractor  or a customer      an indirect attack is an attack launched by a third party computer  by using someone else s computer to launch an attack  it becomes far more difficult to track down the actual attacker  there have also been cases where attackers took advantage of public anonymizing systems  such as the tor onion router system     computer crime refers to any crime that involves a computer and a network      computer security is critical in almost any industry which uses computers      web sites that accept or store credit card numbers and bank account information are prominent hacking targets  because of the potential for immediate financial gain from transferring money  making purchases  or selling the information on the black market  in store payment systems and atms have also been tampered with in order to gather customer account data and pins     computers control functions at many utilities  including coordination of telecommunications  the power grid  nuclear power plants  and valve opening and closing in water and gas networks  the internet is a potential attack vector for such machines if connected  but the stuxnet worm demonstrated that even equipment controlled by computers not connected to the internet can be vulnerable to physical damage caused by malicious commands sent to industrial equipment  in that case uranium enrichment centrifuges  which are infected via removable media     the aviation industry is especially important when analyzing computer security because the involved risks include human life  expensive equipment  cargo  and transportation infrastructure  security can be compromised by hardware and software malpractice  human error  and faulty operating environments  threats that exploit computer vulnerabilities can stem from sabotage  espionage  industrial competition  terrorist attack  mechanical malfunction  and human error      the consequences of a successful deliberate or inadvertent misuse of a computer system in the aviation industry range from loss of confidentiality to loss of system integrity  which may lead to more serious concerns such as exfiltration  data theft or loss   network and air traffic control outages  which in turn can lead to airport closures  loss of aircraft  loss of passenger life  military systems that control munitions can pose an even greater risk     a proper attack does not need to be very high tech or well funded  for a power outage at an airport alone can cause repercussions worldwide   one of the easiest and  arguably  the most difficult to trace security vulnerabilities is achievable by transmitting unauthorized communications over specific radio frequencies  these transmissions may spoof air traffic controllers or simply disrupt communications altogether   controlling aircraft over oceans is especially dangerous because radar surveillance only extends     to     miles offshore  beyond the radar s sight controllers must rely on periodic radio communications with a third party    another attack vector of concern is onboard wifi systems       desktop computers and laptops are commonly infected with malware  either to gather passwords or financial account information  or to construct a botnet to attack another target  smart phones  tablet computers  smart watches  and other mobile devices have also recently become targets for malware     many smartphones have cameras  microphones  gps receivers  compasses  and accelerometers  many quantified self devices  such as activity trackers  and mobile apps collect personal information  such as heartbeat  diet  notes on activities  from exercise in public to sexual activities   and performance of bodily functions  wifi  bluetooth  and cell phone network devices can be used as attack vectors  and sensors might be remotely activated after a successful attack  many mobile applications do not use encryption to transmit this data  nor to protect usernames and passwords  leaving the devices and the web sites where data is stored vulnerable to monitoring and break ins       hacking techniques have also been demonstrated against home automation devices such as the nest thermostat       data breaches at large corporations have become common  largely for financial gain through identity theft  notably  the      sony pictures entertainment hack was carried out by the government of north korea or its supporters  in retaliation for an unflattering caricature and fictional assassination of supreme leader kim jong un     with physical access to a car s internal controller area network  hackers have demonstrated the ability to disable the brakes and turn the steering wheel    computerized engine timing  cruise control  anti lock brakes  seat belt tensioners  door locks  airbags and advanced driver assistance systems make these disruptions possible  and self driving cars go even further  connected cars may use wifi and bluetooth to communicate with onboard consumer devices  and the cell phone network to contact concierge and emergency assistance services or get navigational or entertainment information  each of these networks is a potential entry point for malware or an attacker    researchers in      were even able to use a malicious compact disc in a car s stereo system as a successful attack vector    and cars with built in voice recognition or remote assistance features have onboard microphones which could be used for eavesdropping  a      report by u s  senator edward markey criticized manufacturers  security measures as inadequate and also highlighted privacy concerns about driving  location  and diagnostic data being collected  which is vulnerable to abuse by both manufacturers and hackers       military installations have been the target of hacks  vital government infrastructure such as traffic light controls  police and intelligence agency communications  and financial systems are also potential targets as they become computerized     serious financial damage has been caused by security breaches  but because there is no standard model for estimating the cost of an incident  the only data available is that which is made public by the organizations involved   several computer security consulting firms produce estimates of total worldwide losses attributable to virus and worm attacks and to hostile digital acts in general  the      loss estimates by these firms range from     billion  worms and viruses only  to      billion  for all forms of covert attacks   the reliability of these estimates is often challenged  the underlying methodology is basically anecdotal        insecurities in operating systems have led to a massive black marketcitation needed for rogue software  an attacker can use a security hole to install software that tricks the user into buying a product  at that point  an affiliate program pays the affiliate responsible for generating that installation about      the software is sold for between     and     per license       there are many similarities  yet many fundamental differences  between computer and physical security  just like real world security  the motivations for breaches of computer security vary between attackers  sometimes called hackers or crackers  some are thrill seekers or vandals  the kind often responsible for defacing web sites   similarly  some web site defacements are done to make political statements  however  some attackers are highly skilled and motivated with the goal of compromising computers for financial gain or espionage citation needed an example of the latter is markus hess  more diligent than skilled   who spied for the kgb and was ultimately caught because of the efforts of clifford stoll  who wrote a memoir  the cuckoo s egg  about his experiences     for those seeking to prevent security breaches  the first step is usually to attempt to identify what might motivate an attack on the system  how much the continued operation and information security of the system are worth  and who might be motivated to breach it  the precautions required for a home personal computer are very different for those of banks  internet banking systems  and different again for a classified military network  other computer security writers suggest that  since an attacker using a network need know nothing about you or what you have on your computer  attacker motivation is inherently impossible to determine beyond guessing  if true  blocking all possible attacks is the only plausible action to take     there are numerous ways to protect computers  including utilizing security aware design techniques  building on secure operating systems and installing hardware devices designed to protect the computer systems     in general  a countermeasure is a measure or action taken to counter or offset another one  in computer security a countermeasure is defined as an action  device  procedure  or technique that reduces a threat  a vulnerability  or an attack by eliminating or preventing it  by minimizing the harm it can cause  or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken      an alternate meaning of countermeasure from the infosectoday glossary   is     although there are many aspects to take into consideration when designing a computer system  security can prove to be very important  according to symantec  in          percent of organizations polled expect to implement security improvements to their computer systems  with    percent claiming cyber security as their top risk       at the same time  many organizations are improving security and many types of cyber criminals are finding ways to continue their activities  almost every type of cyber attack is on the rise  in      respondents to the csi computer crime and security survey admitted that malware infections  denial of service attacks  password sniffing  and web site defacements were significantly higher than in the previous two years       a state of computer  security  is the conceptual ideal  attained by the use of the three processes  threat prevention  detection  and response  these processes are based on various policies and system components  which include the following     today  computer security comprises mainly  preventive  measures  like firewalls or an exit procedure  a firewall can be defined as a way of filtering network data between a host or a network and another network  such as the internet  and can be implemented as software running on the machine  hooking into the network stack  or  in the case of most unix based operating systems such as linux  built into the operating system kernel  to provide real time filtering and blocking  another implementation is a so called physical firewall which consists of a separate machine filtering network traffic  firewalls are common amongst machines that are permanently connected to the internet     however  relatively few organisations maintain computer systems with effective detection systems  and fewer still have organised response mechanisms in place  as result  as reuters points out   companies for the first time report they are losing more through electronic theft of data than physical stealing of assets     the primary obstacle to effective eradication of cyber crime could be traced to excessive reliance on firewalls and other automated  detection  systems  yet it is basic evidence gathering by using packet capture appliances that puts criminals behind bars     responding forcefully to attempted security breaches  in the manner that one would for attempted physical security breaches  is often very difficult for a variety of reasons     computer code is regarded by some as a form of mathematics  it is theoretically possible to prove the correctness of certain classes of computer programs  though the feasibility of actually achieving this in large scale practical systems is regarded as small by some with practical experience in the industry  see bruce schneier et al     it is also possible to protect messages in transit  i e   communications  by means of cryptography  one method of encryption the one time pad is unbreakable when correctly used  this method was used by the soviet union during the cold war  though flaws in their implementation allowed some cryptanalysis  see the venona project  the method uses a matching pair of key codes  securely distributed  which are used once and only once to encode and decode a single message  for transmitted computer encryption this method is difficult to use properly  securely   and highly inconvenient as well  other methods of encryption  while breakable in theory  are often virtually impossible to directly break by any means publicly known today  breaking them requires some non cryptographic input  such as a stolen key  stolen plaintext  at either end of the transmission   or some other extra cryptanalytic information     social engineering and direct computer access  physical  attacks can only be prevented by non computer means  which can be difficult to enforce  relative to the sensitivity of the information  even in a highly disciplined environment  such as in military organizations  social engineering attacks can still be difficult to foresee and prevent     trusting computer program code to behave securely has been pursued for decades  it has proven difficult to determine what code  will never do   mathematical proofs are illusive in part because it is so difficult to define secure behavior even notionally  let alone mathematically  in practice  only a small fraction of computer program code is mathematically proven  or even goes through comprehensive information technology audits or inexpensive but extremely valuable computer security audits  so it is usually possible for a determined hacker to read  copy  alter or destroy data in well secured computers  albeit at the cost of great time and resources  few attackers would audit applications for vulnerabilities just to attack a single specific system  it is possible to reduce an attacker s chances by keeping systems up to date  using a security scanner or and hiring competent people responsible for security  the effects of data loss damage can be reduced by careful backing up and insurance  however software based strategies have not yet been discovered for protecting computers from adequately funded  dedicated malicious attacks     security by design  or alternately secure by design  means that the software has been designed from the ground up to be secure  in this case  security is considered as a main feature     some of the techniques in this approach include     the open security architecture organization defines it security architecture as  the design artifacts that describe how the security controls  security countermeasures  are positioned  and how they relate to the overall information technology architecture  these controls serve the purpose to maintain the system s quality attributes  confidentiality  integrity  availability  accountability and assurance services        techopedia defines security architecture as  a unified security design that addresses the necessities and potential risks involved in a certain scenario or environment  it also specifies when and where to apply security controls  the design process is generally reproducible   the key attributes of security architecture are       while hardware may be a source of insecurity  such as with microchip vulnerabilities maliciously introduced during the manufacturing process      hardware based or assisted computer security also offers an alternative to software only computer security  using devices and methods such as dongles  trusted platform modules  intrusion aware cases  drive locks  disabling usb ports  and mobile enabled access may be considered more secure due to the physical access  or sophisticated backdoor access  required in order to be compromised  each of these is covered in more detail below     one use of the term  computer security  refers to technology that is used to implement secure operating systems  much of this technology is based on science developed in the     s and used to produce what may be some of the most impenetrable operating systems ever  though still valid  the technology is in limited use today  primarily because it imposes some changes to system management and also because it is not widely understood  such ultra strong secure operating systems are based on operating system kernel technology that can guarantee that certain security policies are absolutely enforced in an operating environment  an example of such a computer security policy is the bell lapadula model  the strategy is based on a coupling of special microprocessor hardware features  often involving the memory management unit  to a special correctly implemented operating system kernel  this forms the foundation for a secure operating system which  if certain critical parts are designed and implemented correctly  can ensure the absolute impossibility of penetration by hostile elements  this capability is enabled because the configuration not only imposes a security policy  but in theory completely protects itself from corruption  ordinary operating systems  on the other hand  lack the features that assure this maximal level of security  the design methodology to produce such secure systems is precise  deterministic and logical     systems designed with such methodology represent the state of the artclarification needed of computer security although products using such security are not widely known  in sharp contrast to most kinds of software  they meet specifications with verifiable certainty comparable to specifications for size  weight and power  secure operating systems designed this way are used primarily to protect national security information  military secrets  and the data of international financial institutions  these are very powerful security tools and very few secure operating systems have been certified at the highest level  orange book a    to operate over the range of  top secret  to  unclassified   including honeywell scomp  usaf sacdin  nsa blacker and boeing mls lan   the assurance of security depends not only on the soundness of the design strategy  but also on the assurance of correctness of the implementation  and therefore there are degrees of security strength defined for compusec  the common criteria quantifies security strength of products in terms of two components  security functionality and assurance level  such as eal levels   and these are specified in a protection profile for requirements and a security target for product descriptions  none of these ultra high assurance secure general purpose operating systems have been produced for decades or certified under common criteria     in usa parlance  the term high assurance usually suggests the system has the right security functions that are implemented robustly enough to protect dod and doe classified information  medium assurance suggests it can protect less valuable information  such as income tax information  secure operating systems designed to meet medium robustness levels of security functionality and assurance have seen wider use within both government and commercial markets  medium robust systems may provide the same security functions as high assurance secure operating systems but do so at a lower assurance level  such as common criteria levels eal  or eal    lower levels mean we can be less certain that the security functions are implemented flawlessly  and therefore less dependable  these systems are found in use on web servers  guards  database servers  and management hosts and are used not only to protect the data stored on these systems but also to provide a high level of protection for network connections and routing services     if the operating environment is not based on a secure operating system capable of maintaining a domain for its own execution  and capable of protecting application code from malicious subversion  and capable of protecting the system from subverted code  then high degrees of security are understandably not possible  while such secure operating systems are possible and have been implemented  most commercial systems fall in a  low security  category because they rely on features not supported by secure operating systems  like portability  and others   in low security operating environments  applications must be relied on to participate in their own protection  there are  best effort  secure coding practices that can be followed to make an application more resistant to malicious subversion     in commercial environments  the majority of software subversion vulnerabilities result from a few known kinds of coding defects  common software defects include buffer overflows  format string vulnerabilities  integer overflow  and code command injection  these defects can be used to cause the target system to execute putative data  however  the  data  contain executable instructions  allowing the attacker to gain control of the processor     some common languages such as c and c   are vulnerable to all of these defects  see seacord   secure coding in c and c        other languages  such as java  are more resistant to some of these defects  but are still prone to code command injection and other software defects which facilitate subversion     another bad coding practice occurs when an object is deleted during normal operation yet the program neglects to update any of the associated memory pointers  potentially causing system instability when that location is referenced again  this is called dangling pointer  and the first known exploit for this particular problem was presented in july       before this publication the problem was known but considered to be academic and not practically exploitable       unfortunately  there is no theoretical model of  secure coding  practices  nor is one practically achievable  insofar as the code  ideally  read only  and data  generally read write  generally tends to have some form of defect     within computer systems  two security models capable of enforcing privilege separation are access control lists  acls  and capability based security  using acls to confine programs has been proven to be insecure in many situations  such as if the host computer can be tricked into indirectly allowing restricted file access  an issue known as the confused deputy problem  it has also been shown that the promise of acls of giving access to an object to only one person can never be guaranteed in practice  both of these problems are resolved by capabilities  this does not mean practical flaws exist in all acl based systems  but only that the designers of certain utilities must take responsibility to ensure that they do not introduce flaws citation needed    capabilities have been mostly restricted to research operating systems  while commercial oss still use acls  capabilities can  however  also be implemented at the language level  leading to a style of programming that is essentially a refinement of standard object oriented design  an open source project in the area is the e language     the most secure computers are those not connected to the internet and shielded from any interference  in the real world  the most secure systems are operating systems where security is not an add on     there has been a significant debate regarding the legality of hacking back against digital attackers  who attempt to or successfully breach an individual s  entity s  or nation s computer   the arguments for such counter attacks are based on notions of equity  active defense  vigilantism  and the computer fraud and abuse act  cfaa   the arguments against the practice are primarily based on the legal definitions of  intrusion  and  unauthorized access   as defined by the cfaa  as of october       the debate is ongoing       some illustrative examples of different types of computer security breaches are given below     in       only        computers were connected to the internet  and most were mainframes  minicomputers and professional workstations  on november          many started to slow down  because they were running a malicious code that demanded processor time and that spread itself to other computers   the first internet  computer worm     the software was traced back to    year old cornell university graduate student robert tappan morris  jr  who said  he wanted to count how many machines were connected to the internet        in       over a hundred intrusions were made by unidentified crackers into the rome laboratory  the us air force s main command and research facility  using trojan horses  hackers were able to obtain unrestricted access to rome s networking systems and remove traces of their activities  the intruders were able to obtain classified files  such as air tasking order systems data and furthermore able to penetrate connected networks of national aeronautics and space administration s goddard space flight center  wright patterson air force base  some defense contractors  and other private sector organizations  by posing as a trusted rome center user       in early       american apparel and home goods company tjx announced that it was the victim of an unauthorized computer systems intrusion   and that the hackers had accessed a system that stored data on credit card  debit card  check  and merchandise return transactions       the computer worm known as stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of iran s nuclear centrifuges   by disrupting industrial programmable logic controllers  plcs  in a targeted attack generally believed to have been launched by israel and the united states         although neither has publicly acknowledged this     in early       thousands of thousands of classified documents   were disclosed by nsa contractor edward snowden  called the  most significant leak in u s  history    it also revealed for the first time the massive breaches of computer security by the nsa  including deliberately inserting a backdoor in a nist standard for encryption   and tapping the links between google s data centres       in      and       a russian ukranian hacking ring known as  rescator  broke into target corporation computers in       stealing roughly    million credit cards    and then home depot computers in       stealing between    and    million credit card numbers    warnings were delivered at both corporations  but ignored  physical security breaches using self checkout machines are believed to have played a large role   the malware utilized is absolutely unsophisticated and uninteresting   says jim walter  director of threat intelligence operations at security technology company mcafee   meaning that the heists could have easily been stopped by existing antivirus software had administrators responded to the warnings  the size of the thefts has resulted in major attention from state and federal united states authorities and the investigation is ongoing     conflict of laws in cyberspace   has become a major cause of concern for computer security community  some of the main challenges and complaints about the antivirus industry are the lack of global web regulations  a global base of common rules to judge  and eventually punish  cyber crimes and cyber criminals  there is no global cyber law   and cyber security treaty   that can be invoked for enforcing global cyber security issues     international legal issues of cyber attacks   are really tricky and complicated in nature    for instance  even if an antivirus firm locates the cyber criminal behind the creation of a particular virus or piece of malware or again one form of cyber attack  often the local authorities cannot take action due to lack of laws under which to prosecute      this is mainly caused by the fact that many countries have their own regulations regarding cyber crimes  authorship attribution for cyber crimes and cyber attacks has become a major problem for international law enforcement agencies        computer viruses switch from one country to another  from one jurisdiction to another   moving around the world  using the fact that we don t have the capability to globally police operations like this  so the internet is as if someone had given free plane tickets to all the online criminals of the world      mikko hypp nen  use of dynamic dns  fast flux and bullet proof servers have added own complexities to this situation       businesses are eager to expand to less developed countries due to the low cost of labor  says white et al          however  these countries are the ones with the least amount of internet safety measures  and the internet service providers are not so focused on implementing those safety measures         instead  they are putting their main focus on expanding their business  which exposes them to an increase in criminal activity       in response to the growing problem of cyber crime  the european commission established the european cybercrime centre  ec      the ec  effectively opened on   january      and will be the focal point in the eu s fight against cyber crime  contributing to faster reaction to online crimes  it will support member states and the eu s institutions in building an operational and analytical capacity for investigations  as well as cooperation with international partners       the role of the government is to make regulations to force companies and organizations to protect their system  infrastructure and information from any cyber attacks  but also to protect its own national infrastructure such as the national power grid     the question of whether the government should intervene or not in the regulation of the cyberspace is a very polemical one  indeed  for as long as it has existed and by definition  the cyberspace is a virtual space free of any government intervention  where everyone agree that an improvement on cybersecurity is more than vital  is the government the best actor to solve this issue  many government officials and experts think that the government should step in and that there is a crucial need for regulation  mainly due to the failure of the private sector to solve efficiently the cybersecurity problem  r  clarke said during a panel discussion at the rsa security conference in san francisco  he believes that the  industry only responds when you threaten regulation  if industry doesn t respond  to the threat   you have to follow through     on the other hand  executives from the private sector agree that improvements are necessary but think that the government intervention would affect their ability to innovate efficiently     the cybersecurity act of      establishes the creation of an advisory
