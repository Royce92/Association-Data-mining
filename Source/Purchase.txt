 purchasing refers to a business or organization attempting to acquiring goods or services to accomplish the goals of its enterprise  though there are several organizations that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process  processes can vary greatly between organizations  typically the word  purchasing  is not used interchangeably with the word  procurement   since procurement typically includes expediting  supplier quality  and transportation and logistics  t l  in addition to purchasing             purchasing managers directors  and procurement managers directors guide the organization s acquisition procedures and standards  most organizations use a three way check as the foundation of their purchasing programs  this involves three departments in the organization completing separate parts of the acquisition process  the three departments do not all report to the same senior manager  to prevent unethical practices and lend credibility to the process  these departments can be purchasing  receiving and accounts payable  or engineering  purchasing and accounts payable  or a plant manager  purchasing and accounts payable  combinations can vary significantly  but a purchasing department and accounts payable are usually two of the three departments involved     when the receiving department is not involved  it is typically called a two way check or two way purchase order  in this situation  the purchasing department issues the purchase order receipt not required  when an invoice arrives against the order  the accounts payable department will then go directly to the requestor of the purchase order to verify that the goods or services were received  this is typically what is done for goods and services that will bypass the receiving department  a few examples are software delivered electronically  nre work  non reoccurring engineering services   consulting hours  etc     historically  the purchasing department issued purchase orders for supplies  services  equipment  and raw materials  then  in an effort to decrease the administrative costs associated with the repetitive ordering of basic consumable items   blanket  or  master  agreements were put into place  these types of agreements typically have a longer duration and increased scope to maximize the quantities of scale concept  when additional supplies were required  a simple release would be issued to the supplier to provide the goods or services     another method of decreasing administrative costs associated with repetitive contracts for common material  is the use of company credit cards  also known as  purchasing cards  or simply  p cards   p card programs vary  but all of them have internal checks and audits to ensure appropriate use  purchasing managers realized once contracts for the low dollar value consumables are in place  procurement can take a smaller role in the operation and use of the contracts  there is still oversight in the forms of audits and monthly statement reviews  but most of their time is now available to negotiate major purchases and setting up of other long term contracts  these contracts are typically renewable annually     this trend away from the daily procurement function  tactical purchasing  resulted in several changes in the industry  the first was the reduction of personnel  purchasing departments were now smaller  there was no need for the army of clerks processing orders for individual parts as in the past  another change was the focus on negotiating contracts and procurement of large capital equipment  both of these functions permitted purchasing departments to make the biggest financial contribution to the organization  a new terms and job title emerged   strategic sourcing and sourcing managers  these professionals not only focused on the bidding process and negotiating with suppliers  but the entire supply function  in these roles they were able to add value and maximize savings for organizations  this value was manifested in lower inventories  less personnel  and getting the end product to the organization s consumer quicker  purchasing manager s success in these roles resulted in new assignments outside to the traditional purchasing function   logistics  materials management  distribution  and warehousing  more and more purchasing managers were becoming supply chain managers handling additional functions of their organizations operation  purchasing managers were not the only ones to become supply chain managers  logistic managers  material managers  distribution managers  etc  all rose the broader function and some had responsibility for the purchasing functions now     in accounting  purchases is the amount of goods a company bought throughout this year  it also refers to information as to the kind  quality  quantity  and cost of goods bought that should be maintained  they are added to inventory  purchases are offset by purchase discounts and purchase returns and allowances  when it should be added depends on the free on board  fob  policy of the trade  for the purchaser  this new inventory is added on shipment if the policy was fob shipping point  and the seller remove this item from its inventory  on the other hand  the purchaser added this inventory on receipt if the policy was fob destination  and the seller remove this item from its inventory when it was delivered     goods bought for the purpose other than direct selling  such as for research and development  are added to inventory and allocated to research and development expense as they are used  on a side note  equipments bought for research and development are not added to inventory  but are capitalized as assets     the revised acquisition process for major systems in the u s  department of defense is shown in the next figure  the process is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts  which are subsequently developed and readied for production  after which the systems produced are supported in the field      the process allows for a given system to enter the process at any of the development phases  for example  a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation  while a system based on mature and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or  conceivably  even production  the process itself includes four phases of development      this is the process where the organization identifies potential suppliers for specified supplies  services or equipment  these suppliers  credentials and history are analyzed  together with the products or services they offer  the bidder selection process varies from organization to organization  but can include running credit reports  interviewing management  testing products  and touring facilities  this process is not always done in order of importance  but rather in order of expense  often purchasing managers research potential bidders obtaining information on the organizations and products from media sources and their own industry contacts  additionally  purchasing might send request for information  rfi  to potential suppliers to help gather information  engineering would also inspect sample products to determine if the company or organisation can produce products they need  if the bidder passes both of these stages engineering may decide to do some testing on the materials to further verify quality standards  these tests can be expensive and involve significant time of multiple technicians and engineers  engineering management must make this decision based on the cost of the products they are likely to procure  the importance of the bidders  product to production  and other factors  credit checks  interviewing management  touring plants as well as other steps could all be utilized if engineering  manufacturing  and supply chain managers decide they could help their decision and the cost is justifiable     other organizations might have minority procurement goals to consider in selection of bidders  organizations identify goals in the use of companies owned and operated by certain ethnicities or women owned business enterprises  significant utilizing of minority suppliers may qualify the firm as a potential bidder for a contract with a company or governmental entity looking to increase their minority supplier programs     this selection process can include or exclude international suppliers depending on organizational goals and criteria  companies looking to increase their pacific rim supplier base may exclude suppliers from the americas  europe  and australia  other organizations may be looking to purchase domestically to ensure a quicker response to orders as well as easier collaboration on design and production     organizational goals will dictate the criteria for the selection process of bidders  it is also possible that the product or service being procured is so specialized that the number of bidders are limited and the criteria must be very wide to permit competition  if only one firm can meet the specifications for the product then the purchasing managers must consider utilizing a  sole source  option or work with engineering to broaden the specifications if the project will permit alteration in the specifications  the sole source option is the part of the selection of bidders that acknowledges there is sometimes only one reasonable supplier for some services or products  this can be because of the limited applications for the product cannot support more than one manufacturer  proximity of the service provided  or the products are newly designed or invented and competition is not yet available     this is the process an organization utilizes to procure goods  services or equipment  processes vary significantly from the stringent to the very informal  large corporations and governmental entities are most likely to have stringent and formal processes  these processes can utilize specialized bid forms that require specific procedures and detail  the very stringent procedures require bids to be open by several staff from various departments to ensure fairness and impartiality  responses are usually very detailed  bidders not responding exactly as specified and following the published procedures can be disqualified  smaller private businesses are more likely to have less formal procedures  bids can be in the form of an email to all of the bidders specifying products or services  responses by bidders can be detailed or just the proposed dollar amount     most bid processes are multi tiered  acquisitions under a specified dollar amount can be  user discretion  permitting the request or to choose who ever they want  this level can be as low as      or as high as         depending on the organization  the rationale is the savings realized by processing these request the same as expensive items is minimal and does not justify the time and expense  purchasing departments watch for abuses of the user discretion privilege  acquisitions in a mid range can be processed with a slightly more formal process  this process may involve the user providing quotes from three separate suppliers  purchasing may be asked or required to obtain the quotes  the formal bid process starts as low as         or as high as          depending on the organization  the bid usually involves a specific form the bidder fills out and must be returned by a specified deadline  depending of the commodity being purchased and the organization the bid may specify a weighted evaluation criterion  other bids would be evaluated at the discretion of purchasing or the end users  some bids could be evaluated by a cross functional committee  other bids may be evaluated by the end user or the buyer in purchasing  especially in small  private firms the bidders could be evaluated on criteria or factors that have little if anything to do with the actual bid  examples of these factors are history of the bidder with the company  history of the bidder with the company s senior management at other firms  and bidder s breadth of products     technical evaluations  evaluations of the technical suitability of the quoted goods or services  if required  are normally performed prior to the commercial evaluation  during this phase of the procurement process  a technical representative of the company  usually an engineer  will review the proposal and designate each bidder as either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable     cost of money is calculated by multiplying the applicable currency interest rate by the amount of money paid prior to the receipt of the goods  if the money was to have remained in the buyer s account  interest would be drawn  that interest is essentially an additional cost associated with such progress or milestone payments     the manufacturing location is taken into consideration during the evaluation stage primarily to calculate for freight costs and regional issues  for instance  it is common in europe for factories to close during the month of august for a summer holiday  labor agreements may also be taken into consideration and may be drawn into the evaluation if the particular region is known to frequent labor unions     the manufacturing lead time is the time from the placement of the order  or time final drawings are submitted by the buyer to the seller  until the goods are manufactured and prepared for delivery  lead times vary by commodity and can range from several days to years     transportation time is evaluated while comparing the delivery of goods to the buyer s required use date  if goods are shipped from a remote port  with infrequent vessel transportation  the transportation time could exceed the schedule and adjustments would need to be made     delivery charges   the charge for the goods to be delivered to a stated point     negotiating is a key skillset in the purchasing field  one of the goals of purchasing agents is to acquire goods per the most advantageous terms of the buying entity  or simply  the  buyer    purchasing agents typically attempt to decrease costs while meeting the buyer s other requirements such as an on time delivery  compliance to the commercial terms and conditions  including the warranty  the transfer of risk  assignment  auditing rights  confidentiality  remedies  etc       good negotiators  those with high levels of documented  cost savings   receive a premium within the industry relative to their compensation  depending on the employment agreement between the purchasing agent  buyer  and the employer  buyer s cost savings can result in the creation of value to the business  and may result in a flat rate bonus  or a percentage payout to the purchasing agent of the documented cost savings     purchasing departments  while they can be considered as a support function of the key business  are actually revenue generating departments  for example  if the company needs to buy     million usd of widgets and the purchasing department secures the widgets for    m usd  the purchasing department would have saved the company   m usd  that savings could exceed the annual budget of the department  which in effect would pay the department s overhead   the employee s salaries  computers  office space  etc     post award administration typically consists of making minor changes  additions or subtractions  that in some way change the terms of the agreement or the seller s scope of supply  such changes are often minor  but for auditing purposes must be documented into the existing agreement  examples include increasing the quantity of a line item or changing the metallurgy of a particular component     is the closing of order
