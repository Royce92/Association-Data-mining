 a software system is a system of intercommunicating components based on software forming part of a computer system  a combination of hardware and software   it  consists of a number of separate programs  configuration files  which are used to set up these programs  system documentation  which describes the structure of the system  and user documentation  which explains how to use the system       while a computer program is a set of instructions  source  or object code  a software system has many more components such as specification  test results  end user documentation  maintenance records  etc              the term  software system  should be distinguished from the terms  computer program  and  software   the term computer program generally refers to a set of instructions  source  or object code  that perform a specific task  however  a software system generally refers to a more encompassing concept with many more components such as specification  test results  end user documentation  maintenance records  etc      the use of the term software system is at times related to the application of systems theory approaches in the context of software engineering  a software system consists of several separate computer programs and associated configuration files  documentation  etc   that operate together   the concept is used in the study of large and complex software  because it focuses on the major components of software and their interactions  it is also related to the field of software architecture     software systems are an active area of research for groups interested in software engineering in particular and systems engineering in general   academic journals like the journal of systems and software  published by elsevier  are dedicated to the subject      the acm software system award is an annual award that honors people or an organization  for developing a software system that has had a lasting influence  reflected in contributions to concepts  in commercial acceptance  or both    it has been awarded by the association for computing machinery  acm  since       with a cash prize sponsored by ibm     major categories of software systems include those based on application software  programming software and system software  although the distinction can sometimes be difficult  examples of software systems include operating systems  computer reservations systems  air traffic control systems  military command and control systems  telecommunication networks  content management systems  database management systems  expert systems  etc
