 adobe flash  formerly called macromedia flash and shockwave flash  is a multimedia and software platform used for creating vector graphics  animation  games and rich internet applications  rias  that can be viewed  played and executed in adobe flash player  flash is frequently used to serve streaming media  advertisement and interactive multimedia content on web pages and flash enabled software  however  in recent years  the usage of flash on websites has declined      flash manipulates vector and raster graphics to provide animation of text  drawings  and still images  it allows bidirectional streaming of audio and video  and it can capture mouse  keyboard  microphone and camera input  interactive flash animations are created using the object oriented language called actionscript  flash content can be developed using an ide such as adobe flash professional  adobe s attempt to foster open source flash development appears to have been abandoned citation needed    adobe flash player makes flash contents accessible on windows  os x and linux  some smartphones and tablets  and a few other electronic devices using flash lite  it is available free of charge for web browsers as a plug in  flash enabled computer programs can be created with the adobe air framework             flash originated with the application smartsketch  developed by jonathan gay  it was published by futurewave software  which was founded by charlie jackson  smartsketch was a drawing application for pen computers running the penpoint os    when penpoint failed in the marketplace  smartsketch was ported to microsoft windows and mac os  as the internet became more popular  futurewave added cell animation editing to the vector drawing capabilities of smartsketch and released futuresplash animator on multiple platforms   futurewave approached adobe systems with an offer to sell them futuresplash in       but adobe turned down the offer at that time  futuresplash was used by microsoft in its early work with the internet  msn   and also by disney online for their subscription based service disney s daily blast  in       futuresplash was acquired by macromedia and released as flash  flash is currently developed and distributed by adobe systems  as the result of its      purchase of macromedia     adobe flash professional is one of the common animation programs for low cost  d television and commercial animation  in competition with anime studio and toon boom animation  notable users of the software include dhx media vancouver for productions including pound puppies and my little pony  friendship is magic  fresh tv for total drama  nelvana for  teen and clone high  williams street for metalocalypse and squidbillies  and nickelodeon animation studios for wow  wow  wubbzy  el tigre  the adventures of manny rivera  danny phantom and happy tree friends  flash is less commonly used for feature length animated films  however       s the secret of kells  an irish film  was animated primarily in adobe flash  and was nominated for an academy award for best animated feature at the   nd academy awards     flash source files are in the fla format  and contain graphics  animation as well as embedded assets such as bitmap images  audio files and flv video files  the flash source file format is a proprietary format and adobe flash professional is the only available authoring tool capable of editing such files  flash source files   fla  may be compiled into flash movie files   swf  using flash professional     flash movie files are in the swf format  traditionally called  shockwave flash  movies   flash movies   or  flash applications   usually have a  swf file extension  and may be used in the form of a web page plug in  strictly  played  in a standalone flash player  or incorporated into a self executing projector movie  with the  exe extension in microsoft windows   flash video filesspec   have a  flv file extension and are either used from within  swf files or played through a flv aware player  such as vlc  or quicktime and windows media player with external codecs added     the use of vector graphics combined with program code allows flash files to be smaller and thus allows streams to use less bandwidth than the corresponding bitmaps or video clips  for content in a single format  such as just text  video  or audio   other alternatives may provide better performance and consume less cpu power than the corresponding flash movie  for example when using transparency or making large screen updates such as photographic or text fades     in addition to a vector rendering engine  the flash player includes a virtual machine called the actionscript virtual machine  avm  for scripting interactivity at run time  with video  mp  based audio  and bitmap graphics  as of flash player    it offers two video codecs  on  technologies vp  and sorenson spark  and run time jpeg  progressive jpeg  png  and gif capability  in the next version  flash is slated to use a just in time compiler for the actionscript engine     flash player    introduced a full  d shader api  called stage d  which is fairly similar to webgl       virtually all browser plugins for video are free of charge and cross platform  including adobe s offering of flash video  which was first introduced with flash version    flash video has been a popular choice for websites due to the large installed user base and programmability of flash  in       apple publicly criticized adobe flash  including its implementation of video playback for not taking advantage of hardware acceleration  one reason flash is not to be found on apple s mobile devices  soon after apple s criticism  adobe demoed and released a beta version of flash       which takes advantage of gpu hardware acceleration even on a mac  flash      beta  released december       adds hardware acceleration for the whole video rendering pipeline     flash audio is most commonly encoded in mp  or aac  advanced audio coding  however it can also use adpcm  nellymoser  nellymoser asao codec  and speex audio codecs  flash allows sample rates of        and     xa khz  it cannot have   xa khz audio sample rate  which is the standard tv and dvd sample rate     on august           adobe announced on its blog that with update   of flash player    flash video will also implement some parts of the mpeg   international standards   specifically  flash player will work with video compressed in h      mpeg   part      audio compressed using aac  mpeg   part     the f v  mp   mpeg   part      m v  m a   gp and mov multimedia container formats   gpp timed text specification  mpeg   part      which is a standardized subtitle format and partial parsing capability for the  ilst  atom  which is the id  equivalent itunes uses to store metadata  mpeg   part   and h     will not work in f v file format  adobe also announced that it will be gradually moving away from the flv format to the standard iso base media file format  mpeg   part     owing to functional limits with the flv structure when streaming h      the final release of the flash player implementing some parts of mpeg   standards had become available in fall           adobe flash player      does not have acoustic echo cancellation  unlike the voip offerings of skype and google voice  making this and earlier versions of flash less suitable for group calling or meetings  flash player      beta incorporates acoustic echo cancellation     actionscript is the programming language used by flash  it is an enhanced superset of the ecmascript programming language  with a classical java style class model  rather than javascript s prototype model     in october       macromedia disclosed the flash version   specification on its website  it did this in response to many new and often semi open formats competing with swf  such as xara s flare and sharp s extended vector animation formats  several developers quickly created a c library for producing swf  in february       morphink    was introduced  the first third party program to create swf files  macromedia also hired middlesoft to create a freely available developers  kit for the swf file format versions   to       macromedia made the flash files specifications for versions   and later available only under a non disclosure agreement  but they are widely available from various sites     in april       the flash swf file format specification was released with details on the then newest version format  flash     although still lacking specific information on the incorporated video compression formats  on   sorenson spark  etc    this new documentation covered all the new features offered in flash v  including new actionscript commands  expressive filter controls  and so on  the file format specification document is offered only to developers who agree to a license agreement that permits them to use the specifications only to develop programs that can export to the flash file format  the license does not allow the use of the specifications to create programs that can be used for playback of flash files  the flash   specification was made available under similar restrictions      in june       adobe launched the open screen project  adobe link   which made the swf specification available without restrictions  previously  developers could not use the specification for making swf compatible players  but only for making swf exporting authoring software  the specification still omits information on codecs such as sorenson spark  however       the adobe flash professional authoring program is primarily used to design graphics and animation and publish the same for websites  web applications  and video games  the program also offers limited support for audio and video embedding  and actionscript scripting     adobe provides four ways of developing software applications for flash     open source projects like ajax animator aim to create a flash development environment  complete with a graphical user environment  alternatively  programs such as vectorian giotto  swfmill  swftools  and mtasc provide tools to create swf files  but do so by compiling text  actionscript or xml files into flash animations  it is also possible to create swf files programmatically using the ming library  which has interfaces for c  php  c    perl  python  and ruby  haxe is an open source  high level object oriented programming language geared towards web content creation that can compile flash files     many shareware developers produced flash creation tools and sold them for under us    between      and       in      competition and the emergence of free flash creation tools had driven many third party flash creation tool makers out of the market  allowing the remaining developers to raise their prices  although many of the products still cost less than us     and work with actionscript  as for open source tools  ktoon can edit vectors and generate swf  but its interface is very different from macromedia s  another  more recent example of a flash creation tool is swish max made by an ex employee of macromedia  toon boom technologies also sells a traditional animation tool  based on flash     in addition  several programs create  swf compliant files as output from their programs  among the best known of these is screencast  which leverages the ability to do lossless compression and playback of captured screen content to produce demos  tutorials  or software simulations of programs  these programs are typically designed for use by non programmers  and create flash content quickly and easily  but cannot actually edit the underlying flash code  i e  the tweening and transforms  etc    screencam is perhaps the oldest screencasting authoring tool to adopt flash as the preferred output format  having been developed since the mid   s  the fact that screencasting programs have adopted flash as the preferred output is testament to flash s presence as a ubiquitous cross platform animation file format     other tools focus on creating specific types of flash content  goanimate is a cloud based platform for creating and distributing high quality animated videos  anime studio is a  d animation software package specialized for character animation that creates swf files  express animator is similarly aimed specifically at animators  question writer publishes its quizzes to flash file format     users who are not programmers or web designers will also find on line tools that allow them to build full flash based websites  one of the oldest services available        is flashtogo  such companies provide a wide variety of pre built models  templates  associated to a content management system that empowers users to easily build  edit and publish their websites  other sites  that allows greater customization and design flexibility are wix com and circlepad     adobe wrote a software package called adobe livemotion  designed to create interactive animation content and export it to a variety of formats  including swf  livemotion went through two major releases  but failed to gain any notable user base     in february       macromedia purchased presedia  which had developed a flash authoring tool that automatically converted powerpoint files into flash  macromedia subsequently released the new product as breeze  which included many new enhancements  in addition   as of version    apple s keynote presentation software also allows users to create interactive presentations and export to swf     since software applications can be built on adobe flash  third party development tools have been created to assist developers in doing so  flashdevelop is a free and open source flash actionscript ide  which includes a project manager and debugger for building applications on flash player and adobe air  powerflasher fdt is a commercial actionscript ide similar to flashdevelop         adobe flash player is a multimedia and application player originally developed by macromedia and acquired by adobe systems  it plays swf files  which can be created by adobe flash professional  apache flex  or a number of other adobe systems and  rd party tools  it has support for a scripting language called actionscript  which can be used to display flash video from an swf file     swfdec is an outdated free open source replacement of adobe flash player  it runs on linux and freebsd and is distributed under the terms of the gnu lesser general public license  lgpl     the last release was on decemberxa    xa     xa                  shumway is an open source flash player released by mozilla in november       it is built in javascript and is thus compatible with modern web browsers        in early october       shumway was included by default in the firefox nightly branch        gnash is an active project that aims to create a software player and browser plugin replacement for the adobe flash player  despite potential patent worries because of the proprietary nature of the files involved  gnash provides most swfv  features but does not fully support swf v   swf v  files  or the    th generation      gnash runs on windows  linux and other platforms for the    bit     bit  and other operating systems     lightspark is a free and open source swf player  it implements the latest actionscript    lightspark supports opengl based rendering for  d content  the player is compatible with h     flash videos on youtube     scaleform gfx is a commercial alternative flash player that features fully hardware accelerated  d graphics rendering using the gpu  scaleform has high conformance with both flash    actionscript     and flash   actionscript    scaleform gfx is a game development middleware solution that helps create graphical user interfaces or huds within  d video games     the reliance on adobe for decoding flash makes its use on the world wide web a concern for advocates of open standards and free software   the completeness of its public specifications are debated  and no complete implementation of flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse  generally  public specifications are what makes a format re implementable  see future proofing data storage   and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator     adobe s restrictions on the use of the swf flv specifications were lifted in february       see adobe s open screen project   however  despite efforts of projects like gnash  swfdec and lightspark  a complete free flash player is yet to be seen  as of september       for example  gnash cannot use swf v   yet    notably  gnash has been a long standing high priority project of the free software foundation since at least       and it was ranked number one in september            notable advocates of free software  open standards  and the world wide web have warned against the use of flash     founder of mozilla europe  tristan nitot stated in            companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich media technologies like adobe s flash and microsoft s silverlight        you re producing content for your users and there s someone in the middle deciding whether users should see your content     representing open standards  inventor of css and co author of html   h kon wium lie explained in a google tech talk of       entitled  the  video  element   the proposal of theora as the format for html  video       i believe very strongly  that we need to agree on some kind of baseline video format if the video element is going to succeed  flash is today the baseline format on the web  the problem with flash is that it s not an open standard     representing the free software movement  richard stallman stated in a speech in      that     the use of flash in websites is a major problem for our community      adobe flash player has been released for a variety of desktop operating systems  including windows  mac os x  and linux    in       adobe claimed that     of desktop pcs had flash player installed       as of may       users of computers with the powerpc processor are not able to view flash content from some sites  e g  facebook  that requires the latest upgrade of adobe flash player  which is not compatible with this processor architecture       in february       adobe announced the discontinuation of its npapi flash plugin for linux from version       newer versions will not be available from adobe  but integrated with google chrome  using its ppapi instead  security updates for the npapi version will still be provided for   years       since version    of adobe flash player  released october             bit and    bit builds for windows  mac and linux have been released in sync    previously  adobe offered experimental    bit builds of flash player for linux  from november              to june                adobe flash player has been released for a variety of mobile operating systems  including android  between versions       and           pocket pc windows ce  qnx  e g  on blackberry playbook   symbian  palm os  and webos  since version            flash player for smart phones was made available to handset manufacturers at the end of            adobe stops supporting flash player for mobile device browsers after the release of       it continues to support deploying flash based content as mobile applications via adobe air       in november       however  adobe announced the withdrawal of support for flash on mobile devices  adobe is reaffirming its commitment to  aggressively contribute  to html     in november      there were also a number of announcements that demonstrated a possible decline in demand for rich internet application architectures  and flash in particular    adobe announced the end of flash for mobile platforms or tv  instead focusing on html  for browser content and adobe air for the various mobile application stores        pundits questioned its continued relevance even on the desktop   and described it as  the beginning of the end     blackberry ltd  formerly known as rim  announced that it would continue to develop flash for the playbook       there is no adobe flash player for ios devices  iphone  ipad and ipod touch   however  flash content can be made to run on ios devices in a variety of ways     the mobile version of internet explorer for windows phone cannot play flash content     however flash support is still present on the tablet version of windows       adobe flash lite is a lightweight version of adobe flash player intended for mobile phones and other portable electronic devices like chumby and iriver     on the emerging single board enthusiast market  as substantially popularized by the raspberry pi  support from adobe is lacking  however  gnash have been ported and found useful       using flash tends to break conventions associated with normal html pages  selecting text  scrolling    form control and right clicking act differently from with a regular html webpage  many such interface unexpectancies are fixable by the designer  usability expert jakob nielsen published an alertbox in      entitled  flash      bad  which listed issues like these    some problems have been at least partially fixed since nielsen s complaints     flash player supports two distinct modes of video playback  and video decoding may not be used for older video content  such content causes excessive cpu usage compared to comparable content played with other players     in tests done by ars technica in      and       adobe flash player performed better on windows than mac os x and linux with the same hardware      performance has later improved for the latter two  on mac os x with flash player         and on linux with flash player          flash content is usually embedded using the object or embed html element    a web browser that does not fully implement one of these elements displays the replacement text  if supplied by the web page  often  a plugin is required for the browser to fully implement these elements  though some users cannot or will not install it     since flash can be used to produce content  such as advertisements  that some users find obnoxious or take a large amount of bandwidth to download  some web browsers default to not play flash content before the user clicks on it  e g  konqueror  k meleon     most current browsers have a feature to block plugins  playing one only when the user clicks it  opera versions since      feature native flash blocking  opera turbo requires the user to click to play flash content  and the browser also allows the user to enable this option permanently  both chrome   and firefox   have an option to enable  click to play plugins   equivalent  flash blocker  extensions are also available for many popular browsers  firefox has flashblock and noscript  internet explorer has foxie  which contains a number of features  one of them named flashblock  webkit based browsers under mac os x  such as apple s safari  have clicktoflash        adobe flash player      introduced a local settings manager that can be accessed from the microsoft windows control panel or the os x system preferences panel  this panel superseded the previous global online settings manager    the privacy settings panel allows users to specify whether websites must ask their permission before using the web camera or microphone    this was apparently part of a fix for vulnerabilities that enabled the use of flash for spying via web camera         intego s year in mac security   report states that in       the flashback trojan surfaced targeting mac os x users  which first masqueraded as a flash player installer  intego later recommended that adobe users get trusted updates  only directly from the vendor that publishes them        implementational vulnerabilities are flaws in the specific player software  rather than inherent to the flash format or its usage  in particular  this section s listing of flaws in adobe s flash player can not be expected to apply to other players  and vice versa     adobe flash player s security record   has caused several security experts to recommend against installing the player  or to block flash content      the us cert recommends to block flash using noscript    and charlie miller recommended  not to install flash    at the computer security conference cansecwest  as of february           adobe flash player has over     cve entries    of which over     lead to arbitrary code execution  security vulnerabilities in adobe flash player account for a third of all vulnerabilities reported in adobe products       security experts have predicted that with the rise of html   the flash plugin may become obsolete  the sophos security threat report      states that  fortunately  the need for browser plugins such as flash is diminishing     mcafee s report on      threats predictions concurs and predicts that threats will shift towards browsers       like the http cookie  a flash cookie  also known as a  local shared object   can be used to save application data  flash cookies are not shared across domains  an august      study by the ashkan soltani and a team of researchers at uc berkeley found that     of websites using flash were also employing flash cookies  yet privacy policies rarely disclosed them  and user controls for privacy preferences were lacking    most browsers  cache and history suppress or delete functions did not affect flash player s writing local shared objects to its own cache in version      and earlier  at which point the user community was much less aware of the existence and function of flash cookies than http cookies    thus  users with those versions  having deleted http cookies and purged browser history files and caches  may believe that they have purged all tracking data from their computers when in fact flash browsing history remains  adobe s own flash website storage settings panel  a submenu of adobe s flash settings manager web application  and other editors and toolkits can manage settings for and delete flash local shared objects       on windows systems  lsos are stored in the directory    appdata macromediaflash player  deleting the contents of this directory should remove the lsos  flash cookies  for the current user     html  is often cited as an alternative to adobe flash technology usage on web pages  adobe released a tool that converts flash to html     and in june       google released an experimental tool that does the same      as of january       youtube will default to html  players to better support more devices       commercial software packages that can create swf files include toon boom  xara photo   graphic designer  vectorian giotto  celaction d  toufee  koolmoves  express animator  alligator flash designer  amara web and anime studio  these applications provide additional capabilities for creating cartoons  especially with tools more tailored to traditionally trained animators  as well as additional rigging for characters  which can speed up character animation considerably  additionally  there are programs available which translate  d information into  d vectors for display in flash player     several third party tools are able to use and generate swf files  and some tools such as irfanview are capable of rendering swf files  through the use of flash player  flash player cannot ship as part of a pure open source  or completely free operating system  as its distribution is bound to the macromedia licensing program and subject to proposition first from adobe citation needed there is no complete free and open source software replacement which offers all the functionality of the latest version of adobe flash player    and although commercial alternatives such as scaleform gfx do exist  they cannot work within web browsers     open source flash content creation software includes ajax animator  clash  openoffice impress  ktoon  salasaga  and synfig     apache flex is an open source software development kit  sdk  for the development of flash based rich internet applications  the apache flex actionscript     compiler generates swf files from actionscript   files  flex was the primary actionscript   compiler and was actively developed by adobe before it was donated to apache software foundation in          haxe is an open source programming language and compiler  that is able to generate swf files from haxe programs  as of       haxe can build programs for flash player that perform faster than the same application built with the adobe flex sdk compiler  due to additional compiler optimizations supported in haxe   unreliable source     swfc is an open source actionscript     compiler which generates swf files from script files  which includes svg tags  it is currently the most complete alternative for building flash content in linux  despite being entirely script based and not having a gui     the ming library is able to import and export graphics from xml into swf  ming has bindings for popular scripting languages such as php and python     the flash   linux project was an initiative to develop an open source linux application as an alternative to adobe flash professional  development plans included authoring capacity for  d animation  and tweening  as well as outputing swf file formats  f l evolved into an editor that was capable of authoring  d animation and publishing of swf files  flash   linux was renamed uira  uira intended to combine the resources and knowledge of the f l project and the qflash project  both of which were open source applications that aimed to provide an alternative to the proprietary adobe flash     uira was free software  but was never truly completed  it reached a stage of being no more than a shell of a ui with limited functionality  due in part to the adoption of the dadvsi law in france  the uira project was shut down in january       according to the project s page in sourceforge citation needed    on may          adobe announced the open screen project  with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers  mobile devices  and consumer electronics    when the project was announced  seven goals were outlined  the abolition of licensing fees for adobe flash player and adobe integrated runtime  the removal of restrictions on the use of the shockwave flash  swf  and flash video  flv  file formats  the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting flash to new devices  and the publishing of the flash cast protocol and action message format  amf   which let flash applications receive information from remote databases       as of february     update  the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of swf and flv f v specs have been published    the flash cast protocol now known as the mobile content delivery protocol and amf protocols have also been made available    with amf available as an open source implementation  blazeds  work on the device porting layers is in the early stages  adobe intends to remove the licensing fees for flash player and adobe integrated runtime  air  for devices at their release for the open screen project     the list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes palm  motorola  and nokia    who  together with adobe  have announced a     million open screen project fund       as of     update  the open screen project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner bsquare  however paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use adobe software
