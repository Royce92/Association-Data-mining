 e science  or escience  is computationally intensive science that is carried out in highly distributed network environments  or science that uses immense data sets that require grid computing  the term sometimes includes technologies that enable distributed collaboration  such as the access grid  the term was created by john taylor  the director general of the united kingdom s office of science and technology in      and was used to describe a large funding initiative starting in november       e science has been more broadly interpreted since then  as  the application of computer technology to the undertaking of modern scientific investigation  including the preparation  experimentation  data collection  results dissemination  and long term storage and accessibility of all materials generated through the scientific process  these may include data modeling and analysis  electronic digitized laboratory notebooks  raw and fitted data sets  manuscript production and draft versions  pre prints  and print and or electronic publications    in       ieee escience conference series condensed the definition to  escience promotes innovation in collaborative  computationally  or data intensive research across all disciplines  throughout the research lifecycle  in one of the working definitions used by the organizers      these ideas were reflected by the many considerations for the preservation and access to the results of federally funded scientific research by the white house s office and science technology policy in february       in which some but not all of the aforementioned e science output products were slated for preservation and access requirements under the memorandum s directive   e sciences include particle physics  earth sciences and social simulations  particle physics has a well developed e science infrastructure in particular because of its need for adequate computing facilities for the analysis of results and storage of data originating from the cern large hadron collider  which started taking data in       e science encompasses  what is often referred to as  big data  which has revolutionized science   as of       the large hadron collider  lhc  at cern   generates around     terabytes per year  and the sloan digital sky survey   recently released    terabytes    and other highly data intensive modern fields of science   that generate large amounts of e science data include  computational biology  bioinformatics  and genomics               most of the research activities into e science have focused on the development of new computational tools and infrastructures to support scientific discovery  due to the complexity of the software and the backend infrastructural requirements  e science projects usually involve large teams managed and developed by research laboratories  large universities or governments  currentlywhen  there is a large focus in e science in the united kingdom  where the uk e science programme provides significant funding  in europe the development of computing capabilities to support the cern large hadron collider has led to the development of e science and grid infrastructures which are also used by other disciplines     example e science infrastructures include the worldwide lhc computing grid  a federation with various partners including the european grid infrastructure  the open science grid and the nordic datagrid facility     to support e science applications  open science grid combines interfaces to more than     nation wide clusters     interfaces to geographically distributed storage caches  and   campus grids  purdue  wisconsin madison  clemson  nebraska lincoln  fermigrid at fnal  suny buffalo  and oklahoma in the united states  and unesp in brazil   areas of science benefiting from open science grid include     after his appointment as director general of the research councils in      john taylor  with the support of the science minister david sainsbury and the chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown  bid to hm treasury to fund a programme of e infrastructure development for science which would provide the foundation for uk science and industry to be a world leader in the knowledge economy which motivated the lisbon strategy for sustainable economic growth that the uk government committed to in march          in november      john taylor announced     million for a national uk e science programme  an additional     million contribution was planned from uk industry in matching funds to projects that they participated in  from this budget of      million over three years      million was to be spent on grid application pilots in all areas of science  administered by the research council responsible for each area  while     million was to be administered by the epsrc as a core programme to develop  industrial strength  grid middleware  phase   of the programme for           was supported by a further     million for application projects  and     million for the epsrc core programme  phase   of the programme for           was supported by a further     million for the epsrc core programme and a further sum for applications  additional funding for uk e science activities was provided from european union funding  from university funding council srif funding for hardware  and from jisc for networking and other infrastructure     the uk e science programme comprised a wide range of resources  centres and people including the national e science centre  nesc  which is managed by the universities of glasgow and edinburgh  with facilities in both cities   tony hey led the core programme from      to           within the uk regional e science centres support their local universities and projects  including     there are also various centres of excellence and research centres     in addition to centres  the grid application pilot projects were funded by the research council responsible for each area of uk science funding     the epsrc funded    pilot e science projects in three phases  for about    million each in the first phase      the pparc stfc funded two projects  gridpp  phase   for     million  phase   for      million  phase   for     million and a  th phase running from      to       and astrogrid      million over   phases      the remaining     million of phase one funding was divided between the application projects funded by bbsrc  mrc and nerc     the funded uk e science programme was reviewed on its completion in      by an international panel led by daniel atkins  director of the office of cyberinfrastructure of the us nsf  the report concluded that the programme had developed a skilled pool of expertise  some services  and had led to cooperation between academia and industry  but that these achievements were at a project level rather than by generating infrastructure or transforming disciplines to adopt e science as a normal method of work  and that they were not self sustainable without further investment     us based initiatives  where the term cyberinfrastructure is typically used to define e science projects  are primarily funded by the national science foundation office of cyberinfrastructure  nsf oci   and department of energy  in particular the office of science      dutch escience research is coordinated by the netherlands escience center in amsterdam  an initiative founded by nwo and surf     plan e is a platform of national e science data research centers in europe  as established during the constituting meeting       october      in amsterdam  the netherlands  and which is based on agreed terms of reference  plan e has a kernel group of active members and convenes twice annually  more can be found on plan e     traditional science is representative of two distinct philosophical traditions within the history of science  but e science  it is being argued  requires a paradigm shift  and the addition of a third branch of the sciences   the idea of open data is not a new one  indeed  when studying the history and philosophy of science  robert boyle is credited with stressing the concepts of skepticism  transparency  and reproducibility for independent verification in scholarly publishing in the     s  the scientific method later was divided into two major branches  deductive and empirical approaches  today  a theoretical revision in the scientific method should include a new branch  victoria stodden advocates  that of the computational approach  where like the other two methods  all of the computational steps by which scientists draw conclusions are revealed  this is because within the last    years  people have been grappling with how to handle changes in high performance computing and simulation    conceptually  e science revolves around developing new methods to support scientists in conducting scientific research with the aim of making new scientific discoveries by analyzing vast amounts of data accessible over the internet using vast amounts of computational resources  however  discoveries of value cannot be made simply by providing computational tools  a cyberinfrastructure or by performing a pre defined set of steps to produce a result  rather  there needs to be an original  creative aspect to the activity that by its nature cannot be automated  this has led to various research that attempts to define the properties that e science platforms should provide in order to support a new paradigm of doing science  and new rules to fulfill the requirements of preserving and making computational data results available in a manner such that they are reproducible in traceable  logical steps  as an intrinsic requirement for the maintenance of modern scientific integrity that allows an extenuation of  boyle s tradition in the computational age       one view   argues that since a modern discovery process instance serves a similar purpose to a mathematical proof it should have similar properties  namely it allows results to be deterministically reproduced when re executed and that intermediate results can be viewed to aid examination and comprehension  in this case  simply modelling the provenance of data is not sufficient  one has to model the provenance of the hypotheses and results generated from analyzing the data as well so as to provide evidence that support new discoveries scientific workflows have thus been proposed and developed to assist scientists to track the evolution of their data  intermediate results and final results as a means to document and track the evolution of discoveries within a piece of scientific research     other views include science     where e science is considered to be a shift from the publication of final results by well defined collaborative groups towards a more open approach  which includes the public sharing of raw data  preliminary experimental results  and related information  to facilitate this shift  the science     view is on providing tools that simplify communication  cooperation and collaboration between interested parties  such an approach has the potential to  speed up the process of scientific discovery  overcome problems associated with academic publishing and peer review  and remove time and cost barriers  limiting the process of generating new knowledge
