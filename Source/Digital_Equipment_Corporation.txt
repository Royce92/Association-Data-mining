 digital equipment corporation  also known as dec  and using the trademark digital  was a major american company in the computer industry from the     s to the     s  it was a leading vendor of computer systems  including computers  software  and peripherals  and its pdp and successor vax products were the most successful of all minicomputers in terms of sales     from      until      its headquarters were located in a former wool mill in maynard  massachusetts  since renamed clock tower place and now home to multiple companies  dec was acquired in june      by compaq  which subsequently merged with hewlett packard in may       some parts of dec  notably the compiler business and the hudson  massachusetts facility  were sold to intel     digital equipment corporation should not be confused with the unrelated companies digital research  inc or western digital  although the latter manufactured the lsi    chipsets used in dec s low end pdp       computers             initially focusing on the small end of the computer market allowed dec to grow without its potential competitors making serious efforts to compete with them  their pdp series of machines became popular in the     s  especially the pdp    widely considered to be the first successful minicomputer  looking to simplify and update their line  dec replaced most of their smaller machines with the pdp    in       eventually selling over         units and cementing decs position in the industry  originally designed as a follow on to the pdp     dec s vax    series was the first widely used    bit minicomputer  sometimes referred to as  superminis   these were able to compete in many roles with larger mainframe computers  such as the ibm system      the vax was a best seller  with over         sold  and its sales through the     s propelled the company into the second largest in the industry  at its peak  dec was the second largest employer in massachusetts  second only to the state government     the rapid rise of the business microcomputer in the late     s  and especially the introduction of powerful    bit systems in the     s  quickly eroded the value of dec s systems  dec s last major attempt to find a space in the rapidly changing market was the dec alpha    bit risc processor architecture  dec initially started work on alpha as a way to re implement their vax series  but also employed it in a range of high performance workstations  although the alpha processor family met both of these goals  and  for most of its lifetime  was the fastest processor family on the market  extremely high asking prices betterxa sourcexa needed were outsold by lower priced x   chips from intel and clones such as amd     the company was acquired in june      by compaq  in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry  at the time  compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors  dec was a major player overseas where compaq had less presence  however  compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions  and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own  the company subsequently merged with hewlett packard in may       as of     update some of dec s product lines were still produced under the hp name     ken olsen and harlan anderson were two engineers who had been working at mit lincoln laboratory on the lab s various computer projects  the lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as  interactivity   and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real time  these had started in      with the famed whirlwind which was originally developed to make a flight simulator for the us navy  although this was never completed   instead  this effort evolved into the sage system for the us air force  which used large screens and light guns to allow operators to interact with radar data stored in the computer      when the air force project wound down  the lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the whirlwind using transistors in place of vacuum tubes  in order to test their new circuitry  they first built a small    bit machine known as tx   which first ran in        when the tx   successfully proved the basic concepts  attention turned to a much larger system  the    bit tx   with a then enormous    kwords of core memory  core was so expensive that parts of tx   s memory were stripped for the tx    and what remained of the tx   was then given to mit on permanent loan      at mit  olsen and anderson noticed something odd  students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped down tx    while largely ignoring a faster ibm machine that was also available  the two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role  essentially a commercialized tx    they could sell this to users where graphical output or realtime operation would be more important than outright performance  additionally  as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available  it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower cost solution dedicated to a specific task  where a larger    bit machine would not be needed      in      when the pair and ken s brother stan went looking for capital  they found that the american business community was hostile to investing in computer companies  many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the     s  wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete  and even large companies like rca and general electric were failing to make a profit in the market  the only serious expression of interest came from georges doriot and his american research and development corporation  ar d   worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing  doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers  and even change their name from  digital computer corporation       the pair returned with an updated business plan that outlined two phases for the company s development  they would start by selling computer modules as stand alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use  then  if these  digital modules  were able to build a self sustaining business  the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in their phase ii   the newly christened  digital equipment corporation  received         from ar d for a     share of the company   and began operations in a civil war era textile mill in maynard  massachusetts  where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available     in early      dec shipped its first products  the  digital laboratory module  line  the modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and germanium transistors mounted to a circuit board  the actual circuits being based on those from the tx        the laboratory modules were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing    intended to sit on an engineer s workbench  although a rack mount bay was sold that held   laboratory modules    they were then connected together using banana plug patch cords inserted at the front of the modules  three versions were offered  running at  xa mhz            xa khz         or   xa mhz           the modules proved to be in high demand in other computer companies  who used them to build equipment to test their own systems  despite the recession of the late     s  the company sold         worth of these modules during      alone  turning a profit at the end of its first year      the original laboratory modules were soon supplemented with the  digital systems module  line  which were identical internally but packaged differently  the systems modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using    pin amphenol connectors  and were attached to each other by plugging them into a backplane that could be mounted in a    inch rack  the backplanes allowed    modules in a single      xa inch section of rack  and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer      the original laboratory and system module lines were offered in     kilocycle    megacycle and    megacycle versions  in all cases  the supply voltages were     and     volts  with logic levels of    volts  passive pull down  and   volts  active pull up        dec used the systems modules to build their  memory test  machine for testing core memory systems  selling about    of these pre packaged units over the next eight years    the pdp   and linc computers were also built using systems modules  see below      modules were part of dec s product line into the     s  although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed  the same circuits were then packaged as the first  r   red  series  flip chip  modules  later  other module series provided additional speed  much higher logic density  and industrial i o capabilities    digital published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular     with the company established and a successful product on the market  dec turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned  phase ii    in august       ben gurley started design of the company s first computer  the pdp    in keeping with doriot s instructions  the name was an initialism for  programmable data processor   leaving off the term  computer   as gurley put it   we aren t building computers  we re building  programmable data processors    the prototype was first shown publicly at the joint computer conference in boston in december         the first pdp   was delivered to bolt  beranek and newman in november         and formally accepted the next april    the pdp   sold in basic form for           or about          in      us dollars    by the time production ended in          pdp  s had been delivered         the pdp   was supplied standard with      words of core memory     bits per word  and ran at a basic speed of         operations per second  it was constructed using many system building blocks that were packaged into several    inch racks  the racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case  with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lay at table top height at one end of the mainframe  above the control panel was the system s standard input output solution  a punch tape reader and writer  most systems were purchased with two peripherals  the type    vector graphics display  and a soroban engineering modified ibm model b electric typewriter that was used as a printer  the soroban system was notoriously unreliable  and often replaced with a modified friden flexowriter  which also contained its own punch tape system  a variety of more expensive add ons followed  including magnetic tape systems  punched card readers and punches  and faster punch tape and printer systems     when dec introduced the pdp    they also mentioned larger machines at        and    bits  based on the same design    during construction of the prototype pdp    some design work was carried out on a    bit pdp    and the    bit pdp    although the pdp   never proceeded beyond the initial design  the pdp   found some interest and was designed in full    only one pdp   appears to have been built  in       by the cia s scientific engineering institute  sei  in waltham  massachusetts  according to the limited information available  they used it to process radar cross section data for the lockheed a    reconnaissance aircraft  gordon bell remembered that it was being used in oregon some time later  but could not recall who was using it       in november      dec introduced the         pdp    the pdp   was similar to the pdp   and used a similar instruction set  but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price  like the pdp    about    pdp   s were eventually sold  most to a customer base similar to the original pdp         in      dec introduced its new flip chip module design  and used it to re implement the pdp   as the pdp    the pdp   was introduced in december       and about     were eventually produced    an upgrade to the flip chip led to the r series  which in turn led to the pdp  a in         the pdp   is most famous as the original machine for the unix operating system    and until the interdata      unix only ran on dec systems       a more dramatic upgrade to the pdp   series was introduced in august       the pdp      the pdp   was instruction compatible with the pdp   and     but ran about twice as fast as the    and was intended to be used in larger deployments  at only         in         the pdp   was a big seller  eventually selling     machines  more than all of the earlier models combined       even while the pdp   was being introduced  its replacement was being designed  and was introduced as      s pdp     which re implemented the pdp   using integrated circuits in place of modules  much faster than the pdp   even in basic form  the pdp    also included a floating point unit and a separate input output processor for further performance gains  over     pdp    s were ordered in the first eight months of production  and production eventually amounted to     examples in    basic models    however  by this time other machines in dec s lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points  and the pdp    would be the last of the    bit series     in       lincoln laboratory used a selection of system building blocks to implement a small    bit machine  and attached it to a variety of analog to digital  a to d  input output  i o  devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment  the linc proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community  and has since been referred to as the first real minicomputer    a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab     seeing the success of the linc  in      dec took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive a to d systems to produce the pdp    the new machine  the first outside the pdp   mould  was introduced at westcon on    august       a      ad expressed the main advantage of the pdp     now you can own the pdp   computer for what a core memory alone used to cost                 pdp  s were produced until the lines were shut down in early       like the pdp   before it  the pdp   inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent     on    march       dec introduced the pdp    which replaced the pdp   s modules with the new r series modules using flip chips  the machine was re packaged into a small tabletop case  which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the cpu which allowed one to easily see the wire wrapped internals of the cpu  sold standard with   kwords of    bit core memory and a teletype model    asr for basic input output  the machine listed for only          the pdp   is referred to as the first real minicomputer because of its sub         price      sales were  unsurprisingly  very strong  and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the pdp   s market space  which the pdp   trounced  this gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership    and eventually       straight eight  machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design       dec hit an even lower price point with the pdp   s  the s for  serial   as the name implies the  s used a serial arithmetic unit  which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under            dec then used the new pdp   design as the basis for a new linc  the two processor linc    the linc   used one pdp   cpu and a separate linc cpu  and included instructions to switch from one to the other  this allowed customers to run their existing linc programs  or  upgrade  to the pdp    all in software  although not a huge seller      linc  s were sold starting at            like the original linc to pdp   evolution  the linc   was then modified into the single processor pdp     adding another      machines to the    bit family      newer circuitry designs led to the pdp   i and pdp   l in         in       one year after an agreement between digital and intersil  the intersil      chip was launched  effectively a pdp   on a chip  this was a way to allow pdp   software to be run even after the official end of life announcement for the digital pdp   product line     while the pdp   introduced a lower cost line       s pdp   was intended to take dec into the mainframe market with a    bit machine  however  the pdp   proved to be a  hard sell  with customers  as it offered few advantages over similar machines from the better established vendors like ibm or honeywell  in spite of its low cost around           only    were sold    or    depending on the source    and unlike earlier models the low sales meant the pdp   was not improved with intermediate versions  however  the pdp   is historically important as the platform that introduced  monitor   an early time sharing operating system that would evolve into the widely used tops          in spite of the pdp   s limited commercial success  it introduced many features that clearly had commercial benefit  when the flip chip packaging allowed the pdp   to be re implemented at a much lower cost  dec took the opportunity to carry out a similar evolution of their    bit design and introduced the pdp    in       the pdp    was as much a success as the pdp   was a failure  during its lifetime about     mainframe pdp   s were sold before production ended in         the pdp    was widely used in university settings  and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the     s  dec later re branded all of the models in the    bit series as the  decsystem      and pdp   s are generally referred to by the model of their cpu  like  ka     soon upgraded to the  ki     i integrated circuits version   then to  kl     l large scale integration   ecl logics version   also the  ks     s  semiconductor version   later  unified the product lines upgrades produced the compatible decsystem     along with tops    that included virtual memory  the jupiter project was supposed to continue the mainframe product line into the future by using  gate arrays  with the innovating air mover cooling system  coupled with built in floating point processing engine called  fbox   delivering a top notch scientific computing niche  yet the critical performance measurement was based upon cobol compilation which did not fully utilize the primary design features of  jupiter   though  jupiter project  failed  the engineers immediately adapted the    bits design into    bits design and seamlessly came out as vax     released in          one of the most unusual peripherals produced for the pdp    was the dectape  the dectape was a length of special     inch wide magnetic tape wound on   inch reels  the recording format was a    track approach using fixed length numbered  blocks  organized into a standard file structure  including a directory  files could be written  read  changed  and deleted on a dectape as though it were a disk drive  for greater efficiency  the dectape drive could read and write to a dectape in both directions     in fact  some pdp    systems had no disks at all  using dectapes alone for their primary data storage  the dectape was also widely used on other pdp models  since it was much easier to use than hand loading multiple paper tapes  primitive early time sharing systems could use dectapes as system devices and swapping devices  although superior to paper tape  dectapes were relatively slow  and were supplanted as reliable disk drives became affordable     the pdp       bit computer was designed in a crash program by harold mcfarland  gordon bell  roger cady  and others    the project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of harold mcfarland  who had been researching    bit designs at carnegie mellon university  one of his simpler designs became the pdp     although when they first viewed the proposal  management was not impressed and almost cancelled it       in particular  the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory  a technique that was widely used on other dec machines and cisc designs in general  this would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory  which would slow it down  however  the machine also extended the idea of multiple  general purpose registers   gprs   which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high speed memory caches as they needed  potentially addressing the performance issues     a major advance in the pdp    design was digital s unibus  which supported all peripherals through memory mapping  this allowed a new device to be added easily  generally only requiring plugging a hardware interface board into the backplane and possibly adding a jumper to the wire wrapped backplane  and then installing software that read and wrote to the mapped memory to control it  the relative ease of interfacing spawned a huge market of third party add ons for the pdp     which made the machine even more useful     the combination of architectural innovations proved superior to competitors and the      architecture was soon the industry leader  propelling dec back to a strong market position  the design was later expanded to allow paged physical memory and memory protection features  useful for multitasking and time sharing  some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of     kb within a physical address size of up to   mb  smaller pdp   s  implemented as single chip cpus  continued to be produced until       by which time over         had been sold       the pdp    supported several operating systems  including bell labs  new unix operating system as well as dec s dos     rsx     ias  rt     dsm     and rsts e  many early pdp    applications were developed using standalone paper tape utilities  dos    was the pdp    s first disk operating system  but was soon supplanted by more capable systems  rsx provided a general purpose multitasking environment and supported a wide variety of programming languages  ias was a time sharing version of rsx   d  both rsts and unix were time sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost  and these pdp    systems were destined to be the  sandbox  for a rising generation of engineers and computer scientists  large numbers of pdp      s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications  at t corporation became dec s largest customer     rt    provided a practical real time operating system in minimal memory  allowing the pdp    to continue digital s critical role as a computer supplier for embedded systems  historically  rt    also served as the inspiration for many microcomputer os s  as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many pdp    models  for example  cp m used a command syntax similar to rt    s  and even retained the awkward pip program used to copy data from one computer device to another  as another historical footnote  dec s use of     for  switches   command line options  would lead to the adoption of    for pathnames in ms dos and microsoft windows as opposed to     in unix       the evolution of the pdp    followed earlier systems  eventually including a single user deskside personal computer form  the micropdp     in total  around         pdp   s of all models were sold  and a wide variety of third party peripheral vendors had also entered the computer product ecosystem     in       dec decided to extend the pdp    architecture to    bits while adding a complete virtual memory system to the simple paging and memory protection of the pdp     the result was the vax architecture  where vax stands for virtual address extension  from    to    bits   the first computer to use a vax cpu was the vax         which dec referred to as a superminicomputer  although it was not the first    bit minicomputer  the vax        s combination of features  price  and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in       vax systems were so successful that in       dec canceled its jupiter project  which had been intended to build a successor to the pdp    mainframe  and instead focused on promoting the vax as the single computer architecture for the company       supporting the vax s success was the vt    one of the most successful smart terminals  building on earlier less successful models  the vt   and vt     the vt   was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single chassis  the vt   was followed by the even more successful vt    and its follow ons  making dec one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry  with the vt series  dec could now offer a complete top to bottom system from computer to all peripherals  which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers     the vax processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the     s  culminating in the nvax microprocessor implementation and vax            series in the early     s       when a dec research group demonstrated two prototype microcomputers in      before the debut of the mits altair olsen chose to not proceed with the project  the company similarly rejected another personal computer proposal in         at the time these systems were of limited utility  and olsen famously derided them in       stating  there is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home     unsurprisingly  dec did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market  interestingly in       the heathkit h   was announced  a pdp    in kit form  at the beginning of the     s  dec built the vt     codenamed  robin    which was a vt    terminal with an added z   based microcomputer running cp m  but this product was initially available only to dec employees       it was only after ibm had successfully launched the ibm pc in      that dec responded with their own systems  in       digital introduced not one  but three incompatible machines which were each tied to different proprietary architectures  the first  the dec professional  was based on the pdp        and later  the        running the rsx   m  derived  but menu driven  p os   professional operating system    this dec machine easily outperformed the pc  but was more expensive than  and completely incompatible with ibm pc hardware and software  offering far fewer options for customizing a system     unlike cp m and dos microcomputers  every copy of every program for the professional had to be provided with a unique key for the particular machine and cpu for which it was bought  at that time this was mainstream policy  because most computer software was either bought from the company that built the computer or custom constructed for one client  however  the emerging third party software industry disregarded the pdp    professional line and concentrated on other microcomputers where distribution was easier  at dec itself  creating better programs for the professional was not a priority  perhaps from fear of cannibalizing the pdp    line  as a result the professional was a superior machine  running inferior software    in addition  a new user would have to learn an awkward  slow  and inflexible menu based user interface which appeared to be radically different from pc dos or cp m  which were more commonly used on the      and      based microcomputers of the time  a second offering  the decmate ii was the latest version of the pdp   based word processors  but not really suited to general computing  nor competitive with wang laboratories  popular word processing equipment     the most popular early dec microcomputer was the dual processor  z   and       rainbow        which ran the   bit cp m operating system on the z   and the    bit cp m    operating system on the intel      processor  it could also run a unix system iii implementation called venix  applications from standard cp m could be re compiled for the rainbow  but by this time users were expecting custom built  pre compiled binary  applications such as lotus        which was eventually ported along with ms dos     and introduced in late       although the rainbow generated some press  it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support    by late      ibm was outselling dec s personal computers by more than ten to one       the way the dec standard rx     floppy disk drive supported dec s initial offerings seemed to encapsulate their approach to the personal computer market  although the mechanical drive hardware was nearly identical to other     floppy disk drives available on competing systems    dec sought to differentiate their product by using a proprietary disk format for the data written on the disk  the dec format had a higher capacity for data  but the rx   drives were incompatible with other pc floppy drives  this required dec owners to buy higher priced  specially formatted floppy media  which was harder to obtain through standard distribution channels  dec attempted to enforce exclusive control over its floppy media sales by copyrighting its proprietary disk format  and requiring a negotiated license agreement and royalty payments from anybody selling compatible media  the proprietary data format meant that rx   floppies were not interchangeable with other pc floppies  further isolating dec products from the developing de facto standard pc market  hardware hackers and dec enthusiasts eventually reverse engineered the rx   format      but the damage had already been done  in terms of market confusion and isolation     a further system was introduced in      as the vaxmate  which included microsoft windows     and used vax vms based file and print servers along with integration into dec s own decnet family  providing lan wan connection from pc to mainframe or supermini  the vaxmate replaced the rainbow  and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation     in       dec launched its first    mbit s ethernet  ethernet allowed scalable networking  and vaxcluster allowed scalable computing  combined with decnet and ethernet based terminal servers  lat   dec had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with ibm  ethernet replaced token ring  and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today     in september       dec became the fifth company to register a  com domain name  dec com      along with the hardware and protocols  dec also introduced the vaxcluster concept  which allowed several vax machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system  vaxclusters allowed a dec based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time  as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one  the flexibility this offered was compelling  and allowed dec to attack high end markets formerly out of their reach     although their microcomputer efforts were eventually considered failures  the pdp    and vax lines continued to sell in record numbers  better yet  dec was competing very well against the market leader  ibm  taking an estimated   xa billion away from them in the mid   s  in       digital s profits rose    percent when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn  and by      the company was threatening ibm s number one position in the computer industry      at its peak  digital was the second largest computer company in the world  with over         employees  it was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment  the company invested heavily in custom software  in the     s and earlier most software was custom written to serve a specific task  but by the     s the introduction of relational databases and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion  potentially saving enormous amounts of development time  software companies like oracle became the new darlings of the industry  and dec started their own efforts in every  hot  niche  in some cases several projects for the same niche  some of these products competed with dec s own partners  notably rdb which competed with oracle s products on the vax  part of a major partnership only a few years earlier     although many of these products were well designed  most of them were dec only or dec centric  and customers frequently ignored them and used third party products instead  this problem was further exacerbated by olsen s aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well engineered products would sell themselves  hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects  at the same time that workstations using risc microprocessors were starting to approach vax cpus in performance     as microprocessors continued to improve in the     s  it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of decs low end minicomputer lineup  worse  the berkeley risc and stanford mips designs were aiming to introduce    bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the vax family  dec s cash cow       constrained by the huge success of their vax vms products  which followed the proprietary model  the company was very late to respond to these threats  in the early     s  dec found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed  the company that created the minicomputer  a dominant networking technology  and arguably the first computers for personal use  had abandoned the  low end  market  whose dominance with the pdp   had built the company in a previous generation  decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses     one group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new vax family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines  this would limit the market erosion in the top end segment  where profit margins were maximized and dec could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor  this line of thought led  eventually  to the vax      series  which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in october       already two years late    the problems took so long to work out  and the prices of the systems were so high  that dec was never able to make the line the success they hoped     others within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own risc designs and use those to build new machines  however  there was little official support for these efforts  and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the us  eventually these were gathered into the dec prism project  which delivered a credible    bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new vax implementation    infighting with teams dedicated to dec s big iron made funding difficult  and the design was not finalized until april       and then cancelled shortly thereafter       another group concluded that new workstations like those from sun microsystems and silicon graphics would take away a large part of dec s existing customer base before the new vax systems could address the issues  and that the company needed its own unix workstation as soon as possible  fed up with slow progress on both the risc and vax fronts  a group in palo alto started a skunkworks project to introduce their own systems  selecting the mips processor  which was widely available  introducing the new decstation series with the model      on    january         these systems would see some success in the market  but were later displaced by similar models running the alpha     eventually  in       dec launched the decchip       processor  the first implementation of their alpha instruction set architecture  initially named alphaxa axp  the  axp  was a  non acronym  and was later dropped   this was a    bit risc architecture  as opposed to the    bit cisc architecture used in the vax  and one of the first  pure   not an extension of an earlier    bit architecture     bit microprocessor architectures and implementations  the alpha offered class leading performance at its launch  and subsequent variants continued to do so into the     s  an alphaserver sc   supercomputer was still ranked no xa   in the world in november         alpha based computers  the dec axp series  later the alphastation and alphaserver series  superseded both the vax and mips architecture in dec s product lines  and could run openvms  dec osf   axp  later  digital unix or tru   unix  and microsoft s then new operating system  windows nt     in       following the takeover by compaq computers  a decision was made that microsoft would no longer support and develop windows nt for the alpha series computers  a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the alpha series computers     in the mid     s  digital semiconductor collaborated with arm limited to produce the strongarm microprocessor  this was based in part on arm  and in part on dec technologies like alpha  and was targeted at embedded systems and portable devices  it was highly compatible with the armv  architecture and was very successful  competing effectively against rivals such as the superh and mips architectures in the portable digital assistant market  microsoft subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their pocket pc platform  in       as part of a lawsuit settlement  the strongarm intellectual property was sold to intel  they continued to produce strongarm  as well as developing it into the xscale architecture  intel subsequently sold this business to marvell technology group in          the video on demand project at dec started in       following ken olsen s retirement  at the time the company was rapidly downsizing under robert palmer  and it was difficult to gain funding for any new project  dec s interactive video information server architecture gained traction and excelled over those of other companies  in that it was highly scalable  using a gateway to setup interactive video delivery sessions on large numbers of video and information servers  initially high end vaxes were used  then alphas          the scalability feature allowed it to win contracts for many of the video on demand trials in the           timeframe  since the system could theoretically accommodate unlimited interactive video streams and other non video content       the design was proposed and incorporated into the mpeg  international standard    its object oriented interface became the mandatory user to user core interface in dsm cc  widely used in video stream and file delivery for mpeg   compliant systems     commercially  dec s digital and interactive information system was used by adlink to distribute advertising to over   million subscribers          beyond decsystem        pdp  vax and alpha  digital was well respected for its communication subsystem designs  such as ethernet  dna  digital network architecture   predominantly decnet products   dsa  digital storage architecture   disks tapes controllers   and its  dumb terminal  subsystems including vt    and decserver products       at its peak in the late     s  digital had     billion in sales and ranked among the most profitable companies in the usa  with its strong staff of engineers  digital was expected to usher in the age of personal computers  but the autocratic and trend resistant mr  olsen was openly skeptical of the desktop machines  saying  the personal computer will fall flat on its face in business   and regarding them as  toys  used for playing video games  digital s fortunes declined after missing out on some critical market shifts  particularly toward the personal computer  the board forced olsen to resign as president in july            in june       ken olsen was replaced by robert palmer as the company s president  digital s board of directors also granted palmer the title of chief executive officer   ceo    a title that had never been used during digital s    year existence  palmer had joined dec in      to run semiconductor engineering and manufacturing  his relentless campaign to be ceo  and success with the alpha microprocessor family  made him a candidate to succeed olsen  at the same time a more modern logo was designed      palmer restructured digital into nine business units that reported directly to him  nonetheless  digital continued to suffer record losses in recent quarters  including a loss of        million for the quarter that ended on september           it reported      billion in losses for its fiscal year       january         saw the retirement of john f  smith as senior vice president of operations  the second in command at digital  and his position was not filled  a    year company veteran  he had joined digital in      as the company s   th employee  passing up a chance to work for bell laboratories in new jersey to work for digital  then a tiny start up company in the mill town of maynard  mass  smith rose to become one of the three senior vice presidents in      and was widely considered among the potential successors to ken olsen  especially when smith was appointed chief operating officer in       smith became a corporate spokesman on financial issues  and had filled in at trouble spots for which olsen ordered more attention  however smith was passed over in favor of palmer when olsen was forced to resign in july       though smith stayed on for a time to help turn around the struggling company       in june       palmer and several of his top lieutenants presented their reorganization plans to applause from the board of directors  and several weeks later digital reported its first profitable quarter in several years  however on april           digital reported a loss of      million three to four times higher than the loss many people on wall street had predicted  compared with a loss of     million in the comparable period a year earlier   causing the stock price on the nyse to plunge        to      a    percent drop  the losses at that point totaled      million for the current fiscal year  sales of the vax  long the company s biggest moneymaker  continued to decline  which in turn also hurt digital s lucrative service and maintenance business  that made up more than a third of digital equipment s revenue of     billion in the      fiscal year   which declined    percent year over year to      billion in the most recent quarter  market s acceptance of digital alpha computers and chips has been slower than the company had hoped  even though alpha s sales for the quarter estimated at      million were up significantly from      million in the december quarter  digital also made a strong push into personal computers and workstations  which had even lower margins than alpha computers and chips  also  digital was playing catchup with its own unix offerings for client server networks  as it long emphasized its own vms software  while corporate computer users based their client server networks on the industry standard unix software  of which hewlett packard was one of the market leaders   digital s problems were similar to that of larger rival i b m   due to the fundamental shift in the computer industry that made it unlikely that digital could ever again operate profitably at its former size of         employees  and while its workforce had been reduced to        people many analysts expected that they would have to cut another              during the profitable years up until the early     s  dec was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff    following the      economic downturn  layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat    palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing dec back to profitability  which he attempted to do by changing the established dec business culture  hiring new executives from outside the company  and selling off various non core business units       by       digital had subsidiary companies in more than two dozen countries including austria  australia  belgium  brazil  canada  china  people s republic   colombia  cyprus  czech republic  denmark  finland  france  germany  ireland  israel  japan  jersey states  new zealand  netherlands  norway  russia  singapore  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan  and the united kingdom       eventually  on    january       what remained of the company  including digital s multivendor global services organization and customer support centers  was sold to pc manufacturer compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry  several years earlier  compaq had considered a bid for digital but became seriously interested only after digital s major divestments and refocusing on the internet in       at the time of compaq s acquisition announcement  digital had a total of        employees  down from a peak of         in the     s  but it still employed about    percent more people than compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues  after the merger closed  compaq moved aggressively to reduce digital s high selling  general  and administrative  sg a  costs  equal to    percent of total      revenues  and bring them more in line with compaq s sg a expense ratio of    percent of revenues       compaq used the acquisition to move into enterprise services and compete with ibm  and by      services made up over     of compaq s revenues  largely due to the digital employees inherited from the merger    digital s own pc manufacturing was discontinued after the merger closed  as compaq did not wish to compete with one of its key partner suppliers  the remainder of digital semiconductor  the alpha microprocessor group  was sold to intel  which placed those employees back in their hudson  massachusetts  office  which they had vacated when the site was sold to intel in          compaq struggled as a result of the merger with digital    and was acquired by hewlett packard in       compaq  and later hp  continued to sell many of the former digital products but re branded with their own logos  for example  hp now sells what were formerly digital s storageworks disk tape products    as a result of the compaq acquisition     the digital logo survived for a while after the company ceased to exist  as the logo of digital globalsoft  an it services company in india  which was a    percent subsidiary of compaq   digital globalsoft was later renamed  hp globalsoft   also known as the  hp global delivery india center  or hp gdic   and no longer uses the digital logo     the digital com and dec com domain names are now owned by hewlett packard and redirect to their us website    digital once held the class a ip address block                  the digital federal credit union  dcu  now dfcu   which was chartered in      for employees of dec  is now open to essentially everyone  dfcu has over     different sponsors  including the companies that acquired pieces of dec     dec s research laboratories  or research labs  as they were commonly known  conducted digital s corporate research  some of them were operated by compaq and are still operated by hewlett packard  the laboratories were     some of the former employees of digital s research labs or digital s r d in general include     some of the former employees of digital equipment corp who were responsible for developing alpha and strongarm    some of the work of the research labs was published in the digital technical journal    which was in published from      until            digital supported the ansi standards  especially the ascii character set  which survives in unicode and the iso      character set family  digital s own multinational character set also had a large influence on iso         latin    and  by extension  unicode      the first versions of the c language and the unix operating system ran on digital s pdp series of computers  first on a pdp    then the pdp    s   which were among the first commercially viable minicomputers  although for several years digital itself did not encourage the use of unix     digital produced widely used and influential interactive operating systems  including os    tops     tops     rsts e  rsx     rt     and openvms  pdp computers  in particular the pdp    model  inspired a generation of programmers and software developers  some pdp    systems more than    years old  software and hardware  are still being used to control and monitor factories  transportation systems and nuclear plants  digital was an early champion of time sharing systems     the command line interfaces found in digital s systems  eventually codified as dcl  would look familiar to any user of modern microcomputer clis  those used in earlier systems  such as ctss  ibm s jcl  or univac s time sharing systems  would look utterly alien  many features of the cp m and ms dos cli show a recognizable family resemblance to digital s oses  including command names such as dir and help and the  name dot extension  file naming conventions     vax and microvax computers  very widespread in the     s  running vms formed one of the most important proprietary networks  decnet  which linked business and research facilities  the decnet protocols formed one of the first peer to peer networking standards  with decnet phase i being released in the mid     s  email  file sharing  and distributed collaborative projects existed within the company long before their value was recognized in the market     digital  intel and xerox through their collaboration to create the dix standard  were champions of ethernet  but digital is the company that made ethernet commercially successful  initially  ethernet based decnet and lat protocols interconnected vaxes with decserver terminal servers  starting with the unibus to ethernet adapter  multiple generations of ethernet hardware from digital were the de facto standard  the ci  computer interconnect  adapter was the industry s first network interface controller to use separate transmit and receive  rings      digital also invented clustering  an operating system technology that treated multiple machines as one logical entity  clustering permitted sharing of pooled disk and tape storage via the hsc         and later series of hierarchical storage controllers  hsc   the hscs delivered the first hardware raid   and raid   capabilities and the first serial interconnects of multiple storage technologies  this technology was the forerunner to architectures such as network of workstations which are used for massively cooperative tasks such as web searches and drug research     the la   and la    dot matrix printers became industry standards and may have hastened the demise of the teletype corporation     the vt    computer terminal became the industry standard  implementing a useful subset of the ansi x     standard  and even today terminal emulators such as hyperterminal  putty and xterm still emulate a vt     or its more capable successor  the vt         the x window system  the network transparent window system used on unix and linux  and also available on other operating systems  was developed at mit jointly between project athena and the laboratory for computer science  digital was the primary sponsor for this project  which was a contemporary of the gnu project but not associated with it     ndisputed   discuss in the period           linus torvalds developed versions of linux on early alphaserver systems made available to him by the engineering department  compaq software engineers developed special linux kernel modules    a well known linux distribution that ran on alphaserver systems was red hat        another distribution that ran on alpha was gentoo linux     microsoft was not exclusively bound to the alpha chip so it pursued other processor makers such as ibm with the powerpc architecture and eventually capitalized on the emerging strength of the intel x   based processors     notes    and its follow on product  vax notes  were two of the first examples of online collaboration software  a category that has become to be known as groupware  len kawell  one of the original notes    developers later joined lotus development corporation and contributed to their lotus notes product     digital was one of the first businesses connected to the internet  with dec com  registered in         being one of the first of the now ubiquitous  com domains  dec s gatekeeper dec com was a well known software repository during the pre world wide web days  and digital was also the first computer vendor to open a public website  on   october         the popular altavista  created by digital  was one of the first comprehensive internet search engines   although lycos was earlier  it was much more limited      dec invented digital linear tape  dlt   formerly known as compactape  which began as a compact backup medium for microvax systems  and later grew to capacities of     gigabytes     work on the first hard disk based mp  player  the personal jukebox  started at the dec systems research center   the project was started about a month before the merger into compaq was completed      dec s western research lab created the itsy pocket computer  this was developed into the compaq ipaq line of pdas  which replaced the compaq aero pda     originally the users  group was called decus  digital equipment computer user society  during the     s to     s  when compaq acquired digital in       the users group was renamed cuo  the compaq users  organisation  when hp acquired compaq in       cuo became hp interex  although there are still decus groups in several countries  in the united states  the organization is represented by the
