 the macintosh    m k nt    mak in tosh   or mac  is a series of personal computers  pcs  designed  developed  and marketed by apple inc     steve jobs introduced the original macintosh computer on january           this was the first mass market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse   this first model was later renamed to  macintosh    k  for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on apple s same proprietary architecture  the macintosh product family has been collectively and singularly nicknamed  mac  or  the mac  since the development of the first model     the macintosh  however  was expensive  which caused it to be overtaken in sales by the aggressively priced ibm personal computer and its accompanying clone market  macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept apple as the second largest pc manufacturer for the next decade  in the     s  improvements in the rival wintel platform  notably with the introduction of windows      gradually took market share from the more expensive macintosh systems  the performance advantage of       based macintosh systems was eroded by intel s pentium  and in      apple was relegated to third place as compaq became the top pc manufacturer  even after a transition to the superior powerpc based power macintosh line in       the falling prices of commodity pc components and the release of windows    saw the macintosh user base decline     in       after the return of steve jobs  apple consolidated its multiple consumer level desktop models into the all in one imac g   which became a commercial success and revitalized the brand  since their transition to intel processors in       the complete lineup is entirely based on said processors and associated systems  its current lineup comprises three desktops  the all in one imac  entry level mac mini  and the mac pro tower graphics workstation   and four laptops  the macbook  macbook air  macbook pro  and macbook pro with retina display   its xserve server was discontinued in      in favor of the mac mini and mac pro     production of the mac is based on a vertical integration model  apple facilitates all aspects of its hardware and creates its own operating system that is pre installed on all mac computers  unlike most ibm pc compatibles  where multiple sellers create and integrate hardware intended to run another company s operating system  apple exclusively produces mac hardware  choosing internal systems  designs  and prices  apple also develops the operating system for the mac  currently os x version        yosemite   macs are currently capable of running non apple operating systems such as linux  openbsd  and microsoft windows with the aid of boot camp or third party software  apple does not license os x for use on non apple computers  though it did license previous versions of mac os through their macintosh clone program from      to                  the macintosh project was begun in      by jef raskin  an apple employee who envisioned an easy to use  low cost computer for the average consumer  he wanted to name the computer after his favorite type of apple  the mcintosh   but the spelling was changed to  macintosh  for legal reasons as the original was the same spelling as that used by mcintosh laboratory  inc   the audio equipment manufacturer   steve jobs requested that mcintosh laboratory give apple a release for the name with its changed spelling so that apple could use it  but the request was denied  forcing apple to eventually buy the rights to use the name    a      byte magazine article suggested apple changed the spelling only after  early users  misspelled  mcintosh    however  jef raskin had adopted the macintosh spelling by        when the macintosh computer was still a single prototype machine in the lab  this explanation further clashes with the first explanation given above that the change was made for  legal reasons       raskin was authorized to start hiring for the project in september        and he immediately asked his long time colleague  brian howard  to join him   his initial team would eventually consist of himself  howard  joanna hoffman  burrell smith  and bud tribble   the rest of the original mac team would include bill atkinson  bob belleville  steve capps  george crow  donn denman  chris espinosa  andy hertzfeld  bruce horn  susan kare  larry kenyon  and caroline rose with steve jobs leading the project       smith s first macintosh board was built to raskin s design specifications  it had   xa kilobytes  kb  of ram  used the motorola     e microprocessor  and was capable of supporting a         pixel black and white bitmap display  bud tribble  a member of the mac team  was interested in running the lisa s graphical programs on the macintosh  and asked smith whether he could incorporate the lisa s motorola       microprocessor into the mac while still keeping the production cost down  by december       smith had succeeded in designing a board that not only used the        but increased its speed from  xa mhz to  xa mhz  this board also had the capacity to support a         pixel display  smith s design used fewer ram chips than the lisa  which made production of the board significantly more cost efficient  the final mac design was self contained and had the complete quickdraw picture language and interpreter in    kb of romxa   far more than most other computers  it had    xa kb of ram  in the form of sixteen   xa kilobit  kb  ram chips soldered to the logicboard  though there were no memory slots  its ram was expandable to    xa kb by means of soldering sixteen ic sockets to accept    xa kb ram chips in place of the factory installed chips  the final product s screen was a   inch     x    pixel monochrome display  exceeding the size of the planned screen       burrel s innovative design  which combined the low production cost of an apple ii with the computing power of lisa s cpu  the motorola   k  received the attention of steve jobs    co founder of apple  realizing that the macintosh was more marketable than the lisa  he began to focus his attention on the project  raskin left the team in      over a personality conflict with jobs  team member andy hertzfeld said that the final macintosh design is closer to jobs  ideas than raskin s   after hearing of the pioneering gui technology being developed at xerox parc  jobs had negotiated a visit to see the xerox alto computer and its smalltalk development tools in exchange for apple stock options  the lisa and macintosh user interfaces were influenced by technology seen at xerox parc and were combined with the macintosh group s own ideas    jobs also commissioned industrial designer hartmut esslinger to work on the macintosh line  resulting in the  snow white  design language  although it came too late for the earliest macs  it was implemented in most other mid  to late     s apple computers    however  jobs  leadership at the macintosh project did not last  after an internal power struggle with new ceo john sculley  jobs resigned from apple in         he went on to found next  another computer company targeting the education market    and did not return until       when apple acquired next       after the lisa s announcement  john dvorak discussed rumors of a mysterious  macintosh  project at apple in february         the company announced the macintosh    k manufactured at an apple factory in fremont  california in october       followed by an    page brochure included with various magazines in december      the macintosh was introduced by a us    xa million ridley scott television commercial            it most notably aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january           and is now considered a  watershed event    and a  masterpiece            used an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the macintosh  indicated by a picasso style picture of the computer on her white tank top  as a means of saving humanity from the  conformity  of ibm s attempts to dominate the computer industry  the ad alludes to george orwell s novel  nineteen eighty four  which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised  big brother          two days after        aired  the macintosh went on sale  and came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface  macwrite and macpaint  it was first demonstrated by steve jobs in the first of his famous mac keynote speeches  and though the mac garnered an immediate  enthusiastic following  some labeled it a mere  toy     because the operating system was designed largely around the gui  existing text mode and command driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten  this was a time consuming task that many software developers chose not to undertake  and could be regarded as a reason for an initial lack of software for the new system  in april       microsoft s multiplan migrated over from ms dos  with microsoft word following in january         in       lotus software introduced lotus jazz for the macintosh platform after the success of lotus       for the ibm pc  although it was largely a flop    apple introduced the macintosh office suite the same year with the  lemmings  ad  infamous for insulting its own potential customers  the ad was not successful       apple spent      million purchasing all    advertising pages in a special  post election issue of newsweek    and ran a  test drive a macintosh  promotion  in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a macintosh for    hours and return it to a dealer afterwards  while         people participated  dealers disliked the promotion  the supply of computers was insufficient for demand  and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold  this marketing campaign caused ceo john sculley to raise the price from us       to us        about        when adjusted for inflation in            the computer sold well  nonetheless  reportedly outselling the ibm pcjr which also began shipping early that year    by april      the company sold        macintoshes  and hoped for        by early may and almost         by the end of the year       jobs stated during the macintosh s introduction  we expect macintosh to become the third industry standard   after the apple ii and ibm pc  although outselling every other computer  it did not meet expectations during the first year  especially among business customers  only about ten applications including macwrite and macpaint were widely available    although many non apple software developers participated in the introduction and apple promised that    companies including lotus  digital research  and ashton tate were creating products for the new computer  after one year  it had less than one quarter of the software selection available compared to the ibm pc including only one word processor  two databases  and one spreadsheet although apple had sold         macintoshes compared to ibm s sales of fewer than         pcs  developers were required to learn how to write software that used the macintosh s graphic user interface       in       the combination of the mac  apple s laserwriter printer  and mac specific software like boston software s macpublisher and aldus pagemaker enabled users to design  preview  and print page layouts complete with text and graphics an activity to become known as desktop publishing  initially  desktop publishing was unique to the macintosh  but eventually became available for other platforms    later  applications such as macromedia freehand  quarkxpress  and adobe s photoshop and illustrator strengthened the mac s position as a graphics computer and helped to expand the emerging desktop publishing market     the macintosh s minimal memory became apparent  even compared with other personal computers in       and could not be expanded easily  it also lacked a hard disk drive or the means to easily attach one  many small companies sprang up to address the memory issue  suggestions revolved around either upgrading the memory to     kb or removing the computer s    memory chips and replacing them with larger capacity chips  a tedious operation that was not always successful  in october       apple introduced the macintosh    k  with quadruple the memory of the original  at a price of us          it also offered an upgrade for    k macs that involved replacing the logicboard  in an attempt to improve connectivity  apple released the macintosh plus on january           for a price of us        it offered one megabyte of ram  easily expandable to four megabytes by the use of socketed ram boards  it also featured a scsi parallel interface  allowing up to seven peripherals such as hard drives and scanners to be attached to the machine  its floppy drive was increased to an    xa kb capacity  the mac plus was an immediate success and remained in production  unchanged  until october           on sale for just over four years and ten months  it was the longest lived macintosh in apple s history    in september       apple introduced the macintosh programmer s workshop  or mpw  an application that allowed software developers to create software for macintosh on macintosh  rather than cross compiling from a lisa  in august       apple unveiled hypercard and multifinder  which added cooperative multitasking to the macintosh  apple began bundling both with every macintosh     updated motorola cpus made a faster machine possible  and in      apple took advantage of the new motorola technology and introduced the macintosh ii at        powered by a   xa mhz motorola       processor    the primary improvement in the macintosh ii was color quickdraw in rom  a color version of the graphics language which was the heart of the machine  among the many innovations in color quickdraw were the ability to handle any display size  any color depth  and multiple monitors  the macintosh ii marked the start of a new direction for the macintosh  as now for the first time it had an open architecture with several nubus expansion slots  support for color graphics and external monitors  and a modular design similar to that of the ibm pc  it had an internal hard drive and a power supply with a fan  which was initially fairly loud    one third party developer sold a device to regulate fan speed based on a heat sensor  but it voided the warranty    later macintosh computers had quieter power supplies and hard drives  the macintosh se was released at the same time as the macintosh ii for        or       with hard drive   as the first compact mac with a   xa mb internal hard drive and an expansion slot    the se s expansion slot was located inside the case along with the crt  potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage  for this reason  apple recommended users bring their se to an authorized apple dealer to have upgrades performed    the se also updated jerry manock and terry oyama s original design and shared the macintosh ii s snow white design language  as well as the new apple desktop bus  adb  mouse and keyboard that had first appeared on the apple iigs some months earlier     in       apple spun off its software business as claris  it was given the code and rights to several applications that had been written within apple  most notably macwrite  macpaint  and macproject  in the late     s  claris released a number of revamped software titles  the result was the  pro  series  including macdraw pro  macwrite pro  and filemaker pro  to provide a complete office suite  claris purchased the rights to the informix wingz spreadsheet program on the mac  renaming it claris resolve  and added the new presentation software claris impact  by the early     s  claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer level macintoshes and were extremely popular  in       claris released clarisworks  which soon became their second best selling application  when claris was reincorporated back into apple in       clarisworks was renamed appleworks beginning with version           in       apple sued microsoft and hewlett packard on the grounds that they infringed apple s copyrighted gui  citing  among other things  the use of rectangular  overlapping  and resizable windows  after four years  the case was decided against apple  as were later appeals  apple s actions were criticized by some in the software community  including the free software foundation  fsf   who felt apple was trying to monopolize on guis in general  and boycotted gnu software for the macintosh platform for seven years         with the new motorola       processor came the macintosh iix in       which had benefited from internal improvements  including an on board mmu    it was followed in      by the macintosh iicx  a more compact version with fewer slots    and a version of the mac se powered by the   xa mhz        the macintosh se       later that year  the macintosh iici  running at   xa mhz  was the first mac to be     bit clean   this allowed it to natively support more than  xa mb of ram    unlike its predecessors  which had     bit dirty  roms    of the   xa bits available for addressing were used for os level flags   system   was the first macintosh operating system to support    bit addressing    the following year  the macintosh iifx  starting at us        was unveiled  apart from its fast   xa mhz       processor  it had significant internal architectural improvements  including faster memory and two apple ii cpus      s  dedicated to i o processing       microsoft windows     was released in may       and according to a common saying at the time  windows was not as good as macintosh  but it was good enough for the average user   though still a graphical wrapper that relied upon ms dos      was the first iteration of windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the much more expensive macintosh platform  it also did not help matters that during the previous year jean louis gass e had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on mac computers  finally  there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially expanding pc industry in       forcing apple usa head allan loren to cut prices which dropped apple s margins       in response  apple introduced a range of relatively inexpensive macs in october       the macintosh classic  essentially a less expensive version of the macintosh se  was the least expensive mac offered until early         the       powered macintosh lc  in its distinctive  pizza box  case  offered color graphics and was accompanied by a new  low cost         pixel monitor    the macintosh iisi was essentially a   xa mhz iici with only one expansion slot    all three machines sold well    although apple s profit margin on them was considerably lower than that on earlier models       apple improved macintosh computers by introducing models equipped with newly available processors from the   k lineup  the macintosh classic ii   and macintosh lc ii  which used a   xa mhz       cpu    were joined in      by the macintosh quadra       and        the first macs to employ the faster motorola       processor     it wasn t long until apple released their first portable computers  beginning with the macintosh portable released in       although due to considerable design issues  it was soon replaced in      with the first of the powerbook line  the powerbook      a miniaturized portable  the   xa mhz       powerbook      and the   xa mhz       powerbook        they were the first portable computers with the keyboard behind a palm rest and a built in pointing device  a trackball  in front of the keyboard    the      powerbook    c was apple s first portable computer to feature a color screen  displaying     colors with     x     pixel resolution    the second generation of powerbooks  the       equipped     series  introduced trackpads  integrated stereo speakers  and built in ethernet to the laptop form factor in            as for mac os  system   was a    bit rewrite from pascal to c   that introduced virtual memory and improved the handling of color graphics  as well as memory addressing  networking  and co operative multitasking  also during this time  the macintosh began to shed the  snow white  design language  along with the expensive consulting fees they were paying to frogdesign  apple instead brought the design work in house by establishing the apple industrial design group  becoming responsible for crafting a new look for all apple products       intel had tried unsuccessfully to push apple to migrate the macintosh platform to intel chips  apple concluded that intel s cisc  complex instruction set computer  architecture ultimately would not be able to compete against risc  reduced instruction set computer  processors    while the motorola       offered the same features as the intel       and could on a clock for clock basis significantly outperform the intel chip  the     had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems  especially the clock doubled i   dx  which ran the cpu logic at twice the external bus speed  giving such equipped ibm compatible systems a significant performance lead over their macintosh equivalents      apple s product design and engineering didn t help matters as they restricted the use of the      to their expensive quadras for a time while the     was readily available to oems as well as enthusiasts who put together their own machines  in late       as the higher end macintosh desktop lineup transitioned to the       apple was unable to offer the      in their top of the line powerbooks until early      with the powerbook     series  several years after the first     powered ibm compatible laptops hit the market which cost apple considerable sales  in      intel rolled out the pentium processors as the successor to the      while the motorola       was never released  leaving the macintosh platform a generation behind ibm compatibles in the latest cpu technology  in       apple abandoned motorola cpus for the risc powerpc architecture developed by the aim alliance of apple computer  ibm  and motorola    the power macintosh line  the first to use the new chips  proved to be highly successful  with over a million powerpc units sold in nine months    however in the long run  spurning intel for the powerpc was a mistake as the commoditization of intel architecture chips meant apple couldn t compete on price against  the dells of the world        notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the macintosh  the falling costs of components made ibm pc compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption  over macintosh systems that remained fairly expensive  a successful price war initiated by compaq vaulted them from third place to first among pc manufacturers in       overtaking a struggling ibm and relegating apple to third place           furthermore  apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers  at one point  its product lineup was subdivided into classic  lc  ii  quadra  performa  and centris models  with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names    these models competed against macintosh clones  hardware manufactured by third parties that ran apple s system    this succeeded in increasing the macintosh s market share somewhat  and provided cheaper hardware for consumers  but hurt apple financially as existing apple customers began to buy cheaper clones which cannibalized the sales of apple s higher margin macintosh systems  yet apple still shouldered the burden of developing the mac os platform     apple s market share further struggled due to the release of the windows    operating system  which unified microsoft s formerly separate ms dos and windows products  windows    significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of ibm pc compatible computers  and brought the capabilities of windows to parity with the mac os gui     when steve jobs returned to apple in      following the company s purchase of next  he ordered that the os that had been previewed as version     be branded mac os    in place of the never to appear copland os   since apple had licensed only system   to third parties  this move effectively ended the clone line  the decision caused significant financial losses for companies like motorola  who produced the starmax  umax  who produced the supermac    and power computing  who offered several lines of mac clones  including the powerwave  powertower  and powertower pro    these companies had invested substantial resources in creating their own mac compatible hardware    apple bought out power computing s license  but allowed umax to continue selling mac clones until their license expired  as they had a sizeable presence in the lower end segment that apple did not citation needed    in       apple introduced its new imac which  like the original    k mac  was an all in one computer  its translucent plastic case  originally bondi blue and later various additional colors  is considered an industrial design landmark of the late     s  the imac did away with most of apple s standard  and usually proprietary  connections  such as scsi and adb  in favor of two usb ports    it replaced a floppy disk drive with a cd rom drive for installing software      but was incapable of writing to cds or other media without external third party hardware  the imac proved to be phenomenally successful  with         units sold in     days    it made the company an annual profit of us    xa million  apple s first profitable year since michael spindler took over as ceo in         this aesthetic was applied to the power macintosh and later the ibook  apple s first consumer level laptop computer  filling the missing quadrant of apple s  four square product matrix   desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals     more than         pre orders were placed before it started shipping in september    and by october proved to be a large success       in early       apple began shipping computers with cd rw drives and emphasized the mac s ability to play dvds by including dvd rom and dvd ram drives as standard    steve jobs admitted that apple had been  late to the party  on writable cd technology  but felt that macs could become a  digital hub  that linked and enabled an  emerging digital lifestyle     apple would later introduce an update to its itunes music player software that enabled it to burn cds  along with a controversial  rip  mix  burn  advertising campaign that some   felt encouraged media piracy    this accompanied the release of the ipod  apple s first successful handheld device  apple continued to launch products  such as the unsuccessful power mac g  cube    the education oriented emac  and the titanium  and later aluminium  powerbook g  laptop for professionals     the original imac used a powerpc g  processor  but g  and g  chips were soon added  both accompanied by complete case redesigns that dropped the array of colors in favor of white plastic  as of       all imacs use aluminium cases  on january           apple announced the mac mini  priced at us      making it the cheapest mac         mac os continued to evolve up to version        including retrofits such as the addition of a nanokernel and support for multiprocessing services     in mac os      though its dated architecture made replacement necessary    initially developed in the pascal programming language  it was substantially rewritten in c   for system    from its beginnings on an  xa mhz machine with    xa kb of ram  it had grown to support apple s latest  xa ghz g  equipped macs  since its architecture was laid down  features that were already common on apple s competition  like preemptive multitasking and protected memory  had become feasible on the kind of hardware apple manufactured  as such  apple introduced mac os x  a fully overhauled unix based successor to mac os    os x uses darwin  xnu  and mach as foundations  and is based on nextstep  it was released to the public in september       as the mac os x public beta  featuring a revamped user interface called  aqua   at us        it allowed adventurous mac users to sample apple s new operating system and provide feedback for the actual release    the initial version of mac os x        cheetah   was released on march           older mac os applications could still run under early mac os x versions  using an environment called  classic   subsequent releases of mac os x included       puma   september                  jaguar   august                  panther   october           and       tiger   april               apple discontinued the use of powerpc microprocessors in       at wwdc       steve jobs announced this transition  revealing that mac os x was always developed to run on both the intel and powerpc architectures    all new macs now use x   processors made by intel  and some were renamed as a result    intel based macs running os x      and below  support has been discontinued since       can run pre existing software developed for powerpc using an emulator called rosetta     although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs  however  the classic environment is unavailable on the intel architecture  intel chips introduced the potential to run the microsoft windows operating system natively on apple hardware  without emulation software such as virtual pc  in march       a group of hackers announced that they were able to run windows xp on an intel based mac  the group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website     on april          apple announced the availability of the public beta of boot camp  software that allows owners of intel based macs to install windows xp on their machines  later versions added support for windows vista and windows    classic was discontinued in mac os x       and boot camp became a standard feature on intel based macs           starting in       apple s industrial design shifted to favor aluminum  which was used in the construction of the first macbook pro  glass was added in      with the introduction of the unibody macbook pro  these materials are billed as environmentally friendly     the imac  macbook pro  macbook air  and mac mini lines currently all use aluminum enclosures  and are now made of a single unibody           chief designer jonathan ive continues to guide products towards a minimalist and simple feel        including eliminating of replaceable batteries in notebooks     multi touch gestures from the iphone s interface have been applied to the mac line in the form of touch pads on notebooks and the magic mouse and magic trackpad for desktops     on february           apple became the first company to bring to market a computer that utilized intel s new thunderbolt  codename light peak  i o interface  using the same physical interface as a mini displayport  and backwards compatible with that standard  thunderbolt boasts two way transfer speeds of   xa gbit s        nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn        apple directly sub contracts hardware production to asian original equipment manufacturers such as asus  maintaining a high degree of control over the end product  by contrast  most other companies  including microsoft  create software that can be run on hardware produced by a variety of third parties such as dell  hp compaq  and lenovo  consequently  the macintosh buyer has comparably fewer options  but superior integration on those options     the current mac product family uses intel x      processors  apple introduced an emulator during the transition from powerpc chips  called rosetta   much as it did during the transition from motorola       architecture a decade earlier  the macintosh is the only mainstream computer platform to have successfully transitioned to a new cpu architecture     and has done so twice  all current mac models ship with at least  xa gb of ram as standard  current mac computers use ati radeon or nvidia geforce graphics cards as well as intel graphics built into the main cpu  all current macs  except for the macbook air  mac mini  and macbook pro with retina display  ship with an optical media drive that includes a dual function dvd cd burner  apple refers to this as a superdrive  current macs include two standard data transfer ports  usb and firewire  except for the macbook air  which does not include firewire   macbook pro  imac  macbook air  and mac mini computers now also feature the  thunderbolt  port  which apple says can transfer data at speeds up to    gigabits per second     usb was introduced in the      imac g  and is ubiquitous today    while firewire is mainly reserved for high performance devices such as hard drives or video cameras  starting with the then new imac g   released in october       apple started to include built in isight cameras on appropriate models  and a media center interface called front row that can be operated by an apple remote or keyboard for accessing media stored on the computer  front row has been discontinued as of       however  and the apple remote is no longer bundled with new macs           apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels  macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons  even from third parties  until mac os x arrived in          apple continued to offer only single button mice  in both wired and bluetooth wireless versions  until august       when it introduced the mighty mouse  while it looked like a traditional one button mouse  it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball  capable of independent x  and y axis movement     a bluetooth version followed in july          in october       apple introduced the magic mouse  which uses multi touch gesture recognition  similar to that of the iphone  instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball     it is available only in a wireless configuration  but the wired mighty mouse  re branded as  apple mouse   is still available as an alternative  since       apple has also offered the magic trackpad as a means to control macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops     the original macintosh was the first successful personal computer to use a graphical user interface devoid of a command line  it uses a desktop metaphor  depicting real world objects like documents and a trashcan as icons onscreen  the system software was introduced in      with the first macintosh  renamed mac os in       and continued to evolve until version           in       apple introduced mac os x  based on darwin and nextstep  its new features included the dock and the aqua user interface  during the transition  apple included a virtual machine subsystem known as classic  allowing users to run mac os   applications under mac os x      and earlier on powerpc machines  apple introduced mac os x      in february  and it was made available in the summer of       mountain lion includes many new features  such as mission control  the mac app store  available to mac os x v        snow leopard   users by software update   launchpad  an application viewer and launcher akin to the ios home screen  and resume  a feature similar to the hibernate function found in microsoft windows  the most recent version is mac os x v       yosemite   in addition to mavericks  all new macs are bundled with assorted apple produced applications  including ilife  the safari web browser and the itunes media player  apple introduced mavericks at wwdc      in june  and released it on october    of that year  it is free of charge to everyone running snow leopard or later and is compatible with most macs from      and later  mavericks brought a lot of the ios apps  functions  and feel to the mac as well as better multi display support  ibooks  maps  app nap  and other upgrades to improve performance and battery life     historically  mac os x enjoyed a near absence of the types of malware and spyware that affect microsoft windows users           mac os x has a smaller usage share compared to microsoft windows  roughly    and      respectively      but it also has traditionally more secure unix roots  worms  as well as potential vulnerabilities  were noted in february       which led some industry analysts and anti virus companies to issue warnings that apple s mac os x is not immune to malware     increasing market share coincided with additional reports of a variety of attacks     apple releases security updates for its software     in early       mac os x experienced a large increase in malware attacks     and malware such as mac defender  macprotector  and macguard were seen as an increasing problem for mac users  at first  the malware installer required the user to enter the administrative password  but later versions were able to install without user input     initially  apple support staff were instructed not to assist in the removal of the malware or admit the existence of the malware issue  but as the malware spread  a support document was issued  apple announced an os x update to fix the problem  an estimated         users were affected           originally  the hardware architecture was so closely tied to the mac os operating system that it was impossible to boot an alternative operating system  the most common workaround  is to boot into mac os and then to hand over control to a mac os based bootloader application  used even by apple for a ux and mklinux  this technique is no longer necessary since the introduction of open firmware based pci macs  though it was formerly used for convenience on many old world rom systems due to bugs in the firmware implementation citation needed now  mac hardware boots directly from open firmware in most powerpc based macs or efi in all intel based macs     following the release of intel based macs  third party platform virtualization software such as parallels desktop  vmware fusion  and virtualbox began to emerge  these programs allow users to run microsoft windows or previously windows only software on macs at near native speed  apple also released boot camp and mac specific windows drivers that help users to install windows xp or vista and natively dual boot between mac os x and windows  though not condoned by apple  it is possible to run the linux operating system using boot camp or other virtualization workarounds           because mac os x is a unix operating system  borrowing heavily from freebsd  many applications written for linux or bsd run on mac os x  often using x    many popular commercial software applications from large developers  such as microsoft s office and adobe s photoshop are ported to both mac os and windows  a large amount of open source software applications  like the firefox web browser and the libreoffice office suite  are cross platform  and thereby also run natively on mac os     apple hyped the introduction of the original mac with their        commercial that aired during that year s super bowl     it was supplemented by a number of printed pamphlets and other tv ads demonstrating the new interface and emphasizing the mouse  many more brochures for new models like the macintosh plus and the performa followed  in the     s  apple started the  what s on your powerbook   campaign  with print ads and television commercials featuring celebrities describing how the powerbook helps them in their businesses and everyday lives  in       apple responded to the introduction of windows    with several print ads and a television commercial demonstrating its disadvantages and lack of innovation     in      with the return of steve jobs to apple  the think different campaign introduced the company s new slogan  and in      the switch campaign followed  the most recent advertising strategy for the macintosh by apple is the get a mac campaign  with north american  uk  and japanese variants        since       while apple has concentrated its advertising on the iphone and ipad  many of these ads show how users can seamlessly sync data between these devices and macs through icloud        apple introduces new products at  special events  hosted at the apple town hall auditorium  and at keynotes at the apple worldwide developers conference  formerly  it also announced new products at trade shows like the apple expo and the macworld expo  the events typically draw a large gathering of media representatives and spectators  and are preceded by speculation about possible new products  in the past  special events have been used to unveil apple s desktop and notebook computers  such as the imac and macbook  and other consumer electronic devices like the ipod  apple tv  and iphone  the keynotes as well as provide updates on sales and market share statistics  apple has begun to focus its advertising on its retail stores instead of these trade shows  the company s last macworld keynote was in             since the introduction of the macintosh  apple has struggled to gain a significant share of the personal computer market  at first  the macintosh    k suffered from a dearth of available software compared to ibm s pc  resulting in disappointing sales in      and       it took   xa days for       xa units to sell     although the aggressively priced ibm pc soon overtook apple in sales                 macintosh systems found success in education and desktop publishing     notwithstanding these technical and commercial successes on the macintosh platform  their systems remained fairly expensive  making them less competitive in light of the falling costs of components that made ibm pc compatibles cheaper and accelerated their adoption  in       jean louis gass e had steadfastly refused to lower the profit margins on mac computers  then there was a component shortage that rocked the exponentially expanding pc industry that year  forcing apple usa head allan loren to cut prices which dropped apple s margins  microsoft windows     was released in may       the first iteration of windows which had a feature set and performance comparable to the significantly costlier macintosh    furthermore  apple had created too many similar models that confused potential buyers  at one point the product lineup was subdivided into classic  lc  ii  quadra  performa  and centris models  with essentially the same computer being sold under a number of different names       compaq  who had previously held the third place spot among pc manufacturers during the     s and early     s  initiated a successful price war in      that vaulted them to the biggest by the year end  overtaking a struggling ibm and relegating apple to third place        apple s market share further struggled due to the release of the windows    operating system  which unified microsoft s formerly separate ms dos and windows products  windows    significantly enhanced the multimedia capability and performance of ibm pc compatible computers  and brought the capabilities of windows to parity with the mac os gui     steve jobs returned as interim ceo in      and terminated the macintosh clone program  while simplifying the computer product lines  in      the release of the imac g  all in one was a great success  selling         units in     days  providing a much needed boost to the ailing macintosh platform      the introduction of the power macintosh and ibook laptop completed  four square product matrix   desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals   with the ibook ranking as the most popular laptop in the u s  market for the      year           in       apple released the power mac g  cube  their first desktop since the discontinued power macintosh g   to slot between the imac g  and the power mac g   even with its innovative design  it was initially priced us     higher than the comparably equipped and more expandable base power mac g   while also not including a monitor  making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales     apple sold just        cubes in q  of      which was one third of expectations  compared to         macs during that same quarter  and cube sales dropped to        units in q  of          a price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the cube s reduced value compared to the imac and power mac g  lineup  and it was discontinued in july             starting in       apple moved to eliminate crt displays from its product line as part of aesthetic design and space saving measures with the imac g   however  the new imac with its flexible lcd flat panel monitor was considerably more expensive on its debut than the preceding imac g   largely due to the higher cost of the lcd technology at the time  in order to keep the macintosh affordable for the education market and due to obselescene of the imac g   apple created the emac in april      as the intended successor  however the emac s crt made it relatively bulky and somewhat outdated  while its all in one construction meant it could not expanded to meet consumer demand for larger monitors  the imac g  s relatively high prices were approaching that of laptops which were portable and had higher resolution lcd screens  meanwhile  windows pc manufacturers could offer desktop configurations with lcd flat panel monitors at prices comparable to the emac and at much lower cost than the imac g      the flop of the power mac g  cube  along with the more expensive imac g  and heavy emac  meant that macintosh desktop sales never reached the market share attained by the previous imac g   for the next half decade while macintosh sales held steady  it would instead be the ipod portable music player and itunes music download service that would drive apple s sales growth     in recent years  market share of the personal computer market is measured by browser hits  sales and installed base  if using the browser metric  mac market share has increased substantially in          if measuring market share by installed base  there were more than   xa million mac users by       compared to an installed base of around    xa million windows pcs        statistics from late      indicate that apple had     xa percent of the desktop share in the united states that had increased to     xa percent by q xa          as of october       research firms idc and gartner reported that apple s market share in the u s  had increased to about  xa percent     figures from december       showing a market share around  xa percent  idc  and    xa percent  gartner  are based on a more than   xa percent increase in unit sale from      to       the installed base of mac computers is hard to determine  with numbers ranging from     estimated in          to      estimated in           mac os x s share of the os market increased from       in december      to       in december       which is a     increase in market share during       compared with a     increase during          from      to       mac sales increased continuously on an annual basis  apple reported worldwide sales of     xa million macs during the      holiday season     as of mid       the macintosh continues to enjoy rapid market share increase in the us  growing from      of all computer shipments in      to      in          according to idc s quarterly pc tracker  globally  in  rd quarter of       apple s pc market share increased     percent year over year  with record sales of     million units  apple now sits in the number five spot  with a gobal market share of about    during       behind lenovo  hp  dell and acer        by march       the market share of os x in north america had increased to slightly over         whether the size of the mac s market share and installed base is relevant  and to whom  is a hotly debated issue  industry pundits have often called attention to the mac s relatively small market share to predict apple s impending doom  particularly in the early and mid     s when the company s future seemed bleakest  others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the mac s success  apple has positioned the mac as a higher end personal computer  and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget pc     because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly  the mac s increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry s expanding sales volume as a whole  apple s small market share  then  gives the impression that fewer people are using macs than did ten years ago  when exactly the opposite is true     soaring sales of the iphone and ipad mean that the portion of apple s profits represented by the macintosh has declined in       dropping to     from     two years earlier     others try to de emphasize market share  citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries     regardless of the mac s market share  apple has remained profitable since steve jobs  return and the company s subsequent reorganization     notably  a report published in the first quarter of      found that apple had a     market share in the personal computer market in the us  including     of all computers over            market research indicates that apple draws its customer base from a higher income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market        the sales breakdown of the macintosh have seen sales of desktop macs stayed mostly constant while being surpassed by that of mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably  seven out of ten macs sold were laptops in       a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by          the change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop imac moving from affordable  imac g   to upscale  imac g   and subsequent releases are considered premium all in ones  by contrast the msrp of the macbook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the macbook air and macbook pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a mac  with the exception of the even more inexpensive mac mini  the only sub       offering from apple  albeit without a monitor and keyboard   not surprisingly the macbooks are the top selling form factors of the macintosh platform today     the use of intel microprocessors has helped macs more directly compete with their windows counterparts on price and performance  and by the     s apple was receiving intel s latest cpus first before other pc manufacturers              in recent years  apple has seen a significant boost in sales of macs     this has been attributed  in part  to the success of the ipod and the iphone  a halo effect whereby satisfied ipod or iphone owners purchase more apple products  and apple has since capitalized on that with the icloud cloud service that allows users to seamlessly sync data between these devices and macs     nonetheless  like other personal computer manufacturers  the macintosh lines have been hurt by consumer trend towards smartphones and tablet computers  particularly apple s own iphone and ipad  respectively  as the computing devices of choice among consumers        although the pc market declined  apple still managed to ship     million macbooks in q        the majority of which are the macbook air  compared to         total ultrabooks        although there was dozens of ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while apple only offered    inch and    inch models of the macbook air     the air has been the best selling ultra portable in certain countries over windows ultrabooks  particularly the united states     while several ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest  the air was regarded by reviewers as the best all around subnotebook ultraportable in regard to  os x experience  full keyboard  superior trackpad  thunderbolt connector and the higher quality  all aluminum unibody construction      the air was among the first to receive intel s latest cpus before other pc manufacturers  and apple mac os x has gained market share on windows in recent years        through july          the macbook air took in    percent of all ultrabook sales in the united states  although being one of the higher priced competitors     though several ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the macbook air     the competitive pricing of macbooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent ultrabooks  as this contradicted the established  elitist aura  perception that apple products cost more but were higher quality  which made these most expensive ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were        apple has generally dominated the premium pc market  in      having a    percent market share for pcs priced at more than         according to npd     the apple macintosh took    percent of operating profits in the pc industry during q        compared to    percent for dell inc   seven percent at hewlett packard  six percent at lenovo and asus  and one percent for acer        while sales of macintosh have largely held steady  in comparison to apple s sales of the iphone and ipad which increased significantly during the     s  macintosh computers still enjoy high margins on a per unit basis  with the majority being their macbooks that are focused on the ultraportable niche that is the most profitable and only growing segment of pcs     it also helped that the macintosh lineup is simple  updated on a yearly schedule  and consistent across both apple retail stores  and authorized resellers where they have a special  store within a store  section to distinguish them from windows pcs  in contrast  windows pc manufacturers generally have a wide range of offerings  selling only a portion through retail with full selection on the web  and often with limited time or region specific models  apple s macintosh ranked third on the  list of intended brands for desktop purchases  for the      holiday season  then moved up to second in      by displacing hewlett packard  and in      took the top spot ahead of dell
