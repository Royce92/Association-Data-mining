 distributed energy  also district or decentralized energy is generated or stored by a variety of small  grid connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources  der  or distributed energy resource systems     conventional power stations  such as coal fired  gas and nuclear powered plants  as well as hydroelectric dams and large scale solar power stations  are centralized and often require electricity to be transmitted over long distances  by contrast  der systems are decentralized  modular and more flexible technologies  that are located close to the load they serve  albeit having capacities of only    megawatts  mw  or less     der systems typically use renewable energy sources  including  but not limited to  small hydro  biomass  biogas  solar power  wind power  geothermal power and increasingly play an important role for the electric power distribution system  a grid connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a der system  and is often called a distributed energy storage system  dess   by means of an interface  der systems can be managed and coordinated within a smart grid  distributed generation and storage enables collection of energy from many sources and may lower environmental impacts and improve security of supply             historically  central plants have been an integral part of the electric grid  in which large generating facilities are specifically located either close to resources or otherwise located far from populated load centers  these  in turn  supply the traditional transmission and distribution  t d  grid that distributes bulk power to load centers and from there to consumers  these were developed when the costs of transporting fuel and integrating generating technologies into populated areas far exceeded the cost of developing t d facilities and tariffs  central plants are usually designed to take advantage of available economies of scale in a site specific manner  and are built as  one off   custom projects     these economies of scale began to fail in the late     s and  by the start of the   st century  central plants could arguably no longer deliver competitively cheap and reliable electricity to more remote customers through the grid  because the plants had come to cost less than the grid and had become so reliable that nearly all power failures originated in the grid citation needed thus  the grid had become the main driver of remote customers  power costs and power quality problems  which became more acute as digital equipment required extremely reliable electricity    efficiency gains no longer come from increasing generating capacity  but from smaller units located closer to sites of demand       for example  coal power plants are built away from cities to prevent their heavy air pollution from affecting the populace  in addition  such plants are often built near collieries to minimize the cost of transporting coal  hydroelectric plants are by their nature limited to operating at sites with sufficient water flow     low pollution is a crucial advantage of combined cycle plants that burn natural gas  the low pollution permits the plants to be near enough to a city to provide district heating and cooling     distributed energy resources are mass produced  small  and less site specific  their development arose out of     capital markets have come to realize that right sized resources  for individual customers  distribution substations  or microgrids  are able to offer important but little known economic advantages over central plants  smaller units offered greater economies from mass production than big ones could gain through unit size  these increased value due to improvements in financial risk  engineering flexibility  security  and environmental quality of these resources can often more than offset their apparent cost disadvantages   dg  vis   vis central plants  must be justified on a life cycle basis   unfortunately  many of the direct  and virtually all of the indirect  benefits of dg are not captured within traditional utility cash flow accounting      while the levelized generation cost of distributed generation  dg  is more expensive than conventional sources on a kwh basis  this does not consider negative aspects of conventional fuels  the additional premium for dg is rapidly declining as demand increases and technology progresses citation needed and sufficient and reliable demand may bring economies of scale  innovation  competition  and more flexible financing  that could make dg clean energy part of a more diversified future citation needed    distributed generation reduces the amount of energy lost in transmitting electricity because the electricity is generated very near where it is used  perhaps even in the same building  this also reduces the size and number of power lines that must be constructed     typical der systems in a feed in tariff  fit  scheme have low maintenance  low pollution and high efficiencies  in the past  these traits required dedicated operating engineers and large complex plants to reduce pollution  however  modern embedded systems can provide these traits with automated operation and renewables  such as sunlight  wind and geothermal  this reduces the size of power plant that can show a profit     grid parity occurs when an alternative energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost  lcoe  that is less than or equal to the end consumer s retail price  reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support  since the     s  grid parity for solar and wind has become a reality in a growing number of markets  including australia  several european countries  and some states in the u s      distributed energy resource  der  systems are small scale power generation or storage technologies  typically in the range of  xa kw to       xa kw   used to provide an alternative to or an enhancement of the traditional electric power system  der systems typically are characterized by high initial capital costs per kilowatt   der systems also serve as storage device and are often called distributed energy storage systems  dess        distributed cogeneration sources use steam turbines  natural gas fired fuel cells  microturbines or reciprocating engines   to turn generators  the hot exhaust is then used for space or water heating  or to drive an absorptive chiller      for cooling such as air conditioning  in addition to natural gas based schemes  distributed energy projects can also include other renewable or low carbon fuels including biofuels  biogas  landfill gas  sewage gas  coal bed methane  syngas and associated petroleum gas       delta ee consultants stated in      that with     of global sales the fuel cell micro combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in                units where sold in japan in      overall within the ene farm project  with a lifetime of around        hours  for pem fuel cell units  which shut down at night  this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years    for a price of         before installation    for      a state subsidy for        units is in place       in addition  molten carbonate fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cells using natural gas  such as the ones from fuelcell energy and the bloom energy server  or waste to energy processes such as the gate   energy system are used as a distributed energy resource     photovoltaics  by far the most important solar technology for distributed generation of solar power  uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity  it is a fast growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years  pv systems range from distributed  residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations  to large  centralized utility scale photovoltaic power stations     the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon  while thin film solar cell technology accounts for about    percent of global photovoltaic deployment          in recent years  pv technology has improved its sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency  reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time  epbt  and levelised cost of electricity  lcoe   and has reached grid parity in at least    different markets in            as most renewable energy sources and unlike coal and nuclear  solar pv is variable and non dispatchable  but has no fuel costs  operating pollution  mining safety or operating safety issues  it produces peak power around local noon each day and its capacity factor is around    percent       another source is small wind turbines  these have low maintenance  and low pollution  however as with solar  wind energy is variable and non dispatchable  construction costs are higher        w        per watt than large power plants  except in very windy areas  wind towers and generators have substantial insurable liabilities caused by high winds  but good operating safety  in some areas of the us there may also be property tax costs involved with wind turbines that are not offset by incentives or accelerated depreciation    wind also tends to complement solar  days without sun tend to be windy  and vice versa citation needed many distributed generation sites combine wind power and solar power such as slippery rock university  which can be monitored onlinedead link     hydroelectricity is the most widely used form of renewable energy and its potential has already been explored to a large extend or is compromised due to issues such as environmental impacts on fisheries  and increased demand for recreational access  however  using modern   st century technology  such as wave power  can make large amounts of new hydropower capacity available  with minor environmental impact     modular and scalable next generation kinetic energy turbines can be deployed in arrays to serve the needs on a residential  commercial  industrial  municipal or even regional scale  microhydro kinetic generators neither require dams nor impoundments  as they utilize the kinetic energy of water motion  either waves or flow  no construction is needed on the shoreline or sea bed  which minimizes environmental impacts to habitats and simplifies the permitting process  such power generation also has minimal environmental impact and non traditional microhydro applications can be tethered to existing construction such as docks  piers  bridge abutments  or similar structures       municipal solid waste  msw  and natural waste  such as sewage sludge  food waste and animal manure will decompose and discharge methane containing gas that can be collected and used as fuel in gas turbines or micro turbines to produce electricity as a distributed energy resource  additionally  a california based company  gate   energy partners  inc  has developed a process that transforms natural waste materials  such as sewage sludge  into biofuel that can be combusted to power a steam turbine that produces power  this power can be used in lieu of grid power at the waste source  such as a treatment plant  farm or dairy      a distributed energy resource is not limited to the generation of electricity but may also include a device to store distributed energy  de     distributed energy storage systems  dess  applications include several types of battery  pumped hydro  compressed air  and thermal energy storage          an advanced flywheel energy storage  fes  stores the electricity generated from distributed ressources in the form of angular kinetic energy by accelerating a rotor  flywheel  to a very high speed of about        to over        rpm in a vacuum enclosure  flywheels can respond quickly as they store and feed back electricity into the grid in a matter of minutes         future generations of electric vehicles may have the ability to deliver power from the battery in a vehicle to grid into the grid when needed    an electric vehicle network has the potential to serve as a dess          common battery technologies used in today s pv systems include  the valve regulated lead acid battery  lead acid battery   nickel cadmium and lithium ion batteries  compared to the other types  lead acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density  however  due to their high reliability  low self discharge      per year  as well as low investment and maintenance costs  they are currently the predominant technology used in small scale  residential pv systems  as lithium ion batteries are still being developed and about     times as expensive as lead acid batteries  furthermore  as storage devices for pv systems are used stationary  the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead acid batteries are not as critical as for electric vehicles           other rechargeable batteries that are considered for distributed pv systems include  sodium sulfur and vanadium redox batteries  two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery  respectively         for reasons of reliability  distributed generation resources would be interconnected to the same transmission grid as central stations  various technical and economic issues occur in the integration of these resources into a grid  technical problems arise in the areas of power quality  voltage stability  harmonics  reliability  protection  and control    behavior of protective devices on the grid must be examined for all combinations of distributed and central station generation    a large scale deployment of distributed generation may affect grid wide functions such as frequency control and allocation of reserves    as a result smart grid functions  virtual power plants and grid energy storage such as power to gas stations are added to the grid     cogenerators are also more expensive per watt than central generators citation needed they find favor because most buildings already burn fuels  and the cogeneration can extract more value from the fuel   local production has no electricity transportation losses on long distance power lines or energy losses from the joule effect in transformers where in general       of the energy is lost    see also cost of electricity by source      some larger installations utilize combined cycle generation  usually this consists of a gas turbine whose exhaust boils water for a steam turbine in a rankine cycle  the condenser of the steam cycle provides the heat for space heating or an absorptive chiller  combined cycle plants with cogeneration have the highest known thermal efficiencies  often exceeding         in countries with high pressure gas distribution  small turbines can be used to bring the gas pressure to domestic levels whilst extracting useful energy  if the uk were to implement this countrywide an additional    xa gwe would become available   note that the energy is already being generated elsewhere to provide the high initial gas pressure   this method simply distributes the energy via a different route      a microgrid is a localized grouping of electricity generation  energy storage  and loads that normally operates connected to a traditional centralized grid  macrogrid   this single point of common coupling with the macrogrid can be disconnected  the microgrid can then function autonomously    generation and loads in a microgrid are usually interconnected at low voltage  from the point of view of the grid operator  a connected microgrid can be controlled as if it were one entity     microgrid generation resources can include fuel cells  wind  solar  or other energy sources  the multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power  produced heat from generation sources such as microturbines could be used for local process heating or space heating  allowing flexible trade off between the needs for heat and electric power     micro grids were proposed in the wake of the july      india blackout       gtm research forecasts microgrid capacity in the united states will exceed     gigawatts by            der systems may include the following devices technologies     in      colorado enacted a law requiring that by      that    of the power generated in colorado utilize distributed generation of some sort
