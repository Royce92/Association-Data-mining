 a client is a piece of computer hardware or software that accesses a service made available by a server  the server is often  but not always  on another computer system  in which case the client accesses the service by way of a network   the term applies to programs or devices that are part of a client server model             a client is a computer program that  as part of its operation  relies on sending a request to another computer program  which may or may not be located on another computer   for example  web browsers are clients that connect to web servers and retrieve web pages for display  email clients retrieve email from mail servers  online chat uses a variety of clients  which vary depending on the chat protocol being used  multiplayer video games or online video games may run as a client on each computer  the term  client  may also be applied to computers or devices that run the client software or users that use the client software     a client is part of a client server model  which is still used today  clients and servers may be computer programs run on the same machine and connect via inter process communication techniques  combined with internet sockets  programs may connect to a service operating on a possibly remote system through the internet protocol suite  servers wait for potential clients to initiate connections that they may accept     the term was first applied to devices that were not capable of running their own stand alone programs  but could interact with remote computers via a network  these dumb terminals were clients of the time sharing mainframe computer     in one classification  client computers and devices are either fat clients  thin clients  or hybrid clients     a fat client  also known as a rich client or thick client  is a client that performs the bulk of any data processing operations itself  and does not necessarily rely on the server  the personal computer is a common example of a fat client  because of its relatively large set of features and capabilities and its light reliance upon a server  for example  a computer running a cad program  such as autocad or catia  that ultimately shares the result of its work on a network is a fat client     common development tools for rich clients include delphi  netbeans and visual studio     a thin client is a minimal sort of client  thin clients use the resources of the host computer  a thin client generally only presents processed data provided by an application server  which performs the bulk of any required data processing  a device using web application  such as office web apps  is a thin client     programming environments for thin clients include javascript  asp net  jsp  ruby on rails  django  php and others     a hybrid client is a mixture of the above two client models  similar to a fat client  it processes locally  but relies on the server for storing persistent data  this approach offers features from both the fat client  multimedia support  high performance  and the thin client  high manageability  flexibility   a device running the video game diablo iii is an example of hybrid client
