 html  is a core technology markup language of the internet used for structuring and presenting content for the world wide web  as of october     update this is the final and complete  fifth revision of the html standard of the world wide web consortium  w c    the previous version  html    was standardised in          its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices  web browsers  parsers  etc    html  is intended to subsume not only htmlxa    but also xhtmlxa   and dom level   html      following its immediate predecessors htmlxa      and xhtmlxa      html  is a response to the fact that the html and xhtml in common use on the world wide web are a mixture of features introduced by various specifications  along with those introduced by software products such as web browsers  those established by common practice   it is also an attempt to define a single markup language that can be written in either html or xhtml  it includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations  it extends  improves and rationalises the markup available for documents  and introduces markup and application programming interfaces  apis  for complex web applications   for the same reasons  html  is also a potential candidate for cross platform mobile applications  many features of html  have been built with the consideration of being able to run on low powered devices such as smartphones and tablets  in december       research firm strategy analytics forecast sales of html  compatible phones would top   billion in           in particular  html  adds many new syntactic features  these include the new  video    audio  and  canvas  elements  as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics  svg  content  replacing generic  object  tags   and mathml for mathematical formulas  these features are designed to make it easy to include and handle multimedia and graphical content on the web without having to resort to proprietary plugins and apis  other new elements  such as  section    article    header  and  nav   are designed to enrich the semantic content of documents  new attributes have been introduced for the same purpose  while some elements and attributes have been removed  some elements  such as  a    cite  and  menu  have been changed  redefined or standardized  the apis and document object model  dom  are no longer afterthoughts  but are fundamental parts of the html  specification   html  also defines in some detail the required processing for invalid documents so that syntax errors will be treated uniformly by all conforming browsers and other user agents              the web hypertext application technology working group  whatwg  began work on the new standard in       at that time  htmlxa      had not been updated since        and the world wide web consortium  w c  was focusing future developments on xhtmlxa      in       the w c allowed the xhtml     working group s charter to expire and decided not to renew it  w c and whatwg are currently working together on the development of html        while some features of html  are often compared to adobe flash  the two technologies are very different  both include features for playing audio and video within web pages  and for using scalable vector graphics  html  on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivityxa   it must be supplemented with css  or javascript  there are many flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in html   see comparison of html  and flash     although html  has been well known among web developers for years  its interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media around april              after apple inc s then ceo steve jobs issued a public letter titled  thoughts on flash  where he concludes that  flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content  and that  new open standards created in the mobile era  such as html   will win     this sparked a debate in web development circles where some suggested that while html  provides enhanced functionality  developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other functionality differences between html  and flash    in early november       adobe announced that it will discontinue development of flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using html        the mozilla foundation and opera software presented a position paper at a world wide web consortium  w c  workshop in june         focusing on developing technologies that are backward compatible with existing browsers    including an initial draft specification of web forms      the workshop concluded with a vote    for     against  for continuing work on html    immediately after the workshop  the web hypertext application technology working group  whatwg  was formed to start work based upon that position paper  and a second draft  web applications      was also announced    the two specifications were later merged to form html     the html  specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new html working group of the w c in          whatwg published the first public working draft of the specification on    january         parts of html  have been implemented in browsers despite the whole specification not yet having reached final recommendation status     on    february       the w c extended the charter of its html working group with clear milestones for html   in may       the working group advanced html  to  last call   an invitation to communities inside and outside w c to confirm the technical soundness of the specification  the w c is developing a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full specification by       which is now the target date for recommendation    in january       the whatwg renamed its  html   living standard to  html   the w c nevertheless continues its project to release html        in july       whatwg and w c decided on a degree of separation  w c will continue the html  specification work  focusing on a single definitive standard  which is considered as a  snapshot  by whatwg  the whatwg organization will continue its work with html  as a  living standard   the concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved  new features can be added but functionality will not be removed       in december       w c designated html  as a candidate recommendation    the criterion for advancement to w c recommendation is  two      complete and fully interoperable implementations          in september       w c moved html  to proposed recommendation       on    october       html  was released as a stable w c recommendation    meaning the specification process is complete      in september       the w c proposed a plan   to release a stable html  recommendation by the end of       released in october  and an html     specification recommendation by the end of          the combined timelines for html      html     and html         the w c proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress  meaning identifying specific features  either proposed or already existing in the spec  and advancing them as separate specifications  some technologies that were originally defined in html  itself are now defined in separate specifications     after the standardization of the html  specification in october         the core vocabulary and features are being extended in four ways    some parts of html  that have been removed from the original html  specification are standardized separately as modules  apis  such as microdata and canvas  technical specifications introduced as html  extensions such as polyglot markup are also standardized as modules  some w c specifications that have originally been separate specifications are adapted as html  extensions or features  as for example  svg  the specific features that would have slowed down the standardization of html  will be standardized as upcoming specifications such as html      html      and so on  html     is expected to be finalized in       and it is currently on the standardization track at the w c     html  introduces elements and attributes that reflect typical usage on modern websites  some of them are semantic replacements for common uses of generic block   div   and inline   span   elements  for example  nav   website navigation block    footer   usually referring to bottom of web page or to last lines of html code   or  audio  and  video  instead of  object         some deprecated elements from htmlxa      have been dropped  including purely presentational elements such as  font  and  center   whose effects have long been superseded by the more capable cascading style sheets    there is also a renewed emphasis on the importance of dom scripting  e g   javascript  in web behavior     the html  syntax is no longer based on sgml     despite the similarity of its markup  it has  however  been designed to be backward compatible with common parsing of older versions of html  it comes with a new introductory line that looks like an sgml document type declaration    doctype html   which triggers the standards compliant rendering mode    since   january       html  also includes web forms      a previously separate whatwg specification         in addition to specifying markup  html  specifies scripting application programming interfaces  apis  that can be used with javascript    existing document object model  dom  interfaces are extended and de facto features documented  there are also new apis  such as     not all of the above technologies are included in the w c html  specification  though they are in the whatwg html specification    some related technologies  which are not part of either the w c html  or the whatwg html specification  are as follows  the w c publishes specifications for these separately     html  cannot provide animation within web pages  additional javascript or css  functionality is necessary for animating html elements  animation is also possible using javascript and html    not in citation given  and within svg elements through smil  although browser support of the latter remains uneven as of          xml documents must be served with an xml internet media type  often called  mime type   such as application xhtml xml or application xml    and must conform to strict  well formed syntax of xml  xhtml  is simply an xml serialized html  data  e g  not having any unclosed tags   sent with one of xml media types  html that has been written to conform to both the html and xhtml specifications   and which will therefore produce the same dom tree whether parsed as html or xml   is termed  polyglot markup        html  is designed so that old browsers can safely ignore new html  constructs   in contrast to html       the html  specification gives detailed rules for lexing and parsing  with the intent that different compliant browsers will produce the same result in the case of incorrect syntax    although html  now defines a consistent behavior for  tag soup  documents  those documents are not regarded as conforming to the html  standard       according to a report released on    september          of the world s top     web sites were using html xa   the adoption led by search engines and social networks    another report released in august      has shown that     of the fortune     u s  companies implemented html  on their corporate websites       as of       html   is at least partially supported by most popular layout engines     the following is a cursory list of differences and some specific examples     dev w  org provides the latest editors draft of  html  differences from html       which provides a complete outline of additions  removals and changes between html  and html       on    january       the w c introduced a logo to represent the use of or interest in html   unlike other badges previously issued by the w c  it does not imply validity or conformance to a certain standard  as of   april       this logo is official       when initially presenting it to the public  the w c announced the html  logo as a  general purpose visual identity for a broad set of open web technologies  including html   css  svg  woff  and others     some web standard advocates  including the web standards project  criticised that definition of  html   as an umbrella term  pointing out the blurring of terminology and the potential for miscommunication    three days later  the w c responded to community feedback and changed the logo s definition  dropping the enumeration of related technologies    the w c then said the logo  represents html   the cornerstone for modern web applications        industrial players including the bbc  google  microsoft  and netflix have been lobbying for the inclusion of encrypted media extensions  eme             a form of digital rights management  drm   into the html  standard  as of the end of      and the beginning of          organisations   including the free software foundation   have started a campaign against including digital rights management in the html  standard      however in late september       the w c html working group decided that encrypted media extensions  a form of drm  was  in scope  and will potentially be included in the html     standard      whatwg s  html living standard  continued to be developed without drm enabled proposals       manu sporny  a member of the w c  said that eme will not solve the problem it s supposed to address    opponents point out that eme itself is just an architecture for a drm plug in mechanism       the initial enablers for drm in html  were google   and microsoft    supporters also include adobe    on    may       mozilla announced plans to support eme in firefox  the last major browser to avoid drm      calling it  a difficult and uncomfortable step   andreas gal of mozilla explained that future versions of firefox would remain open source but ship with a sandbox designed to run a content decryption module developed by adobe    while promising to  work on alternative solutions   mitchell baker stated that mozilla s refusal to implement eme would accomplish little more than convincing many users to switch browsers    this decision was condemned by cory doctorow and the free software foundation
