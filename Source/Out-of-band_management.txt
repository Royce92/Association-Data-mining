 in computer networks  out of band management involves the use of a dedicated channel for managing network devices  this allows the network operator to establish trust boundaries in accessing the management function to apply it to network resources  it also can be used to ensure management connectivity  including the ability to determine the status of any network component  independent of the status of other in band network components     in computing  one form of out of band management is sometimes called lights out management  or lom  and involves the use of a dedicated management channel for device maintenance  it allows a system administrator to monitor and manage servers and other network attached equipment by remote control regardless of whether the machine is powered on  or if an operating system is installed or functional     by contrast  in band management like vnc or ssh is based on in band connectivity and software that must be installed on the remote system being managed and only works after the operating system has been booted  this solution may be cheaper  but in computing it does not allow access to firmware  bios or uefi  settings  does not make it possible to reinstall the operating system remotely  and it cannot be used to fix problems that prevent the system from booting  in networking  it does not allow management of remote network components independently of the current status of other network components     both in band and out of band  oob  management are usually done through a network connection  but an out of band management card can use a physically separated network connector if preferred  a remote management card usually has at least partially independent power supply  and can power the main machine on and off through the network     this article focuses mainly on out of band management of servers  but also many  if not most  network devices offer out of band managementcitation needed  modular blade systems with dedicated management modules often offer a dedicated oob ethernet port or lights out management port             a complete remote management system allows  remote reboot  shutdown  powering on  hardware sensor monitoring  fan speed  power voltages  chassis intrusion  etc    broadcasting of video output to remote terminals and receiving of input from remote keyboard and mouse  kvm over ip   it also can access local media like a dvd drive  or disk images  from the remote machine  if necessary  this allows one to perform remote installation of the operating system  remote management can be used to adjust bios settings that may not be accessible after the operating system has already booted  settings of hardware raid or ram clocking can also be adjusted as the management card needs no hard drives or main memory to operate     as management via a serial port has traditionally been important on servers  a complete remote management system also allows one to talk with the server through this port  sol console      as sending monitor output through the network is bandwidth intensive  cards like megarac use built in video compression   versions of vnc are often used in implementing this    devices like dell drac also have a slot for a memory card where an administrator may keep server related information independently from the main hard drive     the remote system can be accessed either through an ssh command line interface  specialized client software  or through various web browser based solutions   client software is usually optimized to manage multiple systems easily     there are also various scaled down versions  up to devices that only allow remote reboot by power cycling the server  this helps if the operating system hangs but only needs a reboot to recover     remote management can be enabled on many computers  not necessarily only servers  by adding a remote management card  while some cards only support a limited list of motherboards   newer server motherboards often have built in remote management and need no separate management card     internally  ethernet based out of band management can either utilize a dedicated separate ethernet connection  or some kind of traffic multiplexing can be performed on the system s regular ethernet connection  that way  a common ethernet connection becomes shared between the computer s operating system and the integrated baseboard management controller  bmc   usually by configuring the network interface controller  nic  to perform remote management control protocol  rmcp  ports filtering  use a separate mac address  or to utilize virtual lan  vlan  tagging  thus  out of band nature of the management traffic is ensured in a shared connection scenario as the system configures the nic to extract the management traffic from the incoming traffic flow on the hardware level  and to route it to the bmc before reaching the host and its operating system      another  older  version of out of band management is a layout involving availability of a separate network which allows network administrators to get command line interface  cli  access over console ports of network equipment  even when those devices are not forwarding any payload traffic     if a location has several network devices  a terminal server can provide access to different console ports for direct cli access  in case there is only one or just a few network devices  some of them provide aux ports making it possible to connect a dial in modem for direct cli access  the mentioned terminal server can often be accessed via a separate network that does not use managed switches and routers for a connection to the central site  and or it has a modem connected via dial in access through pots or isdn
