their duties to design or write new application software  however  sysadmins must understand the behavior of software in order to deploy it and to troubleshoot problems  and generally know several programming languages used for scripting or automation of routine tasks     particularly when dealing with internet facing or business critical systems  a sysadmin must have a strong grasp of computer security  this includes not merely deploying software patches  but also preventing break ins and other security problems with preventive measures  in some organizations  computer security
