 a blade server is a stripped down server computer with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy  whereas a standard rack mount server can function with  at least  a power cord and network cable  blade servers have many components removed to save space  minimize power consumption and other considerations  while still having all the functional components to be considered a computer clarification needed  a blade enclosure  which can hold multiple blade servers  provides services such as power  cooling  networking  various interconnects and management  together  blades and the blade enclosure form a blade system  although bladesystem from hewlett packard is a specific product name   different blade providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the blade itself  and in the blade system altogether     in a standard server rack configuration  one rack unit or  u    inches     xa mm  wide and      inches    xa mm  tall defines the minimum possible size of any equipment  the principal benefit and justification of blade computing relates to lifting this restriction so as to reduce size requirements  the most common computer rack form factor is   u high  which limits the number of discrete computer devices directly mountable in a rack to    components  blades do not have this limitation  as of     update  densities of up to     servers per blade system  or      servers per rack  are achievable with blade systems              enclosure  or chassis  performs many of the non core computing services found in most computers  non blade systems typically use bulky  hot and space inefficient components  and may duplicate these across many computers that may or may not perform at capacity  by locating these services in one place and sharing them between the blade computers  the overall utilization becomes higher  the specifics of which services are provided may vary by vendor     computers operate over a range of dc voltages  but utilities deliver power as ac  and at higher voltages than required within computers  converting this current requires one or more power supply units  or psus   to ensure that the failure of one power source does not affect the operation of the computer  even entry level servers may have redundant power supplies  again adding to the bulk and heat output of the design     the blade enclosure s power supply provides a single power source for all blades within the enclosure  this single power source may come as a power supply in the enclosure or as a dedicated separate psu supplying dc to multiple enclosures    this setup reduces the number of psus required to provide a resilient power supply     the popularity of blade servers  and their own appetite for power  has led to an increase in the number of rack mountable uninterruptible power supply  or ups  units  including units targeted specifically towards blade servers  such as the bladeups      during operation  electrical and mechanical components produce heat  which a system must dissipate to ensure the proper functioning of its components  most blade enclosures  like most computing systems  remove heat by using fans     a frequently underestimated problem when designing high performance computer systems involves the conflict between the amount of heat a system generates and the ability of its fans to remove the heat  the blade s shared power and cooling means that it does not generate as much heat as traditional servers  newerupdate blade enclosures feature variable speed fans and control logic  or even liquid cooling systems   that adjust to meet the system s cooling requirements     at the same time  the increased density of blade server configurations can still result in higher overall demands for cooling with racks populated at over     full  this is especially true with early generation blades  in absolute terms  a fully populated rack of blade servers is likely to require more cooling capacity than a fully populated rack of standard  u servers  this is because one can fit up to     blade servers in the same rack that will only hold     u rack mount servers      blade servers generally include integrated or optional network interface controllers for ethernet or host adapters for fibre channel storage systems or converged network adapter to combine storage and data via one fibre channel over ethernet interface  in many blades at least one interface is embedded on the motherboard and extra interfaces can be added using mezzanine cards     a blade enclosure can provide individual external ports to which each network interface on a blade will connect  alternatively  a blade enclosure can aggregate network interfaces into interconnect devices  such as switches  built into the blade enclosure or in networking blades       while computers typically use hard disks to store operating systems  applications and data  these are not necessarily required locally  many storage connection methods  e g  firewire  sata  e sata  scsi  sas das  fc and iscsi  are readily moved outside the server  though not all are used in enterprise level installations  implementing these connection interfaces within the computer presents similar challenges to the networking interfaces  indeed iscsi runs over the network interface   and similarly these can be removed from the blade and presented individually or aggregated either on the chassis or through other blades     the ability to boot the blade from a storage area network  san  allows for an entirely disk free blade  an example of which implementation is the intel modular server system     since blade enclosures provide a standard method for delivering basic services to computer devices  other types of devices can also utilize blade enclosures  blades providing switching  routing  storage  san and fibre channel access can slot into the enclosure to provide these services to all members of the enclosure     systems administrators can use storage blades where a requirement exists for additional local storage           blade servers function well for specific purposes such as web hosting  virtualization  and cluster computing  individual blades are typically hot swappable  as users deal with larger and more diverse workloads  they add more processing power  memory and i o bandwidth to blade servers     although blade server technology in theory allows for open  cross vendor solutions  the stage of development of the technology as of     update is such that users encounter fewer problems when using blades  racks and blade management tools from the same vendor     eventual standardization of the technology might result in more choices for consumers      as of     update increasing numbers of third party software vendors have started to enter this growing field       blade servers do not  however  provide the answer to every computing problem  one can view them as a form of productized server farm that borrows from mainframe packaging  cooling  and power supply technology  very large computing tasks may still require server farms of blade servers  and because of blade servers  high power density  can suffer even more acutely from the heating  ventilation  and air conditioning problems that affect large conventional server farms     developers first placed complete microcomputers on cards and packaged them in standard    inch racks in the     s  soon after the introduction of   bit microprocessors  this architecture was used in the industrial process control industry as an alternative to minicomputer based control systems  early models stored programs in eprom and were limited to a single function with a small real time executive     the vmebus architecture  ca        defined a computer interface which included implementation of a board level computer installed in a chassis backplane with multiple slots for pluggable boards to provide i o  memory  or additional computing     in the     s  the pci industrial computer manufacturers group picmg developed a chassis blade structure for the then emerging peripheral component interconnect bus pci which is called compactpci  common among these chassis based computers was the fact that the entire chassis was a single system  while a chassis might include multiple computing elements to provide the desired level of performance and redundancy  there was always one master board in charge  coordinating the operation of the entire system     picmg expanded the compactpci specification with the use of standard ethernet connectivity between boards across the backplane  the picmg      compactpci packet switching backplane specification was adopted in sept         this provided the first open architecture for a multi server chassis  picmg followed with the larger and more feature rich advancedtca specification  targeting the telecom industry s need for a high availability and dense computing platform with extended product life      years   while advancedtca system and boards typically sell for higher prices than blade servers  advancedtca suppliers claim that low operating expenses and total cost of ownership can make advancedtca based solutions a cost effective alternative for many building blocks of the next generation telecom network     the first commercialized blade server architecturecitation needed was invented by christopher hipp and david kirkeby  and their patent  us        xa   was assigned to houston based rlx technologies    rlx  which consisted primarily of former compaq computer corporation employees  including hipp and kirkeby  shipped its first commercial blade server in         rlx was acquired by hewlett packard in            the name blade server appeared when a card included the processor  memory  i o and non volatile program storage  flash memory or small hard disk s    this allowed manufacturers to package a complete server  with its operating system and applications  on a single card   board   blade  these blades could then operate independently within a common chassis  doing the work of multiple separate server boxes more efficiently  in addition to the most obvious benefit of this packaging  less space consumption   additional efficiency benefits have become clear in power  cooling  management  and networking due to the pooling or sharing of common infrastructure to support the entire chassis  rather than providing each of these on a per server box basis     in       research firm idc identified the major players in the blade market as hp  ibm  cisco  and dell    other companies selling blade servers include avadirect  oracle  egenera  supermicro  hitachi  fujitsu  rackable  hybrid blade   cirrascale and intel     though many independent professional computer manufacturers such as supermicro offer blade solutions  the blade server market continues to be dominated by large public it companies such as cisco  which achieved no    position on the blade server market with     share by revenue in americas in the first quarter of         the remaining prominent brands in the blade server market are hp  dell

servers in each chassis  up to    chassis in a domain  all managed by a heavily modified nexus  k switch  rebranded as a fabric interconnect  which converge computing and networking  and manages the whole system as a single entity    hp s current line consists of two chassis models  the c     which holds up to   half height proliant line blades  also available in tower form   and the c        u
