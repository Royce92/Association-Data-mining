 disaster recovery  dr  involves a set of policies and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human induced disaster   disaster recovery focuses on the it or technology systems supporting critical business functions   as opposed to business continuity  which involves keeping all essential aspects of a business functioning despite significant disruptive events  disaster recovery is therefore a subset of business continuity              disaster recovery developed in the mid  to late     s as computer center managers began to recognize the dependence of their organizations on their computer systems  at that time  most systems were batch oriented mainframes which in many cases could be down for a number of days before significant damage would be done to the organization      as awareness of the potential business disruption that would follow an it related disaster  the disaster recovery industry developed to provide backup computer centers  with sun information systems  which later became sungard availability systems  becoming the first major us commercial hot site vendor  established in      in philadelphia      during the     s and   s  customer awareness and industry both grew rapidly  driven by the advent of open systems and real time processing which increased the dependence of organizations on their it systems  regulations mandating business continuity and disaster recovery plans for organizations in various sectors of the economy  imposed by the authorities and by business partners  increased the demand and led to the availability of commercial disaster recovery services  including mobile data centers delivered to a suitable recovery location by truck     with the rapid growth of the internet through the late     s and into the     s  organizations of all sizes became further dependent on the continuous availability of their it systems  with some organizations setting objectives of         or   nines           availability of critical systems   this increasing dependence on it systems  as well as increased awareness from large scale disasters such as tsunami  earthquake  flood  and volcanic eruption  spawned disaster recovery related products and services  ranging from high availability solutions to hot site facilities  improved networking meant critical it services could be served remotely  hence on site recovery became less important     the meteoric rise of cloud computing since      continues that trend  nowadays  it matters even less where computing services are physically served  just so long as the network itself is sufficiently reliable  a separate issue  and less of a concern since modern networks are highly resilient by design    recovery as a service   raas  is one of the security features or benefits of cloud computing being promoted by the cloud security alliance      disasters can be classified into two broad categories  the first is natural disasters such as floods  hurricanes  tornadoes or earthquakes  while preventing a natural disaster is very difficult  risk management measures such as avoiding disaster prone situations and good planning can help  the second category is man made disasters  such as hazardous material spills  infrastructure failure  bio terrorism  and disastrous it bugs or failed change implementations  in these instances  surveillance  testing and mitigation planning are invaluable     recent research supports the idea that implementing a more holistic pre disaster planning approach is more cost effective in the long run  every    spent on hazard mitigation such as a disaster recovery plan saves society    in response and recovery costs      as it systems have become increasingly critical to the smooth operation of a company  and arguably the economy as a whole  the importance of ensuring the continued operation of those systems  and their rapid recovery  has increased   for example  of companies that had a major loss of business data      never reopen and     close within two years    as a result  preparation for continuation or recovery of systems needs to be taken very seriously  this involves a significant investment of time and money with the aim of ensuring minimal losses in the event of a disruptive event       control measures are steps or mechanisms that can reduce or eliminate various threats for organizations  different types of measures can be included in disaster recovery plan  drp      disaster recovery planning is a subset of a larger process known as business continuity planning and includes planning for resumption of applications  data  hardware  electronic communications  such as networking  and other it infrastructure  a business continuity plan  bcp  includes planning for non it related aspects such as key personnel  facilities  crisis communication and reputation protection  and should refer to the disaster recovery plan  drp  for it related infrastructure recovery   continuity     it disaster recovery control measures can be classified into the following three types     good disaster recovery plan measures dictate that these three types of controls be documented and exercised regularly using so called  dr tests      prior to selecting a disaster recovery strategy  a disaster recovery planner first refers to their organization s business continuity plan which should indicate the key metrics of recovery point objective  rpo  and recovery time objective  rto  for various business processes  such as the process to run payroll  generate an order  etc    the metrics specified for the business processes are then mapped to the underlying it systems and infrastructure that support those processes       incomplete rtos and rpos can quickly derail a disaster recovery plan  every item in the dr plan requires a defined recovery point and time objective  as failure to create them may lead to significant problems that can extend the disaster s impact    once the rto and rpo metrics have been mapped to it infrastructure  the dr planner can determine the most suitable recovery strategy for each system  the organization ultimately sets the it budget and therefore the rto and rpo metrics need to fit with the available budget  while most business unit heads would like zero data loss and zero time loss  the cost associated with that level of protection may make the desired high availability solutions impractical  a cost benefit analysis often dictates which disaster recovery measures are implemented     some of the most common strategies for data protection include           in many cases  an organization may elect to use an outsourced disaster recovery provider to provide a stand by site and systems rather than using their own remote facilities  increasingly via cloud computing     in addition to preparing for the need to recover systems  organizations also implement precautionary measures with the objective of preventing a disaster in the first place  these may include
