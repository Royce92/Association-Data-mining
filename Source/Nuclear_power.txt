 nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactors to release nuclear energy   and thereby generate electricity  the term includes nuclear fission  nuclear decay and nuclear fusion  presently  the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear energy in the direct service of humankind  with nuclear decay processes  primarily in the form of geothermal energy  and radioisotope thermoelectric generators  in niche uses making up the rest  nuclear  fission  power stations  excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors  provided     of the world s electricity in       the share of the world s primary energy supply  which refers to the heat production without the conversion efficiency of about   xa    was about        its share of the global final energy consumption  actually useful energy  i e  electric power  is below    xa        in       the iaea report that there are    xa operational nuclear power reactors   in   xa countries   although not every reactor is producing electricity   in addition  there are approximately     naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation  powered by some     reactors     as of       attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions  excluding natural fusion power sources such as the sun  remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research  more than    years after the first attempts  commercial fusion power production remains unlikely before            there is an ongoing debate about nuclear power        proponents  such as the world nuclear association  the iaea and environmentalists for nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a safe  sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions    opponents  such as greenpeace international and nirs  contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment           nuclear power plant accidents include the chernobyl disaster         fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster         and the three mile island accident           there have also been some nuclear submarine accidents        in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated  analysis has determined that nuclear power has caused less fatalities per unit of energy generated than the other major sources of energy generation  energy production from coal  petroleum  natural gas and hydropower has caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accident effects            however  the economic costs of nuclear power accidents is high  and meltdowns can render areas uninhabitable for very long periods  the human costs of evacuations of affected populations and lost livelihoods is also significant         along with other sustainable energy sources  nuclear power is a low carbon power generation method of producing electricity  with an analysis of the literature on its total life cycle emission intensity finding that it is similar to other renewable sources in a comparison of greenhouse gas ghg  emissions per unit of energy generated    with this translating into  from the beginning of nuclear power station commercialization in the     s  having prevented the emission of approximately    gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gtco  eq  greenhouse gases  gases that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power stations       as of       according to the iaea  worldwide there were    civil nuclear power reactors under construction in    countries   approximately    of which in the peoples republic of china  prc   with the most recent nuclear power reactor  as of may       to be connected to the electrical grid  occurring on february          in hongyanhe nuclear power plant in the prc    in the usa  two new generation iii reactors are under construction at vogtle  u s  nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by       all at existing plants    in       four aging  uncompetitive  reactors were permanently closed         japan s      fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  which occurred in a reactor design from the     s  prompted a re examination of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries    germany decided to close all its reactors by       and italy has banned nuclear power    following fukushima  in      the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by                      in      nuclear power provided     of the world s electricity   in       the iaea reported there were    xa nuclear power reactors in operation in the world    operating in   xa countries   however  many have now ceased operation in the wake of the fukushima nuclear disaster while they are assessed for safety  in      worldwide nuclear output fell by       the largest decline on record  on the back of sharp declines in japan          and germany                since commercial nuclear energy began in the mid     s       was the first year that no new nuclear power plant was connected to the grid  although two were connected in              annual generation of nuclear power has been on a slight downward trend since       decreasing      in      to      twh with nuclear power meeting        of the world s electricity demand    one factor in the nuclear power percentage decrease since      has been the prolonged shutdown of large reactors at the kashiwazaki kariwa nuclear power plant in japan following the niigata chuetsu oki earthquake       the united states produces the most nuclear energy  with nuclear power providing       of the electricity it consumes  while france produces the highest percentage of its electrical energy from nuclear reactors     as of         in the european union as a whole  nuclear energy provides     of the electricity    nuclear energy policy differs among european union countries  and some  such as austria  estonia  ireland and italy  have no active nuclear power stations  in comparison  france has a large number of these plants  with    multi unit stations in current use     in the us  while the coal and gas electricity industry is projected to be worth     billion by       nuclear power generators are forecast to be worth     billion       many military and some civilian  such as some icebreaker  ships use nuclear marine propulsion  a form of nuclear propulsion    a few space vehicles have been launched using full fledged nuclear reactors     reactors belong to the soviet rorsat series and one was the american snap   a     international research is continuing into safety improvements such as passively safe plants    the use of nuclear fusion  and additional uses of process heat such as hydrogen production  in support of a hydrogen economy   for desalinating sea water  and for use in district heating systems     both fission and fusion appear promising for space propulsion applications  generating higher mission velocities with less reaction mass  this is due to the much higher energy density of nuclear reactions  some   orders of magnitude             times  more energetic than the chemical reactions which power the current generation of rockets     radioactive decay has been used on a relatively small scale  few kw   mostly to power space missions and experiments by using radioisotope thermoelectric generators such as those developed at idaho national laboratory     the pursuit of nuclear energy for electricity generation began soon after the discovery in the early   th century that radioactive elements  such as radium  released immense amounts of energy  according to the principle of mass energy equivalence  however  means of harnessing such energy was impractical  because intensely radioactive elements were  by their very nature  short lived  high energy release is correlated with short half lives   however  the dream of harnessing  atomic energy  was quite strong  even though it was dismissed by such fathers of nuclear physics like ernest rutherford as  moonshine     this situation  however  changed in the late     s  with the discovery of nuclear fission     in       james chadwick discovered the neutron    which was immediately recognized as a potential tool for nuclear experimentation because of its lack of an electric charge  experimentation with bombardment of materials with neutrons led fr d ric and ir ne joliot curie to discover induced radioactivity in       which allowed the creation of radium like elements at much less the price of natural radium    further work by enrico fermi in the     s focused on using slow neutrons to increase the effectiveness of induced radioactivity  experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons led fermi to believe he had created a new  transuranic element  which was dubbed hesperium       but in       german chemists otto hahn   and fritz strassmann  along with austrian physicist lise meitner   and meitner s nephew  otto robert frisch    conducted experiments with the products of neutron bombarded uranium  as a means of further investigating fermi s claims  they determined that the relatively tiny neutron split the nucleus of the massive uranium atoms into two roughly equal pieces  contradicting fermi    this was an extremely surprising result  all other forms of nuclear decay involved only small changes to the mass of the nucleus  whereas this process dubbed  fission  as a reference to biology involved a complete rupture of the nucleus  numerous scientists  including le  szil rd  who was one of the first  recognized that if fission reactions released additional neutrons  a self sustaining nuclear chain reaction could result  once this was experimentally confirmed and announced by fr d ric joliot curie in       scientists in many countries  including the united states  the united kingdom  france  germany  and the soviet union  petitioned their governments for support of nuclear fission research  just on the cusp of world war ii  for the development of a nuclear weapon       in the united states  where fermi and szil rd had both emigrated  this led to the creation of the first man made reactor  known as chicago pile    which achieved criticality on december          this work became part of the manhattan project  which made enriched uranium and built large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons  which were used on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki     unexpectedly high costs in the u s  nuclear weapons program  along with competition with the soviet union and a desire to spread democracy through the world  created     pressure on federal officials to develop a civilian nuclear power industry that could help justify the government s considerable expenditures     in       the pocketbook the atomic age heralded the untapped atomic power in everyday objects and depicted a future where fossil fuels would go unused  one science writer  david dietz  wrote that instead of filling the gas tank of your car two or three times a week  you will travel for a year on a pellet of atomic energy the size of a vitamin pill  glenn seaborg  who chaired the atomic energy commission  wrote  there will be nuclear powered earth to moon shuttles  nuclear powered artificial hearts  plutonium heated swimming pools for scuba divers  and much more   these overly optimistic predications remain unfulfilled       united kingdom  canada    and ussr proceeded over the course of the late     s and early     s  electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on december           at the ebr i experimental station near arco  idaho  which initially produced about    xa kw      work was also strongly researched in the us on nuclear marine propulsion  with a test reactor being developed by       eventually  the uss nautilus  the first nuclear powered submarine  would launch in          in       us president dwight eisenhower gave his  atoms for peace  speech at the united nations  emphasizing the need to develop  peaceful  uses of nuclear power quickly  this was followed by the      amendments to the atomic energy act which allowed rapid declassification of u s  reactor technology and encouraged development by the private sector  this involved a significant learning phase  with many early partial core meltdowns and accidents at experimental reactors and research facilities       on june           the ussr s obninsk nuclear power plant became the world s first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid  and produced around   megawatts of electric power         later in       lewis strauss  then chairman of the united states atomic energy commission  u s  aec  forerunner of the u s  nuclear regulatory commission and the united states department of energy  spoke of electricity in the future being  too cheap to meter     strauss was very likely referring to hydrogen fusion    which was secretly being developed as part of project sherwood at the time but strauss s statement was interpreted as a promise of very cheap energy from nuclear fission  the u s  aec itself had issued far more realistic testimony regarding nuclear fission to the u s  congress only months before  projecting that  costs can be brought down    to    about the same as the cost of electricity from conventional sources       significant disappointment would develop later on  when the new nuclear plants did not provide energy  too cheap to meter      in      the united nations   first geneva conference   then the world s largest gathering of scientists and engineers  met to explore the technology  in      euratom was launched alongside the european economic community  the latter is now the european union   the same year also saw the launch of the international atomic energy agency  iaea      the world s first commercial nuclear power station  calder hall at windscale  england  was opened in      with an initial capacity of    mw  later     mw       the first commercial nuclear generator to become operational in the united states was the shippingport reactor  pennsylvania  december           one of the first organizations to develop nuclear power was the u s  navy  for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft carriers  the first nuclear powered submarine  ussxa nautilusxa  ssn       was put to sea in december         two u s  nuclear submarines  ussxa scorpion and ussxa thresher  have been lost at sea  eight soviet and russian nuclear submarines have been lost at sea  this includes the soviet submarine k    reactor accident in      which resulted in   deaths and more than    other people were over exposed to radiation    the soviet submarine k    reactor accident in      resulted in   fatalities and    other injuries    moreover  soviet submarine k     sank twice  but was raised after each incident  several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps         the u s  army also had a nuclear power program  beginning in       the sm   nuclear power plant  at fort belvoir  virginia  was the first power reactor in the u s  to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid  vepco   in april       before shippingport  the sl   was a u s  army experimental nuclear power reactor at the national reactor testing station in eastern idaho  it underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in january       which killed its three operators    in soviet union in the mayak production association there were a number of accidents including an explosion that released        tonnes of high level radioactive waste  contaminating a huge territory in the eastern urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries  the soviet regime kept this accident secret for about    years  the event was eventually rated at   on the seven level ines scale  third in severity only to the disasters at chernobyl and fukushima      installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly  rising from less than   gigawatt  gw  in      to     gw in the late     s  and     gw in the late     s  since the late     s worldwide capacity has risen much more slowly  reaching     gw in       between around      and       more than    gw of capacity was under construction  peaking at over     gw in the late     s and early     s    in       around    gw of new capacity was planned  more than two thirds of all nuclear plants ordered after january      were eventually cancelled    a total of    nuclear units were canceled in the usa between      and            during the     s and     s rising economic costs  related to extended construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure group litigation    and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then under construction less attractive  in the     s  u s   and     s  europe   flat load growth and electricity liberalization also made the addition of large new baseload capacity unattractive     the      oil crisis had a significant effect on countries  such as france and japan  which had relied more heavily on oil for electric generation        and     respectively  to invest in nuclear power       some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early     s    and in the late     s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns    these concerns related to nuclear accidents  nuclear proliferation  high cost of nuclear power plants  nuclear terrorism and radioactive waste disposal    in the early     s  there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in wyhl  germany  the project was cancelled in      and anti nuclear success at wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of europe and north america      by the mid     s anti nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence  and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest    although it lacked a single co ordinating organization  and did not have uniform goals  the movement s efforts gained a great deal of attention    in some countries  the nuclear power conflict  reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies        in france  between      and       some         people protested against nuclear power in ten demonstrations    in west germany  between february      and april       some         people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites  several site occupations were also attempted  in the aftermath of the three mile island accident in       some         people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in bonn    in may       an estimated        people  including then governor of california jerry brown  attended a march and rally against nuclear power in washington  d c    anti nuclear power groups emerged in every country that has had a nuclear power programme  some of these anti nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and energy issues       health and safety concerns  the      accident at three mile island  and the      chernobyl disaster played a part in stopping new plant construction in many countries    although the public policy organization  the brookings institution states that new nuclear units  at the time of publishing in       had not been built in the u s  because of soft demand for electricity  and cost overruns on nuclear plants due to regulatory issues and construction delays    by the end of the     s it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly as dramatically as once believed  eventually  more than     reactor orders in the u s  were ultimately cancelled   and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt  a cover story in the february           issue of forbes magazine commented on the overall failure of the u s  nuclear power program  saying it  ranks as the largest managerial disaster in business history        unlike the three mile island accident  the much more serious chernobyl accident did not increase regulations affecting western reactors since the chernobyl reactors were of the problematic rbmk design only used in the soviet union  for example lacking  robust  containment buildings    many of these rbmk reactors are still in use today  however  changes were made in both the reactors themselves  use of a safer enrichment of uranium  and in the control system  prevention of disabling safety systems   amongst other things  to reduce the possibility of a duplicate accident       an international organization to promote safety awareness and professional development on operators in nuclear facilities was created  wano  world association of nuclear operators     opposition in ireland and poland prevented nuclear programs there  while austria         sweden        and italy         influenced by chernobyl  voted in referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power  in july       the italian parliament passed a law that cancelled the results of an earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the italian nuclear program    after the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster a one year moratorium was placed on nuclear power development    followed by a referendum in which over     of voters  turnout      rejected plans for new nuclear power       just as many conventional thermal power stations generate electricity by harnessing the thermal energy released from burning fossil fuels  nuclear power plants convert the energy released from the nucleus of an atom via nuclear fission that takes place in a nuclear reactor  the heat is removed from the reactor core by a cooling system that uses the heat to generate steam  which drives a steam turbine connected to a generator producing electricity     a nuclear reactor is only part of the life cycle for nuclear power  the process starts with mining  see uranium mining   uranium mines are underground  open pit  or in situ leach mines  in any case  the uranium ore is extracted  usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake  and then transported to a processing facility  here  the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride  which is then enriched using various techniques  at this point  the enriched uranium  containing more than the natural      u      is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for  the fuel rods will spend about   operational cycles  typically   years total now  inside the reactor  generally until about    of their uranium has been fissioned  then they will be moved to a spent fuel pool where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away  after about   years in a spent fuel pool the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle  and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed     uranium is a fairly common element in the earth s crust  uranium is approximately as common as tin or germanium in the earth s crust  and is about   xa times more common than silver    uranium is a constituent of most rocks  dirt  and of the oceans  the fact that uranium is so spread out is a problem because mining uranium is only economically feasible where there is a large concentration  still  the world s present measured resources of uranium  economically recoverable at a price of    xa usd kg  are enough to last for between    and     years           according to the oecd in       there is an expected    years worth of uranium in identified resources  when that uranium is used in present reactor technology  with     years of economically recoverable uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ores  while also using present reactor technology  a resource that is recoverable from between        us  kg of uranium     the oecd have noted that     even if the nuclear industry expands significantly  sufficient fuel is available for centuries  if advanced breeder reactors could be designed in the future to efficiently utilize recycled or depleted uranium and all actinides  then the resource utilization efficiency would be further improved by an additional factor of eight     for example  the oecd have determined that with a pure fast reactor fuel cycle with a burn up of  and recycling of  all the uranium and actinides  actinides which presently make up the most hazardous substances in nuclear waste  there is         years worth of uranium in total conventional resources and phosphate ore     according to the oecd s red book in       due to increased exploration  known uranium resources have grown by       since       with this increase translating into greater than a century of uranium available if the metals usage rate were to continue at the      level           current light water reactors make relatively inefficient use of nuclear fuel  fissioning only the very rare uranium     isotope  nuclear reprocessing can make this waste reusable  and more efficient reactor designs  such as the currently under construction generation iii reactors achieve a higher efficiency burn up of the available resources  than the current vintage generation ii reactors  which make up the vast majority of reactors worldwide        as opposed to current light water reactors which use uranium           of all natural uranium   fast breeder reactors use uranium            of all natural uranium   it has been estimated that there is up to five billion years  worth of uranium     for use in these power plants        breeder technology has been used in several reactors  but the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely  at      technological levels  requires uranium prices of more than     usd kg before becoming justified economically     breeder reactors are still however being pursued as they have the potential to burn up all of the actinides in the present inventory of nuclear waste while also producing power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the breeding process        in       there were two breeder reactors producing power  the ph nix in france  which has since powered down in      after    years of operation  and the bn     reactor  a reactor constructed in      beloyarsk  russia which is still operational as of       the electricity output of bn     is     mw   russia plans to expand the nation s use of breeder reactors with the bn     reactor  scheduled to become operational in          and the technical design of a yet larger breeder  the bn      reactor scheduled to be finalized in       with construction slated for          japan s monju breeder reactor restarted  having been shut down in       in      for   months  but shut down again after equipment fell into the reactor during reactor checkups  it is planned to become re operational in late          both china and india are building breeder reactors  with the indian     mwe prototype fast breeder reactor scheduled to become operational in       with plans to build five more by          the china experimental fast reactor began producing power in             another alternative to fast breeders is thermal breeder reactors that use uranium     bred from thorium as fission fuel in the thorium fuel cycle  thorium is about     times more common than uranium in the earth s crust  and has different geographic characteristics  this would extend the total practical fissionable resource base by          india s three stage nuclear power programme features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage  as it has abundant thorium reserves but little uranium     the most important waste stream from nuclear power plants is spent nuclear fuel  it is primarily composed of unconverted uranium as well as significant quantities of transuranic actinides  plutonium and curium  mostly   in addition  about    of it is fission products from nuclear reactions  the actinides  uranium  plutonium  and curium  are responsible for the bulk of the long term radioactivity  whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of the short term radioactivity        high level radioactive waste management concerns management and disposal of highly radioactive materials created during production of nuclear power  the technical issues in accomplishing this are daunting  due to the extremely long periods radioactive wastes remain deadly to living organisms  of particular concern are two long lived fission products  technetium     half life         years  and iodine      half life      million years      which dominate spent nuclear fuel radioactivity after a few thousand years  the most troublesome transuranic elements in spent fuel are neptunium      half life two million years  and plutonium      half life        years      consequently  high level radioactive waste requires sophisticated treatment and management to successfully isolate it from the biosphere  this usually necessitates treatment  followed by a long term management strategy involving permanent storage  disposal or transformation of the waste into a non toxic form        governments around the world are considering a range of waste management and disposal options  usually involving deep geologic placement  although there has been limited progress toward implementing long term waste management solutions     this is partly because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from        to millions of years        according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses        some proposed nuclear reactor designs however such as the american integral fast reactor and the molten salt reactor can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel  transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds  instead of tens of thousands of years  this offers a potentially more attractive alternative to deep geological disposal              another possibility is the use of thorium in a reactor especially designed for thorium  rather than mixing in thorium with uranium and plutonium  i e  in existing reactors   used thorium fuel remains only a few hundreds of years radioactive  instead of tens of thousands of years        since the fraction of a radioisotope s atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half life  the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes  such as the decay chains of     trillion tons of thorium and    trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust s          ton mass            for instance  over a timeframe of thousands of years  after the most active short half life radioisotopes decayed  burying u s  nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top      feet of rock and soil in the united states     million km   by     part in    million over the cumulative amount of natural radioisotopes in such a volume  although the vicinity of the site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average        the nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low level radioactive waste in the form of contaminated items like clothing  hand tools  water purifier resins  and  upon decommissioning  the materials of which the reactor itself is built  in the us  the nuclear regulatory commission has repeatedly attempted to allow low level materials to be handled as normal waste  landfilled  recycled into consumer items  etcetera     in countries with nuclear power  radioactive wastes comprise less than    of total industrial toxic wastes  much of which remains hazardous for long periods     overall  nuclear power produces far less waste material by volume than fossil fuel based power plants     coal burning plants are particularly noted for producing large amounts of toxic and mildly radioactive ash due to concentrating naturally occurring metals and mildly radioactive material from the coal     a      report from oak ridge national laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity being released into the environment than nuclear power operation  and that the population effective dose equivalent  or dose to the public from radiation from coal plants is     times as much as from the ideal operation of nuclear plants     indeed  coal ash is much less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel on a weight per weight basis  but coal ash is produced in much higher quantities per unit of energy generated  and this is released directly into the environment as fly ash  whereas nuclear plants use shielding to protect the environment from radioactive materials  for example  in dry cask storage vessels        disposal of nuclear waste is often said to be the achilles  heel of the industry     presently  waste is mainly stored at individual reactor sites and there are over     locations around the world where radioactive material continues to accumulate  some experts suggest that centralized underground repositories which are well managed  guarded  and monitored  would be a vast improvement     there is an  international consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep geological repositories      with the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the   billion year old natural nuclear fission reactors in oklo  gabon being cited as  a source of essential information today            as of      there were no commercial scale purpose built underground repositories in operation              the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico has been taking nuclear waste since      from production reactors  but as the name suggests is a research and development facility     reprocessing can potentially recover up to     of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel  putting it into new mixed oxide fuel  this produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste  since this is largely short lived fission products  and reduces its volume by over      reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in britain  france and  formerly  russia  soon will be done in china and perhaps india  and is being done on an expanding scale in japan  the full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors  which are not commercially available  france is generally cited as the most successful reprocessor  but it presently only recycles      by mass  of the yearly fuel use     within france and another     in russia        reprocessing is not allowed in the u s     the obama administration has disallowed reprocessing of nuclear waste  citing nuclear proliferation concerns     in the u s   spent nuclear fuel is currently all treated as waste        uranium enrichment produces many tons of depleted uranium  du  which consists of u     with most of the easily fissile u     isotope removed  u     is a tough metal with several commercial uses for example  aircraft production  radiation shielding  and armor as it has a higher density than lead  depleted uranium is also controversially used in munitions  du penetrators  bullets or apfsds tips   self sharpen   due to uranium s tendency to fracture along shear bands           internationally the price of nuclear plants rose     annually in            total costs rose tenfold  the nuclear plant construction time became douple  according to al gore if intended plan does not hold  the delay cost a billion dollars a year        the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject  since there are diverging views on this topic  and multi billion dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant  but low fuel costs  therefore  comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear plants as well as the future costs of fossil fuels and renewables as well as for energy storage solutions for intermittent power sources  cost estimates also need to take into account plant decommissioning and nuclear waste storage costs  on the other hand measures to mitigate global warming  such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading  may favor the economics of nuclear power     in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult  which has an impact on large projects such as nuclear reactors  with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks     in eastern europe  a number of long established projects are struggling to find finance  notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania  and some potential backers have pulled out     where the electricity market is competitive  cheap natural gas is available  and its future supply relatively secure  this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects    and existing plants        analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties  to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state owned or regulated utility monopolies    where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  accident liability and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  in addition  because the potential liability from a nuclear accident is so great  the full cost of liability insurance is generally limited capped by the government  which the u s  nuclear regulatory commission concluded constituted a significant subsidy     many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants        following the      fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  costs are expected to increase for currently operating and new nuclear power plants  due to increased requirements for on site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats        some serious nuclear and radiation accidents have occurred  benjamin k  sovacool has reported that worldwide there have been    accidents at nuclear power plants     fifty seven accidents have occurred since the chernobyl disaster  and         out of     of all nuclear related accidents have occurred in the usa           nuclear power plant accidents include the chernobyl accident        with approximately    deaths so far attributed to the accident and a predicted  eventual total death toll  of from      to        latent cancers deaths  the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster         has not caused any radiation related deaths  with a predicted  eventual total death toll  of from   to       and the three mile island accident         no causal deaths  cancer or otherwise  have been found in follow up studies of this accident    nuclear powered submarine mishaps include the k    reactor accident           the k    reactor accident           and the k     reactor accident           international research is continuing into safety improvements such as passively safe plants    and the possible future use of nuclear fusion     in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated  nuclear power has caused fewer accidental deaths per unit of energy generated than all other major sources of energy generation  energy produced by coal  petroleum  natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths per unit of energy generated  from air pollution and energy accidents  this is found in the following comparisons  when the immediate nuclear related deaths from accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from these other energy sources    when the latent  or predicted  indirect cancer deaths from nuclear energy accidents are compared to the immediate deaths from the above energy sources         and when the combined immediate and indirect fatalities from nuclear power and all fossil fuels are compared  fatalities resulting from the mining of the necessary natural resources to power generation and to air pollution     with these data  the use of nuclear power has been calculated to have prevented a considerable number of fatalities  by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been generated by fossil fuels  and is projected to continue to do so           nuclear power plant accidents  according to benjamin k  sovacool  rank first in terms of their economic cost  accounting for    percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents     however analysis presented in the international journal  human and ecological risk assessment found that coal  oil  liquid petroleum gas and hydro accidents have cost more than nuclear power accidents        following the      japanese fukushima nuclear disaster  authorities shut down the nation s    nuclear power plants  but it has been estimated that if japan had never adopted nuclear power  accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost years of life     as of       the fukushima site remains highly radioactive  with some         evacuees still living in temporary housing  and some land will be unfarmable for centuries  the difficult fukushima disaster cleanup will take    or more years  and cost tens of billions of dollars         in august       edf energy announced it had shut down   of its   reactors for a period of eight weeks due to  cracking   the uk nuclear regulator  onr confirmed there was no release of radioactive material and no persons injured     forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to social isolation  anxiety  depression  psychosomatic medical problems  reckless behavior  even suicide  such was the outcome of the      chernobyl nuclear disaster in the ukraine  a comprehensive      study concluded that  the mental health impact of chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date      frank n  von hippel  a u s  scientist  commented on the      fukushima nuclear disaster  saying that  fear of ionizing radiation could have long term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas         many technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power program have a dual use capability  in that they can be used to make nuclear weapons if a country chooses to do so  when this happens a nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon or a public annex to a  secret  weapons program  the concern over iran s nuclear activities is a case in point        a fundamental goal for american and global security is to minimize the nuclear proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power  if this development is  poorly managed or efforts to contain risks are unsuccessful  the nuclear future will be dangerous      the global nuclear energy partnership is one such international effort to create a distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy  would receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate  in exchange for that nation agreeing to forgo their own indigenous develop of a uranium enrichment program     according to benjamin k  sovacool  a  number of high ranking officials  even within the united nations  have argued that they can do little to stop states using nuclear reactors to produce nuclear weapons      a      united nations report said that     the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technologies  which present obvious risks of proliferation as these technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear weapons        on the other hand  one factor influencing the support of power reactors is due to the appeal that these reactors have at reducing nuclear weapons arsenals through the megatons to megawatts program  a program which has thus far eliminated     metric tons of highly enriched uranium  the equivalent of        nuclear warheads  by converting it into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors  and it is the single most successful non proliferation program to date        the megatons to megawatts program has been hailed as a major success by anti nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear weapons worldwide since the cold war ended     however without an increase in nuclear reactors and greater demand for fissile fuel  the cost of dismantling and down blending has dissuaded russia from continuing their disarmament     currently  according to harvard professor matthew bunn   the russians are not remotely interested in extending the program beyond       we ve managed to set it up in a way that costs them more and profits them less than them just making new low enriched uranium for reactors from scratch  but there are other ways to set it up that would be very profitable for them and would also serve some of their strategic interests in boosting their nuclear exports         in the megatons to megawatts program approximately    billion of weapons grade uranium is being converted to reactor grade uranium in the elimination of        nuclear weapons        in april      there were thirty one countries that have civil nuclear power plants     in       mark diesendorf says that governments of france  india  north korea  pakistan  uk  and south africa have used nuclear power and or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development or to contribute to their supplies of nuclear explosives from military reactors        life cycle analysis  lca  of carbon dioxide emissions show nuclear power as comparable to renewable energy sources  emissions from burning fossil fuels are many times higher              according to the united nations  unscear   regular nuclear power plant operation including the nuclear fuel cycle causes radioisotope releases into the environment amounting to       xa msv  milli sievert  per year of public exposure as a global average      such is small compared to variation in natural background radiation  which averages    xa msv a globally but frequently varies between  xa msv a and   xa msv a depending on a person s location as determined by unscear      as of a      report  the remaining legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident  chernobyl  is      xa msv a in global average exposure  a figure which was     xa msv per person averaged over the entire populace of the northern hemisphere in the year of the accident in       although far higher among the most affected local populations and recovery workers         climate change causing weather extremes such as heat waves  reduced precipitation levels and droughts can have a significant impact on nuclear energy infrastructure     seawater is corrosive and so nuclear energy supply is likely to be negatively affected by the fresh water shortage     this generic problem may become increasingly significant over time     this can force nuclear reactors to be shut down  as happened in france during the      and      heat waves  nuclear power supply was severely diminished by low river  ow rates and droughts  which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling reactors     during the heat waves     reactors had to limit output or shut down      of french electricity is produced by nuclear power and in      a similar situation created a  gw shortage and forced the french government to import electricity     other cases have been reported from germany  where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production   times due to high temperatures between      and          in particular     similar events have happened elsewhere in europe during those same hot summers     if global warming continues  this disruption is likely to increase     the price of energy inputs and the environmental costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity  both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned  returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses  after a cooling off period that may last as long as a century  reactors must be dismantled and cut into small pieces to be packed in containers for final disposal  the process is very expensive  time consuming  dangerous for workers  hazardous to the natural environment  and presents new opportunities for human error  accidents or sabotage        the total energy required for decommissioning can be as much as     more than the energy needed for the original construction  in most cases  the decommissioning process costs between us      million to us     billion  decommissioning at nuclear sites which have experienced a serious accident are the most expensive and time consuming  in the u s  there are    reactors that have permanently shut down and are in some phase of decommissioning  and none of them have completed the process        current uk plants are expected to exceed    bn in decommissioning costs  nuclear decommissioning costs exceed    bn  xa     the nuclear power debate concerns the controversy       which has surrounded the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for civilian purposes  the debate about nuclear power peaked during the     s and     s  when it  reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies   in some countries          proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources    proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution  such as greenhouse gases and smog  in contrast to the chief viable alternative of fossil fuel     nuclear power can produce base load power unlike many renewables which are intermittent energy sources lacking large scale and cheap ways of storing energy     m  king hubbert saw oil as a resource that would run out  and proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source     proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small and can be further reduced by using the latest technology in newer reactors  and the operational safety record in the western world is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants        opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment        these threats include the problems of processing  transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste  the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism  as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining        they also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong  and there have been serious nuclear accidents        critics do not believe that the risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology  they also argue that when all the energy intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered  from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning  nuclear power is neither a low carbon nor an economical electricity source              arguments of economics and safety are used by both sides of the debate     as of       the world nuclear association has said  there is unprecedented interest in renewable energy  particularly solar and wind energy  which provide electricity without giving rise to any carbon dioxide emission  harnessing these for electricity depends on the cost and efficiency of the technology  which is constantly improving  thus reducing costs per peak kilowatt         renewable electricity production  from sources such as wind power and solar power  is sometimes criticized for being intermittent or variable        however  the international energy agency concluded that deployment of renewable technologies  rets   when it increases the diversity of electricity sources  contributes to the flexibility of the system  however  the report also concluded  p xa       at high levels of grid penetration by rets the consequences of unmatched demand and supply can pose challenges for grid management  this characteristic may affect how  and the degree to which  rets can displace fossil fuels and nuclear capacities in power generation         renewable electricity supply in the         range has already been implemented in several european systems  albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system     in       the share of electricity generated by renewable sources in germany was        compared to       for nuclear power after germany shut down     of its    nuclear reactors in          in the united kingdom  the amount of energy produced from renewable energy is expected to exceed that from nuclear power by          and scotland plans to obtain all electricity from renewable energy by          the majority of installed renewable energy across the world is in the form of hydro power     the ipcc has said that if governments were supportive  and the full complement of renewable energy technologies were deployed  renewable energy supply could account for almost     of the world s energy use within forty years     rajendra pachauri  chairman of the ipcc  said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about    of global gdp annually  this approach could contain greenhouse gas levels to less than     parts per million  the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible        the cost of nuclear power has followed an increasing trend whereas the cost of electricity is declining for wind power     in about       wind power became as inexpensive as natural gas citation needed and anti nuclear groups have suggested that in      solar power became cheaper than nuclear power        data from the eia in      estimated that in       solar will have a levelized cost of electricity almost twice that of nuclear      kwh for solar         kwh for nuclear   and wind somewhat less       kwh      however  the us eia has also cautioned that levelized costs of intermittent sources such as wind and solar are not directly comparable to costs of  dispatchable  sources  those that can be adjusted to meet demand         from a safety stand point  nuclear power  in terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered  is comparable to and in some cases  lower than many renewable energy sources         there is however no radioactive spent fuel that needs to be stored or reprocessed with conventional renewable energy sources     a nuclear plant needs to be disassembled and removed  much of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low level nuclear waste        since about      the term nuclear renaissance has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival  driven by rising fossil fuel prices and new concerns about meeting greenhouse gas emission limits     however  the world nuclear association has reported that nuclear electricity generation in      was at its lowest level since             in march      the nuclear emergencies at japan s fukushima i nuclear power plant and shutdowns at other nuclear facilities raised questions among some commentators over the future of the renaissance                 platts has reported that  the crisis at japan s fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world      in      siemens exited the nuclear power sector following the fukushima disaster and subsequent changes to german energy policy  and supported the german government s planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies     china  germany  switzerland  israel  malaysia  thailand  united kingdom  italy    and the philippines have reviewed their nuclear power programs  indonesia and vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants              countries such as australia  austria  denmark  greece  ireland  latvia  liechtenstein  luxembourg  portugal  israel  malaysia  new zealand  and norway remain opposed to nuclear power  following the fukushima i nuclear accidents  the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity built by            the world nuclear association has said that  nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one year fall through      as the bulk of the japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year   data from the international atomic energy agency showed that nuclear power plants globally produced      twh of electricity in        seven per cent less than in       the figures illustrate the effects of a full year of    japanese power reactors producing no power during the year  the permanent closure of eight reactor units in germany was also a factor  problems at crystal river  fort calhoun and the two san onofre units in the usa meant they produced no power for the full year  while in belgium doel   and tihange   were out of action for six months  compared to       the nuclear industry produced     less electricity in             as already noted  the nuclear power industry in western nations has a history of construction delays  cost overruns  plant cancellations  and nuclear safety issues despite significant government subsidies and support             in december       forbes magazine reported that  in developed countries   reactors are not a viable source of new power      even in developed nations where they make economic sense  they are not feasible because nuclear s  enormous costs  political and popular opposition  and regulatory uncertainty      this view echoes the statement of former exelon ceo john rowe  who said in      that new nuclear plants  don t make any sense right now  and won t be economically viable in the foreseeable future     john quiggin  economics professor  also says the main problem with the nuclear option is that it is not economically viable  quiggin says that we need more efficient energy use and more renewable energy commercialization     former nrc member peter bradford and professor ian lowe have recently made similar statements        however  some  nuclear cheerleaders  and lobbyists in the west continue to champion reactors  often with proposed new but largely untested designs  as a source of new power                          much more new build activity is occurring in developing countries like south korea  india and china  china has    reactors under construction  with plans to build more        however  according to a government research unit  china must not build  too many nuclear power reactors too quickly   in order to avoid a shortfall of fuel  equipment and qualified plant workers        in the usa  licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to   xa years        two new generation iii reactors are under construction at vogtle  a dual construction project which marks the end of a    year period of stagnation in the us construction of civil nuclear power reactors  the station operator licenses of almost half the present     power reactors in the us  as of       have been given extensions to   xa years     as of       u s  nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by       all at existing plants    in       four aging  uncompetitive  reactors were permanently closed      relevant state legislatures are trying to close vermont yankee and indian point nuclear power plant       the u s  nrc and the u s  department of energy have initiated research into light water reactor sustainability which is hoped will lead to allowing extensions of reactor licenses beyond    years  provided that safety can be maintained  as the loss in non co  emitting generation capacity by retiring reactors  may serve to challenge u s  energy security  potentially resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions  and contributing to an imbalance between electric supply and demand         there is a possible impediment to production of nuclear power plants as only a few companies worldwide have the capacity to forge single piece reactor pressure vessels     which are necessary in the most common reactor designs  utilities across the world are submitting orders years in advance of any actual need for these vessels  other manufacturers are examining various options  including making the component themselves  or finding ways to make a similar item using alternate methods        according to the world nuclear association  globally during the     s one new nuclear reactor started up every   xa days on average  and by the year      this rate could increase to one every  xa days     as of       watts bar   in tennessee  which came on line on february          was the last u s  commercial nuclear reactor to go on line  this is often quoted as evidence of a successful worldwide campaign for nuclear power phase out     electricity shortages  fossil fuel price increases  global warming  and heavy metal emissions from fossil fuel use  new technology such as passively safe plants  and national energy security may renew the demand for nuclear power plants     following the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by           platts has reported that  the crisis at japan s fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world      in       the economist reported that nuclear power  looks dangerous  unpopular  expensive and risky   and that  it is replaceable with relative ease and could be forgone with no huge structural shifts in the way the world works         in early april       analysts at swiss based investment bank ubs said   at fukushima  four reactors have been out of control for weeks  casting doubt on whether even an advanced economy can master nuclear safety        we believe the fukushima accident was the most serious ever for the credibility of nuclear power         in       deutsche bank analysts concluded that  the global impact of the fukushima accident is a fundamental shift in public perception with regard to how a nation prioritizes and values its populations health  safety  security  and natural environment when determining its current and future energy pathways   as a consequence   renewable energy will be a clear long term winner in most energy systems  a conclusion supported by many voter surveys conducted over the past few weeks  at the same time  we consider natural gas to be  at the very least  an important transition fuel  especially in those regions where it is considered secure         in september       german engineering giant siemens announced it will withdraw entirely from the nuclear industry  as a response to the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan  and said that it would no longer build nuclear power plants anywhere in the world  the company s chairman  peter l scher  said that  siemens was ending plans to cooperate with rosatom  the russian state controlled nuclear power company  in the construction of dozens of nuclear plants throughout russia over the coming two decades         also in september       iaea director general yukiya amano said the japanese nuclear disaster  caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and damaged confidence in nuclear power         in february       the united states nuclear regulatory commission approved the construction of two additional reactors at the vogtle electric generating plant  the first reactors to be approved in over    years since the three mile island accident     but nrc chairman gregory jaczko cast a dissenting vote citing safety concerns stemming from japan s      fukushima nuclear disaster  and saying  i cannot support issuing this license as if fukushima never happened     one week after southern received the license to begin major construction on the two new reactors  a dozen environmental and anti nuclear groups are suing to stop the plant vogtle expansion project  saying  public safety and environmental problems since japan s fukushima daiichi nuclear reactor accident have not been taken into account         countries such as australia  austria  denmark  greece  ireland  italy  latvia  liechtenstein  luxembourg  malta  portugal  israel  malaysia  new zealand  and norway have no nuclear power reactors and remain opposed to nuclear power        however  by contrast  some countries remain in favor  and financially support nuclear fusion research  including eu wide funding of the iter project           worldwide wind power has been increasing at     year  and solar power at     year  from      to       as a replacement for thermal generation of electricity        current fission reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems  with most of the first generation systems having been retired some time ago  research into advanced generation iv reactor types was officially started by the generation iv international forum  gif  based on eight technology goals  including to improve nuclear safety  improve proliferation resistance  minimize waste  improve natural resource utilization  the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity  and decrease the cost to build and run such plants  most of these reactors differ significantly from current operating light water reactors  and are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before             the nuclear reactors to be built at vogtle are new ap     third generation reactors  which are said to have safety improvements over older power reactors     however  john ma  a senior structural engineer at the nrc  is concerned that some parts of the ap     steel skin are so brittle that the  impact energy  from a plane strike or storm driven projectile could shatter the wall     edwin lyman  a senior staff scientist at the union of concerned scientists  is concerned about the strength of the steel containment vessel and the concrete shield building around the ap               the union of concerned scientists has referred to the european pressurized reactor  currently under construction in china  finland and france  as the only new reactor design under consideration in the united states that     appears to have the potential to be significantly safer and more secure against attack than today s reactors         one disadvantage of any new reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design  nuclear engineer david lochbaum has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what was at the time the most recent technology  he argues that  the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold  scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations  and humans make mistakes      as one director of a u s  research laboratory put it   fabrication  construction  operation  and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve  advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes  the technology may be proven  but people are not         hybrid nuclear power is a proposed means of generating power by use of a combination of nuclear fusion and fission processes  the concept dates to the     s  and was briefly advocated by hans bethe during the     s  but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in       due to delays in the realization of pure fusion  when a sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built  it has the potential to be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel  reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude  and more importantly  eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel  substances which cause security concerns        nuclear fusion reactions have the potential to be safer and generate less radioactive waste than fission        these reactions appear potentially viable  though technically quite difficult and have yet to be created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant  fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the     s     construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor facility began in       but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns  the facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year           years after initially anticipated     a follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station  demo  has been proposed       there is also suggestions for a power plant based upon a different fusion approach  that of a inertial fusion power plant     fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable  as fission power had been  however  the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to projections being extended by several decades  in       more than    years after the first attempts  commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before            there are multiple organizations which have taken a position on nuclear power   some are proponents  and some are opponents
