 renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight  wind  rain  tides  waves and geothermal heat   renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas  electricity generation  hot water space heating  motor fuels  and rural  off grid  energy services      based on ren   s      report  renewables contributed    percent to our energy consumption and    percent to our electricity generation in      and       respectively  both  modern renewables  such as hydro  wind  solar and biofuels  as well as traditional biomass  contributed in about equal parts to the global energy supply  worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted to more than us     billion in       with countries like china and the united states heavily investing in wind  hydro  solar and biofuels      renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to other energy sources  which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security  climate change mitigation  and economic benefits   in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power   at the national level  at least    nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than    percent of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond      while many renewable energy projects are large scale  renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries  where energy is often crucial in human development   united nations  secretary general ban ki moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity              renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight  wind  tides  plant growth  and geothermal heat  as the international energy agency explains       renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly  in its various forms  it derives directly from the sun  or from heat generated deep within the earth  included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar  wind  ocean  hydropower  biomass  geothermal resources  and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources     wind power is growing at the rate of     annually  with a worldwide installed capacity of         megawatts  mw  at the end of       and is widely used in europe  asia  and the united states  at the end of      the photovoltaic  pv  capacity worldwide was         mw  and pv power stations are popular in germany and italy  solar thermal power stations operate in the usa and spain  and the largest of these is the     mw segs power plant in the mojave desert  the world s largest geothermal power installation is the geysers in california  with a rated capacity of     mw  brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world  involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane  and ethanol now provides     of the country s automotive fuel  ethanol fuel is also widely available in the usa     renewable energy resources and significant opportunities for energy efficiency exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to other energy sources  which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency  and technological diversification of energy sources  would result in significant energy security and economic benefits      renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas  electricity generation  hot water space heating  motor fuels  and rural  off grid  energy services      as of       small solar pv systems provide electricity to a few million households  and micro hydro configured into mini grids serves many more  over    million households use biogas made in household scale digesters for lighting and or cooking  and more than     million households rely on a new generation of more efficient biomass cookstoves    united nations  secretary general ban ki moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity      at the national level  at least    nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than     of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond  and some     countries have various policy targets for longer term shares of renewable energy  including a     target of all electricity generated for the european union by       some countries have much higher long term policy targets of up to      renewables  outside europe  a diverse group of    or more other countries target renewable energy shares in the           time frame that range from     to          climate change and global warming concerns  coupled with high oil prices  peak oil  and increasing government support  are driving increasing renewable energy legislation  incentives and commercialization   new government spending  regulation and policies helped the industry weather the global financial crisis better than many other sectors    according to a      projection by the international energy agency  solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within    years  reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment       renewable energy sources  that derive their energy from the sun  either directly or indirectly  such as hydro and wind  are expected to be capable of supplying humanity energy for almost another   billion years  at which point the predicted increase in heat from the sun is expected to make the surface of the earth too hot for liquid water to exist         prior to the development of coal in the mid   th century  nearly all energy used was renewable  almost without a doubt the oldest known use of renewable energy  in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires  dates from         years ago  use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later  sometime between         and         years ago       probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water  this practice can be traced back some      years  to ships on the nile       moving into the time of recorded history  the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor  animal power  water power  wind  in grain crushing windmills  and firewood  a traditional biomass  a graph of energy use in the united states up until      shows oil and natural gas with about the same importance in      as wind and solar played in          by       concerns of running out of coal prompted experiments with using solar energy    development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of world war i  the importance of solar energy was recognized in a      scientific american article   in the far distant future  natural fuels having been exhausted solar power will remain as the only means of existence of the human race        the theory of peak oil was published in         in the     s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil  as well as for an escape from dependence on oil  and the first electricity generating wind turbines appeared  solar had long been used for heating and cooling  but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until            the iea      world energy outlook projects a growth of renewable energy supply from      gigawatts in      to      gigawatts in       fossil fuels received about      billion in subsidies in       compared to      billion for all renewable energies       airflows can be used to run wind turbines  modern utility scale wind turbines range from around    xa kw to   mw of rated power  although turbines with rated output of       mw have become the most common for commercial use  the power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed  so as wind speed increases  power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine    areas where winds are stronger and more constant  such as offshore and high altitude sites  are preferred locations for wind farms  typical capacity factors are         with values at the upper end of the range in particularly favourable sites         globally  the long term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production  or    times current electricity demand  assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome  this would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas  particularly in areas of higher wind resources  such as offshore  as offshore wind speeds average      greater than that of land  so offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land stationed turbines       energy in water can be harnessed and used  since water is about     times denser than air  even a slow flowing stream of water  or moderate sea swell  can yield considerable amounts of energy  there are many forms of water energy     hydropower is produced in     countries  with the asia pacific region generating    percent of global hydropower in       china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with     terawatt hours of production in       representing around    percent of domestic electricity use  there are now three hydroelectricity stations larger than    gw  the three gorges dam in china  itaipu dam across the brazil paraguay border  and guri dam in venezuela       wave power  that captures the energy of ocean surface waves  and tidal power  converting the energy of tides  are two forms of hydropower with future potential  however  not yet widely employed commercially  while ocean thermal energy conversion  that uses the temperature difference between cooler deep and warmer surface waters  has currently no economic feasibility     solar energy  radiant light and heat from the sun  is harnessed using a range of ever evolving technologies such as solar heating  photovoltaics  concentrated solar power  solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis         solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture  convert and distribute solar energy  passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun  selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties  and designing spaces that naturally circulate air     active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy  using solar collectors for heating  and solar power  converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics  pv   or indirectly using concentrated solar power  csp      a photovoltaic system converts light into electrical direct current  dc  by taking advantage of the photoelectric effect    solar pv has turned into a multi billion  fast growing industry  continues to improve its cost effectiveness  and has the most potential of any renewable technologies together with csp      concentrated solar power  csp  systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  commercial concentrated solar power plants were first developed in the     s  csp stirling has by far the highest efficiency among all solar energy technologies     in       the international energy agency said that  the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer term benefits  it will increase countries  energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import independent resource  enhance sustainability  reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating climate change  and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared        biomass is biological material derived from living  or recently living organisms  it most often refers to plants or plant derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass    as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel  conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods     wood remains the largest biomass energy source today    examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and tree stumps   yard clippings  wood chips and even municipal solid waste  in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals  including biofuels  industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including miscanthus  switchgrass  hemp  corn  poplar  willow  sorghum  sugarcane  bamboo    and a variety of tree species  ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm  palm oil      plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy  some examples of these plants are wheat  which typically yield       tonnes of grain per hectare  and straw  which typically yield       tonnes per hectare in the uk    the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity  plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments  and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first generation biofuel     biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  rotting garbage  and agricultural and human waste  all release methane gasxa   also called  landfill gas  or  biogas   crops  such as corn and sugar cane  can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel  ethanol  biodiesel  another transportation fuel  can be produced from left over food products like vegetable oils and animal fats    also  biomass to liquids  btls  and cellulosic ethanol are still under research         there is a great deal of research involving algal  or algae derived  biomass due to the fact that it s a non food resource and can be produced at rates   to    times those of other types of land based agriculture  such as corn and soy  once harvested  it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol  butanol  and methane  as well as biodiesel and hydrogen     the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region  forest by products  such as wood residues  are common in the united states  agricultural waste is common in mauritius  sugar cane residue  and southeast asia  rice husks   animal husbandry residues  such as poultry litter  are common in the uk       biofuels include a wide range of fuels which are derived from biomass  the term covers solid biofuels  liquid biofuels  and gaseous biofuels    liquid biofuels include bioalcohols  such as bioethanol  and oils  such as biodiesel  gaseous biofuels include biogas  landfill gas and synthetic gas     bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermenting the sugar components of plant materials and it is made mostly from sugar and starch crops  these include maize  sugar cane and  more recently  sweet sorghum  the latter crop is particularly suitable for growing in dryland conditions  and is being investigated by icrisat for its potential to provide fuel  along with food and animal feed  in arid parts of asia and africa       with advanced technology being developed  cellulosic biomass  such as trees and grasses  are also used as feedstocks for ethanol production  ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions  bioethanol is widely used in the usa and in brazil  the energy costs for producing bio ethanol are almost equal to  the energy yields from bio ethanol  however  according to the european environment agency  biofuels do not address global warming concerns       biodiesel is made from vegetable oils  animal fats or recycled greases  biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates  carbon monoxide  and hydrocarbons from diesel powered vehicles  biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe     biofuels provided      of the world s transport fuel in            geothermal energy is from thermal energy generated and stored in the earth  thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter  earth s geothermal energy originates from the original formation of the planet       and from radioactive decay of minerals          the geothermal gradient  which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface  drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface  the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots geo  meaning earth  and thermos  meaning heat     the heat that is used for geothermal energy can be from deep within the earth  all the way down to earth s corexa         miles       xa km  down  at the core  temperatures may reach over      xa  f       xa  c   heat conducts from the core to surrounding rock  extremely high temperature and pressure cause some rock to melt  which is commonly known as magma  magma convects upward since it is lighter than the solid rock  this magma then heats rock and water in the crust  sometimes up to    xa  f     xa  c        from hot springs  geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times  but it is now better known for electricity generation     burbo  nw england    sunrise at the fenton wind farm in minnesota  united states    the     mw andasol solar power station in andalusia  spain

technologies  with a     annual average growth rate   in       renewable power constituted about a third of the newly built power generation capacities       projections vary  but scientists have advanced a plan to power      of the world s energy with wind  hydroelectric  and solar power by the year              according to a      projection by the international energy agency  solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within    years  reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases that harm the environment  cedric philibert  senior analyst in the renewable energy division at the iea said   photovoltaic and solar thermal plants may meet most of the world s demand for electricity by     xa   and half of all energy needsxa   with wind  hydropower and biomass plants supplying much of the remaining generation    photovoltaic and concentrated solar power together can become the major source of electricity   philibert said       renewable energy technologies are getting cheaper  through technological change and through the benefits of mass production and market competition  a      iea report said   a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances  in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support   and added that  cost reductions in critical technologies  such as wind and solar  are set to continue        hydro electricity and geothermal electricity produced at favourable sites are now the cheapest way to generate electricity  renewable energy costs continue to drop  and the levelised cost of electricity  lcoe  is declining for wind power  solar photovoltaic  pv   concentrated solar power  csp  and some biomass technologies       renewable energy is also the most economic solution for new grid connected capacity in areas with good resources  as the cost of renewable power falls  the scope of economically viable applications increases  renewable technologies are now often the most economic solution for new generating capacity  where  oil fired generation is the predominant power generation source  e g  on islands  off grid and in some countries  a lower cost renewable solution almost always exists today        a series of studies by the us national renewable energy laboratory modeled the  grid in the western us under a number of different scenarios where intermittent renewables accounted for    percent of the total power   in the models  inefficiencies in cycling the fossil fuel plants to compensate for the variation in solar and wind energy resulted in an additional cost of  between       and       to each megawatt hour generated   however  the savings in the cost of the fuels saved  adds up to    billion  meaning the added costs are  at most  two percent of the savings        the three gorges dam in hubei  china  has the world s largest instantaneous generating capacity

years with      breaking a new record in global installations    xa gw     wind power is widely used in europe  asia  and the united states      several countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration  such as     of stationary electricity production in denmark        in portugal        in spain        in ireland   and    in germany in      and have since continued to expand their installed capacity   more than    countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis       the united states conducted much early research in photovoltaics and

constructed in the mojave desert  southwestern united states  the ivanpah solar power facility being the most recent  in developing countries  three world bank projects for integrated solar thermal combined cycle gas turbine power plants in egypt  mexico  and morocco have been approved       photovoltaics  pv  uses solar cells assembled into solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity  it s a fast growing technology doubling its worldwide installed capacity every couple of years  pv systems range from small  residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations  to large utility scale solar plants  the predominant pv technology is crystalline silicon  while thin film solar cell technology accounts for about    percent of global photovoltaic deployment  in recent years  pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency  reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time  epbt   and has reached grid parity in at least    different markets by       financial institutions are predicting a second solar  gold rush  in the near future           at the end of       worldwide pv capacity reached         megawatts

for       global photovoltaic capacity is estimated to increase by another    gigawatts  gw     by       worldwide capacity is projected to reach as much as     gigawatts  this corresponds to a tripling within five years    solar power is expected to become the world s largest source of electricity by       with solar photovoltaics  pv  and solar thermal  csp  contributing     and     respectively  this will require an increase of installed pv capacity from    xa gw to      xa gw  of which more than half will be deployed in china and india       many solar photovoltaic power

antelope valley solar ranch is a first solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the antelope valley area of the western mojave desert  and due to be completed in            many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than fixed mounted systems  there are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations     however  when it comes to renewable energy systems and pv  it is not just large systems that matter  building integrated photovoltaics or  onsite  pv systems use existing land and structures and generate power close to where it is consumed       carbon neutral fuels are synthetic fuels  including methane  gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel or ammonia    produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue gas emissions  recovered from automotive exhaust gas  or derived from carbonic acid in seawater    such fuels are considered carbon neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases    to the extent that synthetic fuels displace fossil fuels  or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid    and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation       such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles    carbon neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage  alleviating the problems of wind and solar intermittency  and they enable distribution of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines    nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative    germany has built a     kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to    megawatts           the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant in grindav k  iceland has been producing   million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since         it has the capacity to produce   million liters per year        biofuels provided    of the world s transport fuel in         mandates for blending biofuels exist in    countries at the national level and in    states provinces    according to the international energy agency  biofuels have the potential to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by             since the     s  brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world s second largest producer of ethanol  after the united states  and the world s largest exporter     brazil s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugarcane as feedstock  and the residual cane waste  bagasse  is used to produce heat and power     there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline  by the end of      there were        filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump        nearly all the gasoline sold in the united states today is mixed with     ethanol  a mix known as e       and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends  ford  daimler ag  and gm are among the automobile companies that sell  flexible fuel  cars  trucks  and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to     ethanol  e     by mid       there were approximately   million e   compatible vehicles on u s  roads     the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date  flex fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability  the energy policy act of       which calls for    xa billion us gallons            xa m   of biofuels to be used annually by       will also help to expand the market        geothermal power is cost effective  reliable  sustainable  and environmentally friendly     but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries  recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources  especially for applications such as home heating  opening a potential for widespread exploitation  geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth  but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels  as a result  geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels     the international geothermal association  iga  has reported that        mw of geothermal power in    countries is online  which is expected to generate        gwh of electricity in          this represents a     increase in geothermal power online capacity since       iga projects this will grow to        mw by       due to the large number of projects presently under consideration  often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource        in       the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with       mw of installed capacity from    power plants     the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers  a geothermal field in california     the philippines follows the us as the second highest producer of geothermal power in the world  with       mw of capacity online  geothermal power makes up approximately     of the country s electricity generation        renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries  in rural and remote areas  transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive  producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative        technology advances are opening up a huge new market for solar power  the approximately     billion people around the world who don t have access to grid electricity  even though they are typically very poor  these people have to pay far more for lighting than people in rich countries because they use inefficient kerosene lamps  solar power costs half as much as lighting with kerosene     an estimated   million households get power from small solar pv systems     kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita  more than        very small solar panels  each producing    to    watts  are sold in kenya annually  some small island developing states  sids  are also turning to solar power to reduce their costs and increase their

million households rely on a new generation of more efficient biomass cookstoves    clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy poor areas of the developing world  alcohol fuels  ethanol and methanol  can be produced sustainably from non food sugary  starchy  and cellulostic feedstocks  project gaia  inc  and cleanstar mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in ethiopia  kenya  nigeria and mozambique        renewable energy projects in many developing countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty reduction by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment  renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking  space heating  and lighting  renewable energy can also contribute to education  by providing electricity to schools        u s  president barack obama s american recovery and reinvestment act of      includes more than     billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs  clean edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help countries around the world pull out of the current economic malaise     leading renewable energy companies include first solar  gamesa  ge energy  q cells  sharp solar  siemens  sunopta  suntech power  and vestas        the military has also focused on the use of renewable fuels for military vehicles  unlike fossil fuels  renewable fuels can be produced in any country  creating a strategic advantage  the us military has already committed itself to have     of its energy consumption come from alternative sources        the international renewable energy agency  irena  is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide  it aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer  irena was formed on    january       by   xa countries signing the charter of irena     as of march       irena has    xa member states who all are considered as founding members  of which    have also ratified the statute        as of           countries have some form of national renewable energy policy target or renewable support policy  national targets now exist in at least    countries  there is also a wide range of policies at state provincial and local levels       united nations  secretary general ban ki moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity   in october       he  announced the creation of a high level group to drum up support for energy access  energy efficiency and greater use of renewable energy  the group is to be co chaired by kandeh yumkella  the chair of un energy and director general of the un industrial development organisation  and charles holliday  chairman of bank of america         the incentive to use      renewable energy  for electricity  transport  or even total primary energy supply globally  has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns  the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand  renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated     at the national level  at least    nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than     of energy supply  also  professors s  pacala and robert h  socolow have developed a series of  stabilization wedges  that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change  and  renewable energy sources   in aggregate  constitute the largest number of their  wedges          mark z  jacobson  professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university and director of its atmosphere and energy program says producing all new energy with wind power  solar power  and hydropower by      is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by       barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   jacobson says that energy costs with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs        similarly  in the united states  the independent national research council has noted that  sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change  energy security  and the escalation of energy costs   renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states  taken collectively  can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand           the most significant barriers to the widespread implementation of large scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological  according to the      post carbon pathways report  which reviewed many international studies  the key roadblocks are  climate change denial  the fossil fuels lobby  political inaction  unsustainable energy consumption  outdated energy infrastructure  and financial constraints        other renewable energy technologies are still under development  and include cellulosic ethanol  hot dry rock geothermal power  and ocean energy     these technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization  many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies  but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research  development and demonstration  rd d  funding        there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields     multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners     sandia has a total budget of      billion    while nrel has a budget of      million        companies such as iogen  poet  and abengoa are building refineries that can process biomass and turn it into ethanol  while companies such as the verenium corporation  novozymes  and dyadic international are producing enzymes which could enable a cellulosic ethanol future  the shift from food crop feedstocks to waste residues and native grasses offers significant opportunities for a range of players  from farmers to biotechnology firms  and from project developers to investors        marine energy  also sometimes referred to as ocean energy  refers to the energy carried by ocean waves  tides  salinity  and ocean temperature differences  the movement of water in the world s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy  or energy in motion  this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes  transport and industries     the term marine energy encompasses both wave powerxa   power from surface waves  and tidal powerxa   obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water  offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy  as wind power is derived from the wind  even if the wind turbines are placed over water     the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations  ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world        enhanced geothermal systems are a new type of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources  the vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non porous rock     egs technologies  enhance  and or create geothermal resources in this  hot dry rock  hdr   through hydraulic stimulation     egs   hdr technologies  like hydrothermal geothermal  are expected to be baseload resources which produce power    hours a day like a fossil plant  distinct from hydrothermal  hdr   egs may be feasible anywhere in the world  depending on the economic limits of drill depth  good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick     xa km  layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss     there are hdr and egs systems currently being developed and tested in france  australia  japan  germany  the u s  and switzerland  the largest egs project in the world is a    megawatt demonstration plant currently being developed in the cooper basin  australia  the cooper basin has the potential to generate             xa mw     concentrated photovoltaics  cpv  systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for the purpose of electricity generation  thermoelectric  or  thermovoltaic  devices convert a temperature difference between dissimilar materials into an electric current     artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol     researchers in this field are striving to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that utilize a wider region of the solar spectrum  employ catalytic systems made from abundant  inexpensive materials that are robust  readily repaired  non toxic  stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds  i e   carbohydrates  rather than building and sustaining living cells      however  prominent research faces hurdles  sun catalytix a mit spin off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel cell in       because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight        renewable electricity production  from sources such as wind power and solar power  is sometimes criticized for being variable or intermittent  however  the international energy agency has stated that deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and  through local generation  contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks        there have been  not in my back yard   nimby  concerns relating to the visual and other impacts of some wind farms  with local residents sometimes fighting or blocking construction     in the usa  the massachusetts cape wind project was delayed for years partly because of aesthetic concerns  however  residents in other areas have been more positive  according to a town councilor  the overwhelming majority of locals believe that the ardrossan wind farm in scotland has enhanced the area        a recent uk government document states that  projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities  this means giving communities both a say and a stake      in countries such as germany and denmark many renewable projects are owned by communities  particularly through cooperative structures  and contribute significantly to overall levels of renewable energy deployment           the market for renewable energy technologies has continued to grow  climate change concerns  coupled with high oil prices  peak oil  and increasing government support  are driving increasing renewable energy legislation  incentives and commercialization   new government spending  regulation and policies helped the industry weather the      economic crisis better than many other sectors
