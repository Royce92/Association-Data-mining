 an electronic calculator is a small  portable electronic device used to perform both basic and complex operations of arithmetic  currently  basic calculators can be very inexpensive  scientific calculators tend to be higher priced     the first solid state electronic calculator was created in the     s  building on the extensive history of tools such as the abacus  developed around      bc  and the mechanical calculator  developed in the   th century  it was developed in parallel with the analog computers of the day     pocket sized devices became available in the     s  especially after the invention of the microprocessor developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom     modern electronic calculators vary from cheap  give away  credit card sized models to sturdy desktop models with built in printers  they became popular in the mid     s as integrated circuits made their size and cost small  by the end of that decade  calculator prices had reduced to a point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools     computer operating systems as far back as early unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc  and calculator functions are included in almost all pda type devices  save a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices      in addition to general purpose calculators  there are those designed for specific markets  for example  there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations  some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra  graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line  or higher dimensional euclidean space     in       calculators still represented an estimated     of the world s general purpose hardware capacity to compute information  this diminished to less than       by                   modern electronic calculators contain a keyboard with buttons for digits and arithmetical operations  some even contain    and     buttons to make large numbers easier to enter  most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button  however  in more specific calculators  a button can perform multi function working with key combination or current reckoning mode     calculators usually have liquid crystal displays as output in place of historical vacuum fluorescent displays  see more details in technical improvements  fractions such as     are displayed as decimal approximations  for example rounded to             also  some fractions such as     which is                   to    significant figures  can be difficult to recognize in decimal form  as a result  many scientific calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or mixed numbers     calculators also have the ability to store numbers into memory  basic types of these store only one number at a time  more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables  the variables can also be used for constructing formulae  some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers  the extended address is referred to as an array index     power sources of calculators are batteries  solar cells or electricity  for old models  turning on with a switch or button  some models even have no turn off button but they provide some way to put off  for example  leaving no operation for a moment  covering solar cell exposure  or closing their lid  crank powered calculators were also common in the early computer era     in most countries  students use calculators for schoolwork  there was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic arithmetic skills would suffer  there remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations  in the head  also known as vedic mathcitation needed   with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained  while others concentrate more on teaching estimation techniques and problem solving  research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in   others have arguedwho  that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy  or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts citation needed in december      the uk s minister of state for schools  nick gibb  voiced concern that children can become  too dependent  on the use of calculators   as a result  the use of calculators is to be included as part of a review of the curriculum      in general  a basic electronic calculator consists of the following components      a basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple   function calculator  to perform the calculation   xa  xa    one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators   xa  xa  xa  xa       all other functions are usually carried out using repeated additions  where calculators have additional functions such as square root  or trigonometric functions  software algorithms are required to produce high precision results  sometimes significant design effort is required to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator chip  with acceptable calculation time      the fundamental difference between a calculator and computer is that a computer can be programmed in a way that allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results  while calculators are pre designed with specific functions such as addition  multiplication  and logarithms built in  the distinction is not clear cut  some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functionality  sometimes with support for programming languages such as rpl or ti basic     typically the user buys the least expensive model having a specific feature set  but does not care much about speed  since speed is constrained by how fast the user can press the buttons   thus designers of calculators strive to minimize the number of logic elements on the chip  not the number of clock cycles needed to do a computation     for instance  instead of a hardware multiplier  a calculator might implement floating point mathematics with code in rom  and compute trigonometric functions with the cordic algorithm because cordic does not require hardware floating point  bit serial logic designs are more common in calculators whereas bit parallel designs dominate general purpose computers  because a bit serial design minimizes chip complexity  but takes many more clock cycles   again  the line blurs with high end calculators  which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design  particularly the z    mc       and arm architectures  as well as some custom designs specifically made for the calculator market      the first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were bones  used to tally items   pebbles and counting boards  and the abacus  known to have been used by sumerians and egyptians before      bc   except for the antikythera mechanism  an  out of the time  astronomical device  development of computing tools arrived near the beginning of the   th century  geometric military compass by galileo  logarithms and napier bones by napier  slide rule by edmund gunter     in       the renaissance saw the invention of the mechanical calculator by wilhelm schickard  and several decades later blaise pascal   a device that was at times somewhat over promoted as being able to perform all four arithmetic operations with minimal human intervention   pascal s calculator could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus  if the tedium could be borne  multiply and divide by repetition  schickard s machine  constructed several decades earlier  used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation   because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether pascal or schickard should be credited as the  inventor  of the adding machine  or calculating machine  is probably pointless     schickard and pascal were followed by gottfried leibniz who spent forty years designing a four operation mechanical calculator  inventing in the process his leibniz wheel  but who couldn t design a fully operational machine    there were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the   th century       the   th century saw the arrival of some interesting improvements  first by poleni with the first fully functional calculating clock and four operation machine  but these machines were almost always one of the kind  it was not until the   th century and the industrial revolution that real developments began to occur  although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the   th century  the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible  the arithmometer  invented in      as a four operation mechanical calculator  was released to production in      as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit  forty years later  by       about       arithmometers had been sold   plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers  burkhardt  germany       and layton  uk        and felt and tarrant  the only other competitor in true commercial production  had sold     comptometers       it wasn t until      that the familiar push button user interface was developed  with the introduction of the dalton adding machine  developed by james l  dalton in the united states     the curta calculator was developed in      and  although costly  became popular for its portability  this purely mechanical hand held device could do addition  subtraction  multiplication and division  by the early     s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators  although the curta remains a popular collectable item     the first mainframe computers  using firstly vacuum tubes and later transistors in the logic circuits  appeared in the     s and     s  this technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators     the casio computer company  in japan  released the model    a calculator in       which was the world s first all electric  relatively   compact  calculator  it did not use electronic logic but was based on relay technology  and was built into a desk     in october       the world s first all electronic desktop calculator  the british bell punch sumlock comptometer anita  a new inspiration to arithmetic accounting  was announced      this machine used vacuum tubes  cold cathode tubes and dekatrons in its circuits  with    cold cathode  nixie  tubes for its display  two models were displayed  the mk vii for continental europe and the mk viii for britain and the rest of the world  both for delivery from early       the mk vii was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication  and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler mark viii  the anita had a full keyboard  similar to mechanical comptometers of the time  a feature that was unique to it and the later sharp cs   a among electronic calculators  the anita weighed roughly    pounds due to its large tube system    bell punch had been producing key driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names  plus  and  sumlock   and had realised in the mid     s that the future of calculators lay in electronics  they employed the young graduate norbert kitz  who had worked on the early british pilot ace computer project  to lead the development  the anita sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available  and was silent and quick     the tube technology of the anita was superseded in june      by the u s  manufactured friden ec      which had an all transistor design  a stack of four    digit numbers displayed on a   inch    xa cm  crt  and introduced reverse polish notation  rpn  to the calculator market for a price of        which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time  like bell punch  friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics  in      more all transistor electronic calculators were introduced  sharp introduced the cs   a  which weighed   xa kg    xa lb  and cost         yen   us        and industria macchine elettroniche of italy introduced the ime     to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it  but apparently not at the same time      there followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers  including canon  mathatronics  olivetti  scm  smith corona marchant   sony  toshiba  and wang  the early calculators used hundreds of germanium transistors  which were cheaper than silicon transistors  on multiple circuit boards  display types used were crt  cold cathode nixie tubes  and filament lamps  memory technology was usually based on the delay line memory or the magnetic core memory  though the toshiba  toscal  bc      appears to have used an early form of dynamic ram built from discrete components  already there was a desire for smaller and less power hungry machines     the olivetti programma     was introduced in late       it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built in printer  memory  implemented by an acoustic delay line  could be partitioned between program steps  constants  and data registers  programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards  it is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company  that is  a desktop electronic calculating machine programmable by non specialists for personal use   the olivetti programma     won many industrial design awards     another calculator introduced in      was bulgaria s elka           developed by the central institute for calculation technologies and built at the elektronika factory in sofia  the name derives from elektronen kalkulator  and it weighed around   kg  it is the first calculator in the world which includes the square root function  later that same year were released the elka     with a luminescent display        and the elka     with an in built printer  several other models were developed until the first pocket model  the elka      was released in       the writing on it was in roman script  and it was exported to western countries           the monroe epic programmable calculator came on the market in       a large  printing  desk top unit  with an attached floor standing logic tower  it could be programmed to perform many computer like functions  however  the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch  goto  at the end of the operation stack  returning the program to its starting instruction  thus  it was not possible to include any conditional branch  if then else  logic  during this era  the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer     the first handheld calculator  a prototype called  cal tech   was developed by texas instruments in       it could add  multiply  subtract  and divide  and its output device was a paper tape         the electronic calculators of the mid     s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of transistors on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an ac power supply  there were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer integrated circuits  chips  and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of semiconductor development  u s  semiconductor manufacturers led the world in large scale integration  lsi  semiconductor development  squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits  this led to alliances between japanese calculator manufacturers and u s  semiconductor companies  canon inc  with texas instruments  hayakawa electric  later known as sharp corporation  with north american rockwell microelectronics  busicom with mostek and intel  and general instrument with sanyo     by       a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption  allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries  the first portable calculators appeared in japan in       and were soon marketed around the world  these included the sanyo icc       mini calculator   the canon pocketronic  and the sharp qt  b  micro compet   the canon pocketronic was a development of the  cal tech  project which had been started at texas instruments in      as a research project to produce a portable calculator  the pocketronic has no traditional display  numerical output is on thermal paper tape  as a result of the  cal tech  project  texas instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators     sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in january      the sharp el    also marketed as the facit       which was close to being a pocket calculator  it weighed about     grams or        pound  had a vacuum fluorescent display  rechargeable nicad batteries  and initially sold for          however  the efforts in integrated circuit development culminated in the introduction in early      of the first  calculator on a chip   the mk     by mostek    followed by texas instruments later in the year  although these early hand held calculators were very expensive  these advances in electronics  together with developments in display technology  such as the vacuum fluorescent display  led  and lcd   led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all     in      pico electronics    and general instrument also introduced their first collaboration in ics  a complete single chip calculator ic for the monroe royal digital iii calculator  pico was a spinout by five gi design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ics  pico and gi went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market     the first truly pocket sized electronic calculator was the busicom le    a  handy   which was marketed early in         made in japan  this was also the first calculator to use an led display  the first hand held calculator to use a single integrated circuit  then proclaimed as a  calculator on a chip    the mostek mk      and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries  using four aa size cells the le    a measures    x   x    in     x  x   mm      the first american made pocket sized calculator  the bowmar    b  popularly referred to as the bowmar brain   measuring                 in               xa mm   came out in the autumn of       with four functions and an eight digit red led display  for       while in august      the four function sinclair executive became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring                  in              xa mm  and weighing    xa oz    g   it retailed for around      by the end of the decade  similar calculators were priced less than        the first soviet made pocket sized calculator  the  elektronika b      was developed by the end of      and sold at the beginning of          one of the first low cost calculators was the sinclair cambridge  launched in august       it retailed for         or    less in kit form  the sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition  however  their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of transcendental functions       meanwhile hewlett packard  hp  had been developing a pocket calculator  launched in early      it was unlike the other basic four function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with scientific functions that could replace a slide rule  the      hp     along with nearly all later hp engineering calculators  used reverse polish notation  rpn   also called postfix notation  a calculation like    plus    is  using rpn  performed by pressing       enter         and      instead of the algebraic infix notation                         the first soviet scientific pocket sized calculator the  b      was completed by the end of          in       texas instruments  ti  introduced the sr      sr signifying slide rule  an algebraic entry pocket calculator using scientific notation for       shortly after the sr    featured an additional key for entering      it was followed the next year by the sr    which added log and trig functions to compete with the hp     and in      the mass marketed ti    line which is still produced     in      a new company  calculated industries  came onto the scene  focusing on specific markets  their first calculator  the loan arranger          was a pocket calculator marketed to the real estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values  in       ci launched a calculator for the construction industry called the construction master   which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations  such as angles  stairs  roofing math  pitch  rise  run  and feet inch fraction conversions   this would be the first in a line of construction related calculators     adler   s pocket calculator with vacuum fluorescent display  vfd  from the mid     s    the casio cm     mini electronic calculator provided basic functions in the     s    the      sinclair executive pocket

and casio  al        these machines were  however  very heavy and expensive  the first programmable pocket calculator was the hp     in       it had a capacity of     instructions  and could store and retrieve programs with a built in magnetic card reader  two years later the hp   c introduced continuous memory  i e  programs and data were retained in cmos memory during power off  in       hp released the first alphanumeric  programmable  expandable calculator  the hp   c  it could be expanded with ram  memory  and rom  software  modules  as well as peripherals like bar code readers  microcassette and floppy disk drives  paper roll thermal printers  and miscellaneous communication interfaces  rs      hp il  hp ib      the first soviet programmable desktop calculator iskra      powered by the power grid  was released at the beginning of the     s  the first soviet pocket battery powered programmable calculator  elektronika  b       was developed by the end of      and released at the beginning of       the successor of b      the elektronika b     wasn t backward compatible with b      even if it kept the reverse polish notation  rpn   thus b     defined a new command set  which later was used in a series of later programmable soviet calculators  despite very limited capabilities     bytes of instruction memory and about    stack and addressable registers   people managed to write all kinds of programs for them  including adventure games and libraries of calculus related functions for engineers  hundreds  perhaps thousands  of programs were written for these machines  from practical scientific and business software  which were used in real life offices and labs  to fun games for children  the elektronika mk    calculator  using the extended b     command set  and featuring internal eeprom memory for storing programs and external interface for eeprom cards and other periphery  was used in soviet spacecraft program  for soyuz tm   flight  as a backup of the board computer     this series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter intuitive mysterious undocumented features  somewhat similar to  synthetic programming  of the american hp     which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages  jumping to non existent addresses and other techniques  a number of respected monthly publications  including the popular science magazine                   science and life    featured special columns  dedicated to optimization techniques for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers  which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches  known as  yeggogology                   the error messages on those calculators appear as a russian word  yeggog            which  unsurprisingly  is translated to  error      a similar hacker culture in the usa revolved around the hp     which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than b         through the     s the hand held electronic calculator underwent rapid development  the red led and blue green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life  often measured in hours  so rechargeable nickel cadmium batteries were common  or were large so that they could take larger  higher capacity batteries  in the early     s liquid crystal displays  lcds  were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime  busicom introduced the busicom le    a  handy  calculator  the first pocket sized calculator and the first with an led display  and announced the busicom lc with lcd display  however  there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale  the first successful calculators with lcds were manufactured by rockwell international and sold from      by other companies under such names as  dataking lc      harden dt     ibico      lloyds     lloyds      prismatic      a k a  p      rapid data rapidman     lc  the lcds were an early form using the dynamic scattering mode dsm with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background  to present a high contrast display these models illuminated the lcd using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide  which negated the low power consumption of the display  these models appear to have been sold only for a year or two     a more successful series of calculators using a reflective dsm lcd was launched in      by sharp inc with the sharp el      which was a slim pocket calculator  this  and another few similar models  used sharp s  cos   calculator on substrate  technology  an extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the required chips based on a new hybrid technology  the  cos  technology may have been too expensive since it was only used in a few models before sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards     in the mid     s the first calculators appeared with field effect  twisted nematic tn lcds with dark numerals against a grey background  though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging ultraviolet rays  the advantage of lcds is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light  which require much less power than light emitting displays such as leds or vfds  this led the way to the first credit card sized calculators  such as the casio mini card lc    of       which could run for months of normal use on button cells     there were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators  all of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first  calculator on a chip  integrated circuits in       but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high  many calculators continued to use two or more integrated circuits  ics   especially the scientific and the programmable ones  into the late     s     the power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced  especially with the introduction of cmos technology  appearing in the sharp  el      in       the transistors in the logic cells of cmos ics only used any appreciable power when they changed state  the led and vfd displays often required additional driver transistors or ics  whereas the lcd displays were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator ic itself     with this low power consumption came the possibility of using solar cells as the power source  realised around      by such calculators as the royal solar    sharp el       and teal photon     at the beginning of the     s hand held electronic calculators were very expensive  costing two or three weeks  wages  and so were a luxury item  the high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were expensive to produce  and production runs were not very large  many companies saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on these high prices  however  the cost of calculators fell as components and their production techniques improved  and the effect of economies of scale was felt     by      the cost of the cheapest four function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars  about one   th of the cost five years earlier  the consequences of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable  and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit out of calculators  leading to many companies dropping out of the business or closing down altogether  the companies that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators  or producing high specification scientific and programmable calculators     the first calculator capable of symbolic computation was the hp   c  released in       it was able to  for example  solve quadratic equations symbolically  the first graphing calculator was the casio fx     g released in          the two leading manufacturers  hp and ti  released increasingly feature laden calculators during the     s and     s  at the turn of the millennium  the line between a graphing calculator and a handheld computer was not always clear  as some very advanced calculators such as the ti     the voyage     and hp   g could differentiate and integrate functions  solve differential equations  run word processing and pim software  and connect by wire or ir to other calculators computers     the hp   c financial calculator is still produced  it was introduced in      and is still being made with few changes  the hp   c featured the reverse polish notation mode of data entry  in      several new models were released  including an improved version of the hp   c  the  hp   c platinum edition  which added more memory  more built in functions  and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry     calculated industries competed with the hp   c in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling  changing the  i    pv    fv  to easier labeling terms such as  int    term    pmt   and not using the reverse polish notation  however  ci s more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators  which evolved and expanded in the     s to present  according to mark bollman    a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at albion college  the  construction master is the first in a long and profitable line of ci construction calculators  which carried them through the     s      s  and to the present     personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functionality of a calculator  using the graphical user interface to portray a calculator  one such example is windows calculator  most personal data assistants  pda  and smartphones also have such a feature     these are some of the manufacturers which made a notable contribution to calculator development
