 a server is a running instance of an application  software  capable of accepting requests from the client and giving responses accordingly  servers can run on any computer including dedicated computers  which individually are also often referred to as  the server      servers operate within a client server architecture  servers are computer programs running to serve the requests of other programs  the clients  thus  the server performs some tasks on behalf of clients  it facilitates the clients to share data  information or any hardware and software resources  the clients typically connect to the server through the network but may run on the same computer  in the context of internet protocol  ip  networking  a server is a program that operates as a socket listener      servers often provide essential services across a network  either to private users inside a large organization or to public users via the internet  typical computing servers are database server  file server  mail server  print server  web server  gaming server  and application server      numerous systems use this client server networking model including web sites and email services  an alternative model  peer to peer networking enables all computers to act as either a server or client as needed             the term server is used quite broadly in information technology  despite the many server branded products available  such as server versions of hardware  software or operating systems   in theory  any computerised process that shares a resource to one or more client processes is a server  to illustrate this  take the common example of file sharing  while the existence of files on a machine does not classify it as a server  the mechanism that shares these files to clients by the operating system is the server     similarly  consider a web server application  such as the multiplatform  apache http server    this web server software can be run on any capable computer  for example  while a laptop or personal computer is not typically known as a server  they can in these situations fulfill the role of one  and hence be labelled as one  it is  in this case  the machine s role that places it in the category of server     in the hardware sense  the word server typically designates computer models intended for hosting software applications under the heavy demand of a network environment  in this client server configuration  one or more machines  either a computer or a computer appliance  share information with each other with one acting as a host for the others     while nearly any personal computer is capable of acting as a network server  a dedicated server will contain features making it more suitable for production environments  these features may include a faster cpu  increased high performance ram  and increased storage capacity in the form of a larger or multiple hard drives  servers also typically have reliability  availability and serviceability  ras  and fault tolerance features  such as redundancy in power supplies  storage  as in raid   and network connections     servers became common in the early     s as businesses increasingly began using personal computers to provide services formerly hosted on larger mainframes or minicomputers  early file servers housed multiple cd rom drives  which were used to host large database applications citation needed    between the     s and     s an increase in the use of dedicated hardware saw the advent of self contained server appliances  one well known product is the google search appliance  a unit that combines hardware and software in an out of the box packaging  also produced were the cobalt qube and the raq  simpler examples of such appliances include switches  routers  gateways  and print servers  all of which are available in a near plug and play configuration     modern operating systems such as microsoft windows or linux distributions seem to be designed with a client server architecture in mind  these operating systems attempt to abstract hardware  allowing a wide variety of software to work with components of the computer  in a sense  the operating system can be seen as serving hardware to the software  which in all but low level programming languages must interact using an api     these operating systems may be able to run programs in the background called either services or daemons  such programs  such as the above mentioned apache http server software  may wait in a sleep state for their necessity to become apparent  since any software that provides services can be called a server  modern personal computers can be seen as a forest of servers and clients operating in parallel     the internet itself is also a forest of servers and clients  merely requesting a web page from a few kilometers away involves satisfying a stack of protocols that involve many examples of hardware and software servers  the least of these are the routers  modems  domain name servers  and various other servers necessary to provide us the world wide web     the introduction of cloud computing allows server storage and other resources to be shared in a pool and provides servers with a higher degree of fault tolerance     hardware requirement for servers vary  depending on the server application  absolute cpu speed is not quite as critical to a server as it is to a desktop machinecitation needed  servers  duties to provide service to many users over a network lead to different requirements such as fast network connections and high i o throughout  since servers are usually accessed over a network  they may run in headless mode without a monitor or input device  processes that are not needed for the server s function are not used  many servers do not have a graphical user interface  gui  as it is unnecessary and consumes resources that could be allocated elsewhere  similarly  audio and usb interfaces may be omitted     servers often run for long periods without interruption and availability must often be very high  making hardware reliability and durability extremely important  although servers can be built from commodity computer parts  mission critical enterprise servers are ideally very fault tolerant and use specialized hardware with low failure rates in order to maximize uptime  for even a short term failure can cost more than purchasing and installing the system  for example  it may take only a few minutes of down time at a national stock exchange to justify the expense of entirely replacing the system with something more reliable  servers may incorporate faster  higher capacity hard drives  larger computer fans or water cooling to help remove heat  and uninterruptible power supplies that ensure the servers continue to function in the event of a power failure  these components offer higher performance and reliability at a correspondingly higher price  hardware redundancy installing more than one instance of modules such as power supplies and hard disks arranged so that if one fails another is automatically available is widely used  ecc memory devices that detect and correct errors are used  non ecc memory is more likely to cause data corruption      to increase reliability  most servers use memory with error detection and correction  redundant disks  redundant power supplies and so on  such components are also frequently hot swappable  allowing technicians to replace them on the running server without shutting it down  to prevent overheating  servers often have more powerful fans  as servers are usually administered by qualified system administrators  their operating systems are also more tuned for stability and performance than for user friendliness and ease of use  linux taking a noticeably larger percentage than for desktop computers      as servers are often noisy and they need a stable power supply  good internet access  and increased security  it is usual to store them in dedicated server centers  this requires reducing the power consumption  as the extra energy used generates more heat thus causing the temperature in the room to exceed acceptable limits  hence normally  server rooms are equipped with air conditioning devices  server casings are usually flat and wide  typically measured in  rack units    adapted to store many devices next to each other in a server rack  unlike ordinary computers  servers usually can be configured  powered up and down or rebooted remotely  using out of band management  typically based on ipmi     many servers take quite a long time for the hardware to start up and load the operating system  servers often do extensive pre boot memory testing and verification and startup of remote management services  the hard drive controllers then start up banks of drives sequentially  rather than all at once  so as not to overload the power supply with startup surges  and afterwards they initiate raid system pre checks for correct operation of redundancy  it is common for a machine to take several minutes to start up  but it may not need restarting for months or years     the rise of the microprocessor based server was facilitated by the development of unix to run on the x   microprocessor architecture  the dominant operating systems among servers are unix like open source distributions  such as those based on linux and freebsd      windows and mac os x server operating systems are deployed on a minority of servers  as are other proprietary mainframe operating systems  such as z os  the microsoft windows family of operating systems also runs on x   hardware and  since windows nt  have been available in versions suitable for server use      server oriented operating systems have certain features  such as     server oriented operating systems can  in many cases  interact with hardware sensors to detect conditions such as overheating  processor and disk failure  and consequently alert an operator or take remedial measures themselves      because servers must supply a restricted range of services to perhaps many users while a desktop computer must carry out a wide range of functions required by its user  the requirements of an operating system for a server are different from those of a desktop machine  while it is possible for an operating system to make a machine both provide services and respond quickly to the requirements of a user  it is common to use different operating systems on servers and desktop machines  some operating systems are supplied in both server and desktop versions with similar user interface      while the role of server and desktop operating systems remains distinct  improvements in the reliability of both hardware and operating systems have blurred the distinction between the two classes  today  many desktop and server operating systems share similar code bases  differing mostly in configuration  the shift towards web applications and middleware platforms has also lessened the demand for specialist application servers citation needed    in a general network environment the following types of servers may be found     almost the entire structure of the internet is based upon a client server model  high level root nameservers  dns  and routers direct the traffic on the internet  there are millions of servers connected to the internet  running continuously throughout the world      virtually every action taken by an ordinary internet user requires one or more interactions with one or more servers that operate on an inter server
