 information technology  it  is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store  retrieve  transmit and manipulate data   often in the context of a business or other enterprise      the term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks  but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones  several industries are associated with information technology  including computer hardware  software  electronics  semiconductors  internet  telecom equipment  e commerce and computer services  a    humans have been storing  retrieving  manipulating and communicating information since the sumerians in mesopotamia developed writing in about     xa bc   but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a      article published in the harvard business review  authors harold j  leavitt and thomas l  whisler commented that  the new technology does not yet have a single established name  we shall call it information technology  it    their definition consists of three categories  techniques for processing  the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision making  and the simulation of higher order thinking through computer programs      based on the storage and processing technologies employed  it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of it development  pre mechanical      xa bcxa       xa ad   mechanical              electromechanical             and electronic       present    this article focuses on the most recent period  electronic   which began in about                  devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years  probably initially in the form of a tally stick   the antikythera mechanism  dating from about the beginning of the first century bc  is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer  and the earliest known geared mechanism   comparable geared devices did not emerge in europe until the   th century   and it was not until      that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed       electronic computers  using either relays or valves  began to appear in the early     s  the electromechanical zuse z   completed in       was the world s first programmable computer  and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine  colossus  developed during the second world war to decrypt german messages was the first electronic digital computer  although it was programmable  it was not general purpose  being designed to perform only a single task  it also lacked the ability to store its program in memory  programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring    the first recognisably modern electronic digital stored program computer was the manchester small scale experimental machine  ssem   which ran its first program on    june            the development of transistors in the late     s at bell laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption  the first commercially available stored program computer  the ferranti mark i  contained      valves and had a power consumption of    kilowatts  by comparison the first transistorised computer  developed at the university of manchester and operational by november       consumed only     watts in its final version       early electronic computers such as colossus made use of punched tape  a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes  a technology now obsolete    electronic data storage  which is used in modern computers  dates from world war ii  when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals  the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line    the first random access digital storage device was the williams tube  based on a standard cathode ray tube    but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed  and thus was lost once power was removed  the earliest form of non volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum  invented in        and used in the ferranti mark    the world s first commercially available general purpose electronic computer       ibm introduced the first hard disk drive in       as a component of their     ramac computer system    most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks  or optically on media such as cd roms    until      most information was stored on analog devices  but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time  as of      almost     of the data stored worldwide was held digitally        on hard disks      on optical devices and     on digital magnetic tape  it has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than   exabytes in      to     exabytes in         doubling roughly every   years       database management systems emerged in the     s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly  one of the earliest such systems was ibm s information management system  ims     which is still widely deployed more than    years later    ims stores data hierarchically    but in the     s ted codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables  rows and columns  the first commercially available relational database management system  rdbms  was available from oracle in            all database management systems consist of a number of components that together allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity  a characteristic of all databases is that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself  in a database schema       the extensible markup language  xml  has become a popular format for data representation in recent years  although xml data can be stored in normal file systems  it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their  robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort     as an evolution of the standard generalized markup language  sgml   xml s text based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human readable       the relational database model introduced a programming language independent structured query language  sql   based on relational algebra       the terms  data  and  information  are not synonymous  anything stored is data  but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully    most of the world s digital data is unstructured  and stored in a variety of different physical formats  b even within a single organization  data warehouses began to be developed in the     s to integrate these disparate stores  they typically contain data extracted from various sources  including external sources such as the internet  organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems  dss        data transmission has three aspects  transmission  propagation  and reception    it can be broadly categorized as broadcasting  in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream  or telecommunications  with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels       xml has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early     s    particularly for machine oriented interactions such as those involved in web oriented protocols such as soap    describing  data in transit rather thanxa     data at rest     one of the challenges of such usage is converting data from relational databases into xml document object model  dom  structures       hilbert and lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change  a kind of moore s law   machines  application specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every    months between      and       the per capita capacity of the world s general purpose computers doubled every    months during the same two decades  the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every    months  the world s storage capacity per capita required roughly    months to double  every   years   and per capita broadcast information has doubled every      years       massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day  but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs   data archives that are seldom visited     to address that issue  the field of data miningxa    the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data   xa   emerged in the late     s       in an academic context  the association for computing machinery defines it as  undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business  government  healthcare  schools  and other kinds of organizationsxa      it specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization  integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure  and installing  customizing  and maintaining those applications for the organization s computer users        in a business context  the information technology association of america has defined information technology as  the study  design  development  application  implementation  support or management of computer based information systems     the responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration  software development and installation  and the planning and management of an organization s technology life cycle  by which hardware and software are maintained  upgraded and replaced     the business value of information technology lies in the automation of business processes  provision of information for decision making  connecting businesses with their customers  and the provision of productivity tools to increase efficiency     employment distribution of computer systems design and related services            employment in the
