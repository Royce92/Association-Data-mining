diagonally  about      to     xa cm    to   inch screen   are operated like tablet pcs using a touchscreen or a stylus  and can also have a physical keyboard  there is no clear boundary between subnotebooks and ultra mobile pcs     the first generation umpcs were simple pcs running linux or an adapted version of microsoft s tablet pc operating system  with the announcement of the umpc  microsoft dropped the licensing requirement that tablet pcs must support proximity sensing of the stylus  which microsoft termed  hovering      second generation umpcs use less electricity and can therefore be used longer  up to five hours  and also support windows vista     originally code named project origami  the project was launched in      as a collaboration between microsoft  intel

quietly launched for the umpc  then still referred to by its codename   project origami    speculation over  what is origami   and pictures of the rumored prototypes were passed around and covered extensively on engadget  scobleizer   thatedeguy  and other technology sites  finalization of the origami project was announced in time to keep the excitement level high for cebit     much speculation positioned origami as a portable gaming device that would directly compete with nintendo s ds and sony s psp  this rumor gained credibility after videos were leaked showing halo  combat evolved being played on a umpc  while the movie was quickly taken down from its original source  mirrors exist on many other sites    later in the week  the associated press confirmed that  origami  was actually to be a regular pc with  limited gaming capabilities       the first umpcs on the market were amtek s t    and samsung s q      the amtek t    is sold in the usa as the tabletkiosk eo v      agopc ago

 oqo is also selling umpcs  the oqo model    was actually launched well before the ultra mobile pc craze began  but its specifications were very similar to the umpc specifications     in september       raon digital launched the vega running an amd geode lx        xa mb of ram  and a   xa gb hard drive  it has a      screen  a    xa mhz processor  and a battery life of     hours  it runs microsoft

specification for computers with a   xa cm    inch  or smaller touch sensitive screen at a minimum resolution of            to make it more suited for the small form factor  windows xp tablet pc edition was originally used with slight tweaks to the interface and a software add on known as the touch pack interface to make the interface more suitable for use of a stylus as well as hands  when the umpc was disclosed at cebit       samsung  asus  and founder had near complete devices on display  recently  the umpc initiative has included later windows versions     umpcs with windows xp installed are able to run any software that has been written for the windows xp platform  though the small form factor often mandates some changes to the interface  the standard windows xp interface is the default  though a choice of having an interface more suited for the small form factor is available with the touch pack interface  as the units are so small  many umpcs do not feature a physical keyboard  but an on screen virtual keyboard provided in the touch pack interface  such as the dialkeys  below   also  since the device has standard usb     connectivity  external keyboards and mice can be attached     umpc devices include either intel or via processors      mb to   gb of ram  and a    to     gb hard disk  depending on the manufacturer    other ultra mobile devices feature amd or transmeta crusoe cpus  ultra mobile pcs can also feature global positioning system  gps  devices  webcams  fingerprint readers  stereo speakers  tv tuners  and memory card readers  bluetooth  wi fi  ethernet and wwan connections are sometimes included as well     umpcs have enough processing power to support audio  video  and gaming  in addition to having rich support for browsing the internet as well as for other communication and networking applications  windows media player is included  with a special skin designed to provide a better experience on the small screen  the devices also feature directx   class graphics  and all applications available for standard tablet pcs are expected to be compatible     in       prices of umpcs were approximately       in the united states  and although microsoft made efforts to push down prices for the      holiday season  they were not expected to reach the us     range market analysts felt was necessary to achieve mainstream success    most umpcs are now available with windows    although many new umpcs come with the option to have xp or linux installed  as some devices are too sluggish to run the vista kernel on which   is based  one example of this is the samsung q  ultra which originally launched with only vista versions  but subsequently launched windows xp versions    this is largely because umpc hardware at the time was too close to the minimum vista requirements to be comfortably used     a new text input method was implemented for ultra mobile pcs  consisting of two rings of keys around the lower corners of the screen  dialkeys is intended for use with the thumbs     there are currently several companies developing accessories exclusively for the    umpc platform  these include carry cases  screen protectors  styli  protective bump cases and docking stations  in addition  several prototypes of  mounting solutions  have been previewed which permit the umpc device to be mounted in the car  on the wall or attached to an adjustable arm  user interface software that enables umpc s to become portable  infotainment  devices is evolving  there are touch friendly  voice controlled  user interface software platforms designed to run on windows xp and vista based umpcs that allows users to control windows without the need of a mouse and keyboard
