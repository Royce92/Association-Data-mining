 in neoclassical microeconomic theory  profit is either of two related but distinct concepts  economic profit is similar to accounting profit but smaller because it subtracts off the total opportunity costs  not just the explicit costs  but also the implicit costs  of a venture to an investor   normal profit refers to zero economic profit   a concept related to economic profit  and sometimes considered synonymous  is that of economic rent     in classical economics and marxian economics  profit is the return to an owner of capital goods or natural resources in any productive pursuit involving labor  or a return on bonds and money invested in capital markets   by extension  in marxian economic theory  the maximization of profit corresponds to the accumulation of capital  which is the driving force behind economic activity within the capitalist mode of production     other types of profit have been referenced  including social profit  related to externalities   it is not to be confused with profit in finance and accounting  which is equal to revenue minus only explicit costs   and superprofit  a concept in marxian economic theory     related concepts include profitability and the profit motive             normal profit is a component of  implicit  costs and not a component of business profit at all  it represents the opportunity cost  as the time that the owner spends running the firm could be spent on running another firm  the enterprise component of normal profit is thus the profit that a business owner considers necessary to make running the business worth her or his while i e  it is comparable to the next best amount the entrepreneur could earn doing another job   particularly if enterprise is not included as a factor of production  it can also be viewed a return to capital for investors including the entrepreneur  equivalent to the return the capital owner could have expected  in a safe investment   plus compensation for risk   in other words  the cost of normal profit varies both within and across industries  it is commensurate with the riskiness associated with each type of investment  as per the risk return spectrum     only normal profits arise in circumstances of perfect competition when long run economic equilibrium is reached  there is no incentive for firms to either enter or leave the industry      economic profit does not occur in perfect competition in long run equilibrium  if it did  there would be an incentive for new firms to enter the industry  aided by a lack of barriers to entry until there was no longer any economic profit   as new firms enter the industry  they increase the supply of the product available in the market  and these new firms are forced to charge a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply these new firms are supplying as the firms all compete for customers  see  persistence  in the monopoly profit discussion       incumbent firms within the industry face losing their existing customers to the new firms entering the industry  and are therefore forced to lower their prices to match the lower prices set by the new firms  new firms will continue to enter the industry until the price of the product is lowered to the point that it is the same as the average cost of producing the product  and all of the economic profit disappears    when this happens  economic agents outside of the industry find no advantage to forming new firms that enter into the industry  the supply of the product stops increasing  and the price charged for the product stabilizes  settling into an equilibrium        the same is likewise true of the long run equilibria of monopolistically competitive industries and  more generally  any market which is held to be contestable  normally  a firm that introduces a differentiated product can initially secure a temporary market power for a short while  see  persistence  in monopoly profit   at this stage  the initial price the consumer must pay for the product is high  and the demand for  as well as the availability of the product in the market  will be limited  in the long run  however  when the profitability of the product is well established  and because there are few barriers to entry     the number of firms that produce this product will increase until the available supply of the product eventually becomes relatively large  the price of the product shrinks down to the level of the average cost of producing the product  when this finally occurs  all monopoly profit associated with producing and selling the product disappears  and the initial monopoly turns into a competitive industry     in the case of contestable markets  the cycle is often ended with the departure of the former  hit and run  entrants to the market  returning the industry to its previous state  just with a lower price and no economic profit for the incumbent firms     profit can  however  occur in competitive and contestable markets in the short run  as firms jostle for market position  once risk is accounted for  long lasting economic profit in a competitive market is thus viewed as the result of constant cost cutting and performance improvement ahead of industry competitors  allowing costs to be below the market set price     economic profit is  however  much more prevalent in uncompetitive markets such as in a perfect monopoly or oligopoly situation  in these scenarios  individual firms have some element of market power  though monopolists are constrained by consumer demand  they are not price takers  but instead either price setters or quantity setters  this allows the firm to set a price which is higher than that which would be found in a similar but more competitive industry  allowing them economic profit in both the long and short run       the existence of economic profits depends on the prevalence of barriers to entry  these stop other firms from entering into the industry and sapping away profits   like they would in a more competitive market  in cases where barriers are present  but more than one firm  firms can collude to limit production  thereby restricting supply in order to ensure the price of the product remains high enough to ensure all of the firms in the industry achieve an economic profit         however  some economists  for instance steve keen  a professor at the university of western sydney  argue that even an infinitesimal amount of market power can allow a firm to produce a profit and that the absence of economic profit in an industry  or even merely that some production occurs at a loss  in and of itself constitutes a barrier to entry     in a single goods case  a positive economic profit happens when the firm s average cost is less than the price of the product or service at the profit maximizing output  the economic profit is equal to the quantity of output multiplied by the difference between the average cost and the price     often  governments will try to intervene in uncompetitive markets to make them more competitive  antitrust  us  or competition  elsewhere  laws were created to prevent powerful firms from using their economic power to artificially create the barriers to entry they need to protect their economic profits     this includes the use of predatory pricing toward smaller competitors      for example  in the united states  microsoft corporation was initially convicted of breaking anti trust law and engaging in anti competitive behavior in order to form one such barrier in united states v  microsoft  after a successful appeal on technical grounds  microsoft agreed to a settlement with the department of justice in which they were faced with stringent oversight procedures and explicit requirements   designed to prevent this predatory behaviour  with lower barriers  new firms can enter the market again  making the long run equilibrium much more like that of a competitive industry  with no economic profit for firms     if a government feels it is impractical to have a competitive marketxa   such as in the case of a natural monopolyxa   it will sometimes try to regulate the existing uncompetitive market by controlling the price firms charge for their product    for example  the old at t  regulated  monopoly  which existed before the courts ordered its breakup  had to get government approval to raise its prices  the government examined the monopoly s costs  and determined whether or not the monopoly should be able raise its price and if the government felt that the cost did not justify a higher price  it rejected the monopoly s application for a higher price  though a regulated firm will not have an economic profit as large as it would in an unregulated situation  it can still make profits well above a competitive firm in a truly competitive market      the social profit from a firm s activities is the normal profit plus or minus any externalities or consumer surpluses that occur in its activity  a firm may report relatively large monetary profits  but by creating negative externalities their social profit could be relatively small     profitability is a term of economic efficiency  mathematically it is a relative indexxa   a fraction with profit as numerator and generating profit flows or assets as denominator     it is a standard economic assumption  though not necessarily a perfect one in the real world  that  other things being equal  a firm will attempt to maximize its profits    given that profit is defined as the difference in total revenue and total cost  a firm achieves a maximum by operating at the point where the difference between the two is at its greatest  in markets which do not show interdependence  this point can either be found by looking at these two curves directly  or by finding and selecting the best of the points where the gradients of the two curves  marginal revenue and marginal cost respectively  are equal  in interdependent markets  game theory must be used to derive a profit maximising solution
