 in economics and business  a network effect  also called network externality or demand side economies of scale  is the effect that one user of a good or service has on the value of that product to other people  when a network effect is present  the value of a product or service is dependent on the number of others using it      the classic example is the telephone  the more people who own telephones  the more valuable the telephone is to each owner  this creates a positive externality because a user may purchase a telephone without intending to create value for other users  but does so in any case  online social networks work in the same way  with sites like twitter and facebook becoming more attractive as more users join     the expression  network effect  is applied most commonly to positive network externalities as in the case of the telephone  negative network externalities can also occur  where more users make a product less valuable  but are more commonly referred to as  congestion   as in traffic congestion or network congestion      over time  positive network effects can create a bandwagon effect as the network becomes more valuable and more people join  in a positive feedback loop             network effects were a central theme in the arguments of theodore vail  the first post patent president of bell telephone  in gaining a monopoly on us telephone services  in       when he presented the concept in bell s annual report  there were over      local and regional telephone exchanges  most of which were eventually merged into the bell system     the economic theory of the network effect was advanced significantly between      and      by researchers michael l  katz  carl shapiro  joseph farrell and garth saloner      network effects were popularized by robert metcalfe  stated as metcalfe s law  metcalfe was one of the co inventors of ethernet and a co founder of the company  com  in selling the product  metcalfe argued that customers needed ethernet cards to grow above a certain critical mass if they were to reap the benefits of their network      according to metcalfe  the rationale behind the sale of networking cards was that     the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of cards installed  but     the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users  this was expressed algebraically as having a cost of n  and a value of n   while the actual numbers behind this definition were never firm  the concept allowed customers to share access to expensive resources like disk drives and printers  send e mail  and access the internet     rod beckstrom presented a mathematical model for describing networks that are in a state of positive network effect at blackhat and defcon in      and also presented the  inverse network effect  with an economic model for defining it as well      network effects become significant after a certain subscription percentage has been achieved  called critical mass  at the critical mass point  the value obtained from the good or service is greater than or equal to the price paid for the good or service  as the value of the good is determined by the user base  this implies that after a certain number of people have subscribed to the service or purchased the good  additional people will subscribe to the service or purchase the good due to the value exceeding the price     a key business concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass  one way is to rely on extrinsic motivation  such as a payment  a fee waiver  or a request for friends to sign up  a more natural strategy is to build a system that has enough value without network effects  at least to early adopters  then  as the number of users increases  the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base     beyond critical mass  the increasing number of subscribers generally cannot continue indefinitely  after a certain point  most networks become either congested or saturated  stopping future uptake  congestion occurs due to overuse  the applicable analogy is that of a telephone network  while the number of users is below the congestion point  each additional user adds additional value to every other customer  however  at some point the addition of an extra user exceeds the capacity of the existing system  after this point  each additional user decreases the value obtained by every other user  in practical terms  each additional user increases the total system load  leading to busy signals  the inability to get a dial tone  and poor customer support  the next critical point is where the value obtained again equals the price paid  the network will cease to grow at this point  and the system must be enlarged  the congestion point may be larger than the market size  new peer to peer technological models may always defy congestion  peer to peer systems  or  p p   are networks designed to distribute load among their user pool  this theoretically allows true p p networks to scale indefinitely  the p p based telephony service skype benefits greatly from this effect  though market saturation will still occur      network effects are commonly mistaken for economies of scale  which result from business size rather than interoperability  to help clarify the distinction  people speak of demand side vs  supply side economies of scale  classical economies of scale are on the production side  while network effects arise on the demand side  network effects are also mistaken for economies of scope     the network effect has a lot of similarities with the description of phenomenon in reinforcing positive feedback loops described in system dynamics  system dynamics could be used as a modelling method to describe phenomena such as word of mouth and bass model of marketing     network effect is a benefit to society as a whole because it positively relates to and affects the intellectual commons  property rights  and cultural commons of the world  one form of network externality is social media  which is a peer to peer network ran by a privately held for profit business  although the creation of a large network creates a barrier to entry according to porters five forces and may prevent a few from creating a new form of p p networking  it largely benefits society as whole and provides a new form of a common pool resource solargely scalable that the entire world has the ability to use it  although the barrier to entry may be high  there is no true form of monopoly in the p p social sharing market  for example  facebook holds a large stake in the p p social sharing market  but it is not mutually exclusive  meaning users can have an account on facebook and also have an account on twitter  furthermore  there becomes no true critical mass in this space due to the ability for technology and innovation to constantly adapt to different environments  market for underdeveloped countries to integrate with social sharing is unlimited     network effect relates to the intellectual commons in a positive way  through p p networks users are able to share their intellectual property in a way that can benefit society as a whole the sharing of intellectual property ultimately relates to  economic growth due to the ability for creators to share information and still possibly benefit financially from it  through p p networks people are able to share types of education like scholarly articles  becoming a new form of public commons  network externality like ted com is an example of how intellectual commons with the use of network externality benefits society as a whole  those who present intellectual property at ted conferences are sharing their education on a public forum that benefits whoever will listen  therefore  the larger ted com network becomes positively correlates to those who benefit from its common pool resources     p p networks positively affect property rights  in reference to property rights  it enables those who create the intellectual property  the right to use the good  the right to earn income from the good  the right to transfer the good to others  the right to enforcement of property rights  through p p networks those who provide intellectual property not only have these rights  but they also possess the right to claim their information on a public forum  due to these rights sharing benefits the intellectual property holders and promotes p p sharing in a positive way  those who consume the intellectual property also benefit positively from the sharing of it because they are able to use the information freely with respect to the person who created it  an example of this system in effect is a company called music vault  music vault operates on the p p network facebook  enabling users who create music to openly and freely collaborate with other artists content  this is a form of remixing that benefits both parties  this is an example of how a p p network positively affects the sharing of property rights  in joseph e  stiglitz essay prizes  not patents  he suggests that the creation of intellectual property should be rewarded with by social gratification and rewards instead of patents preventing others from duplicating the creation and sharing it as a common pool resource  this can be related to p p networking because it creates a greater incentive for those who create intellectual property to share it is a common pool resource  as a p p sharing network becomes larger the gratification of being rewarded on a global public forum would compete with a patent  it is through large p p networks and network externality that humans can create a reward system large enough to deter seekers of patents to be rewarded in different ways     network externality positively affects the cultural commons in many ways  the reward for being part of a group  society  and even the world through a p p network is one of the greatest benefits that a modern common pool resource can provide the ability to connect and create with people from different cultures  ethnicities  and beliefs is something thought to be impossible     years ago  without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible  through p p sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums  in sugata mitra s ted talk   the child driven education  he placed a computer in the a third world town and left it there to see what would happen  to his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings   this example is a benefit to society for several reasons  the first is the relationship between sugata mitra and the p p network which led him to place the computer in a third world town  along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum  secondly  it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it  this experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the p p network and network externality that led individuals to the ted talk     if some existing technology or company whose benefits are largely based on network effects starts to lose market share against a challenger such as a disruptive technology or open standards based competition  the benefits of network effects will reduce for the incumbent  and increase for the challenger  in this model  a tipping point is eventually reached at which the network effects of the challenger dominate those of the former incumbent  and the incumbent is forced into an accelerating decline  whilst the challenger takes over the incumbent s former position citation needed    not surprisingly network economics became a hot topic after the diffusion of the internet across academia  most people know only of metcalfe s law as part of network effects  network effects are notorious for causing lock in with the most cited examples being microsoft products and the qwerty keyboard      vendor lock in can be mitigated by opening the standards upon which users depend  allowing competition between implementations  this does not  however  mitigate industry wide lock in to the standard itself  indeed  as there are now multiple vendors driving down the price and increasing the quality  more users are likely to adopt the standard thereby creating greater industry wide lock in to the standard     there are many ways to classify networks effects  one popular segmentation views network effects as being of four kinds      additionally  there are two sources of economic value that are relevant when analyzing products that display network effects     negative network effects  in the mathematical sense  are those that have the opposite effect on stability compared to normal  positive  network effects  just like positive network effects cause positive feedback loops and exponential growth  negative network effects create negative feedback and exponential decay  in nature  negative network effects are the forces that pull towards equilibrium  are responsible for stability  and are the physical limitations preventing states from reaching infinity     in communication and information technologies  open standards and interfaces are often developed through the participation of multiple companies and are usually perceived to provide mutual benefit  but  in cases in which the relevant communication protocols or interfaces are closed standards the network effect can give the company controlling those standards monopoly power  the microsoft corporation is widely seen by computer professionals as maintaining its monopoly through these means  one observed method microsoft uses to put the network effect to its advantage is called embrace  extend and extinguish     mirabilis is an israeli start up which pioneered instant messaging  im  and was bought by america online  by giving away their icq product for free and preventing interoperability between their client software and other products  they were able to temporarily dominate the market for instant messaging  because of the network effect  new im users gained much more value by choosing to use the mirabilis system  and join its large network of users  than they would using a competing system  as was typical for that era  the company never made any attempt to generate profits from their dominant position before selling the company     stock exchanges and derivatives exchanges feature a network effect  market liquidity is a major determinant of transaction cost in the sale or purchase of a security  as a bid ask spread exists between the price at which a purchase can be done versus the price at which the sale of the same security can be done  as the number of buyers and sellers on an exchange increases  liquidity increases  and transaction costs decrease  this then attracts a larger number of buyers and sellers to the exchange  see  for example  the work of steve wunsch              the network advantage of financial exchanges is apparent in the difficulty that startup exchanges have in dislodging a dominant exchange  for example  the chicago board of trade has retained overwhelming dominance of trading in us treasury bond futures despite the startup of eurex us trading of identical futures contracts  similarly  the chicago mercantile exchange has maintained a dominance in trading of eurobond interest rate futures despite a challenge from euronext liffe     there are very strong network effects operating in the market for widely used computer software     take  for example  microsoft office  for many people choosing an office suite  prime considerations include how valuable having learned that office suite will prove to potential employers  and how well the software interoperates with other users  that is  since learning to use an office suite takes many hours  they want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers and clients  and they also want to be able to share documents   additionally  an example of an indirect network effect in this case is the notable similarity in user interfaces and operability menus of most new softwarexa   since that similarity directly translates into less time spent learning new environments  therefore potentially greater acceptance and adoption of those products      similarly  finding already trained employees is a big concern for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on  the lack of cross platform user interface standards results in a situation in which one firm is in control of almost      of the market     microsoft windows is a further example of network effect  the most vaunted advantage of windows  and that most publicised by microsoft  is that windows is compatible with the widest range of computer hardware and software  although this claim is justified  it is in reality the result of network effect  hardware and software manufacturers ensure that their products are compatible with windows in order to have access to the large market of windows users  thus  windows is popular because it is well supported  but is well supported because it is popular     however  network effects need not lead to market dominance by one firm  when there are standards which allow multiple firms to interoperate  thus allowing the network externalities to benefit the entire market  this is true for the case of x   based personal computer hardware  in which there are extremely strong market pressures to interoperate with pre existing standards  but in which no one firm dominates in the market  also  it is true for the development of enterprise software applications where the internet  http   databases  sql   and to a moderate degree  service oriented message buses  soa  have become common interfaces  further up the development chain there are network effects as well in language back end base platforms  jvm  clr  llvm   programming models  fp  oop  and languages themselves       in      apple released the iphone followed by the app store  most iphone apps rely heavily on the existence of strong network effects  this enables the software to grow in popularity very quickly and spread to a large userbase with very limited marketing needed  the free mium business model has evolved to take advantage of these network effects by releasing a free version that will not limit the adoption or any users and then charge for  premium  features as the primary source of revenue     the same holds true for the market for long distance telephone service within the united states  in fact  the existence of these types of networks discourages dominance of the market by one company  as it creates pressures which work against one company attempting to establish a proprietary protocol or to even distinguish itself by means of product differentiation     many web sites also feature a network effect  one example is web marketplaces and exchanges  in that the value of the marketplace to a new user is proportional to the number of other users in the market  for example  ebay would not be a particularly useful site if auctions were not competitive  however  as the number of users grows on ebay  auctions grow more competitive  pushing up the prices of bids on items  this makes it more worthwhile to sell on ebay and brings more sellers onto ebay  which drives prices down again as this increases supply  while bringing more people onto ebay because there are more things being sold that people want  essentially  as the number of users of ebay grows  prices fall and supply increases  and more and more people find the site to be useful     social networking websites are also good examples  the more people register onto a social networking website  the more useful the website is to its registrants       by contrast  the value of a news site is primarily proportional to the quality of the articles  not to the number of other people using the site  similarly  the first generation of search sites experienced little network effect  as the value of the site was based on the value of the search results  this allowed google to win users away from yahoo  without much trouble  once users believed that google s search results were superior  some commentators mistook the value of the yahoo  brand  which does increase as more people know of it  for a network effect protecting its advertising business     alexa internet uses a technology that tracks users  surfing patterns  thus alexa s related sites results improve as more users use the technology  alexa s network relies heavily on a small number of browser software relationships  which makes the network more vulnerable to competition     google has also attempted to create a network effect in its advertising business with its google adsense service  google adsense places ads on many small sites  such as blogs  using google technology to determine which ads are relevant to which blogs  thus  the service appears to aim to serve as an exchange  or ad network  for matching many advertisers with many small sites  such as blogs   in general  the more blogs google adsense can reach  the more advertisers it will attract  making it the most attractive option for more blogs  and so on  making the network more valuable for all participants     network effects were used as justification for some of the dot com business models in the late     s  these firms operated under the belief that when a new market comes into being which contains strong network effects  firms should care more about growing their market share than about becoming profitable  this was believed because market share will determine which firm can set technical and marketing standards and thus determine the basis of future competition     there are strong network effects in the initial choice of rail gauge  and in gauge conversion decisions  even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines  track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off the shelf rolling stock  although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges  most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works with one of the standard rail gauges
