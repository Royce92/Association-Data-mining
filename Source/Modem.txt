 a modem  modulator demodulator  is a device that modulates signals to encode digital information and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information  the goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data  modems can be used with any means of transmitting analog signals  from light emitting diodes to radio  a common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data     modems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time  usually expressed in bits per second  symbol bit s  sometimes abbreviated  bps    or bytes per second  symbol b s   modems can also be classified by their symbol rate  measured in baud  the baud unit denotes symbols per second  or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signal  for example  the itu v    standard used audio frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies  corresponding to two distinct symbols  or one bit per symbol   to carry     bits per second using     baud  by contrast  the original itu v    standard  which could transmit and receive four distinct symbols  two bits per symbol   transmitted       bits by sending     symbols per second      baud  using phase shift keying             news wire services in the     s used multiplex devices that satisfied the definition of a modem  however the modem function was incidental to the multiplexing function  so they are not commonly included in the history of modems  modems grew out of the need to connect teleprinters over ordinary phone lines instead of the more expensive leased lines which had previously been used for current loop based teleprinters and automated telegraphs  in       ibm adapted this technology to their unit record equipment and were able to transmit punched cards at    bits second citation needed    mass produced modems in the united states began as part of the sage air defense system in       the year the word modem was first used    connecting terminals at various airbases  radar sites  and command and control centers to the sage director centers scattered around the u s  and canada  sage modems were described by at t s bell labs as conforming to their newly published bell     dataset standard  while they ran on dedicated telephone lines  the devices at each end were no different from commercial acoustically coupled bell          baud modems     in summer     citation needed  the name data phone was introduced to replace the earlier term digital subset  the     data phone was a half duplex asynchronous service that was marketed extensively in late     citation needed  in     citation needed  the    a and    b data phones were introduced  they were synchronous modems using two bit per baud phase shift keying  psk   the    a operated half duplex at      xa bit s over normal phone lines  while the    b provided full duplex      xa bit s service on four wire leased lines  the send and receive channels each running on their own set of two wires     the famous bell    a dataset standard was also introduced by at t in       it provided full duplex service at     bit s over normal phone lines  frequency shift keying was used  with the call originator transmitting at       or      xa hz and the answering modem transmitting at       or      xa hz  the readily available    a  gave an important boost to the use of remote low speed terminals such as the teletype model    asr and ksr  and the ibm       at t reduced modem costs by introducing the originate only    d and the answer only    b c modems     for many years  the bell system  at t  maintained a monopoly on the use of its phone lines  and what devices could be connected to its lines  however  the seminal hush a phone v  fcc case of      concluded that it was within the fcc s jurisdiction to regulate the operation of the system  subsequently  the fcc examiner found that as long as the device was not electrically attached it would not threaten to degenerate the system  this led to a number of devices that mechanically connected to the phone  through a standard handset  since most handsets were supplied from western electric  it was relatively easy to build such an acoustic coupler  and this style of connection was used for many devices like answering machines     acoustically coupled bell    a compatible     bit s modems became common during the     s  with well known models including the novation cat and the anderson jacobson  the latter spun off from an in house project at stanford research institute  now sri international   an even lower cost option was the pennywhistle modem  designed to be built using parts found at electronics scrap and surplus stores     in december       vadic introduced the va      which was notable because it provided full duplex operation at      xa bit s over the phone network  like the    a  it used different frequency bands for transmit and receive  in november       at t introduced the    a modem to compete with vadic  it was similar in design to vadic s model  but used the lower frequency set for transmission  one could also use the    a with a    a modem at     bit s  according to vadic  the change in frequency assignments made the     intentionally incompatible with acoustic coupling  thereby locking out many potential modem manufacturers  in       vadic responded with the va     triple modem  an answer only modem sold to computer center operators that supported vadic s       bit s mode  at t s    a mode  and    a operation     the hush a phone decision applied only to mechanical collections  but the carterfone decision of      led to the fcc introducing a rule setting stringent at t designed tests for electronically coupling a device to the phone lines  at t s tests were complex  making electronically coupled modems expensive citation needed so acoustically coupled modems remained common into the early     s     however  the rapidly falling prices of electronics in the late     s led to an increasing number of direct connect models around       in spite of being directly connected  these modems were generally operated like their earlier acoustic versions dialling and other phone control operations were completed by hand  using an attached handset  a small number of modems added the ability to automatically answer incoming calls  or automatically place an outgoing call to a single number  but even these limited features were relatively rare or limited to special models in a lineup  when more flexible solutions were needed   rd party  diallers  were used to automate calling  normally using a separate serial port     the introduction of microcomputer systems with internal expansion slots made the first software controllable modems common  slot connections gave the computer complete access to the modem s memory or i o channels  which allowed software to send commands to the modem  not just data  this led to a series of popular modems for the s     bus and apple ii computers that could directly dial the phone  answer incoming calls  and hang up the phone  the basic requirements of a bulletin board system  bbs   the seminal cbbs was created on an s     machine with a hayes internal modem  and a number of similar systems followed     the next major advance in modems was the hayes smartmodem  introduced in       the smartmodem was an otherwise standard    a     bit s direct connect modem  but it was attached to a small microcontroller that watched the data stream for certain character strings representing commands  the now standard hayes command set included instructions for picking up and hanging up the phone  dialing numbers  and answering calls  among others  this was similar to the commands offered by the internal modems  but unlike them  the smartmodem could be connected to any computer with an rs     port  which was practically every microcomputer built     the introduction of the smartmodem made communications much simpler and more easily accessed  this provided a growing market for other vendors  who licensed the hayes patents and competed on price or by adding features  through the     s  a number of new higher speed modems  first       and then      xa bit s  greatly improved the responsiveness of the online systems  and made file transfer practical  this led to rapid growth of online services with their large file libraries  which in turn gave more reason to own a modem  the rapid update of modems led to a similar rapid increase in bbs use  which was helped by the fact that bbss could control the modem simply by sending strings  rather than talking to a device driver that was different for every direct connect modem     the     bit s modems used audio frequency shift keying to send data  in this system the stream of  s and  s in computer data is translated into sounds which can be easily sent on the phone lines  in the bell     system  the originating modem sends  s by playing a      xa hz tone  and  s at      xa hz  with the answering modem transmitting its  s on      xa hz and  s on      xa hz  these frequencies were chosen carefully  they are in the range that suffers minimum distortion on the phone system and are not harmonics of each other     in the      xa bit s and faster systems  phase shift keying was used  in this system the two tones for any one side of the connection are sent at similar frequencies as in the    xa bit s systems  but slightly out of phase  voiceband modems generally remained at     and      xa bit s  v    and v     into the mid     s  a v   bis       bit s system similar in concept to the       bit s bell     signaling was introduced in the u s   and a slightly different one in europe  the limited available frequency range meant the symbol rate of       bit s modems was still only     baud  symbols per second   the bit rate increases were achieved by defining   or   distinct symbols  which allowed the encoding of   or   bits per symbol instead of only    the use of smaller shifts had the drawback of making each symbol more vulnerable to interference  but improvements in phone line quality at the same time helped compensate for this  by the late     s  most modems could support all of these standards and       bit s operation was becoming common     many other standards were also introduced for special purposes  commonly using a high speed channel for receiving  and a lower speed channel for sending  one typical example was used in the french minitel system  in which the user s terminals spent the majority of their time receiving information  the modem in the minitel terminal thus operated at      xa bit s for reception  and   xa bit s for sending commands back to the servers     three u s  companies became famous for high speed versions of the same concept  telebit introduced its trailblazer modem in       which used a large number of   xa bit s channels to send data one way at rates up to       xa bit s  a single additional channel in the reverse direction allowed the two modems to communicate how much data was waiting at either end of the link  and the modems could change direction on the fly  the trailblazer modems also supported a feature that allowed them to spoof the uucp g protocol  commonly used on unix systems to send e mail  and thereby speed uucp up by a tremendous amount  trailblazers thus became extremely common on unix systems  and maintained their dominance in this market well into the     s     usrobotics  usr  introduced a similar system  known as hst  although this supplied only      xa bit s  in early versions at least  and provided for a larger backchannel  rather than offer spoofing  usr instead created a large market among fidonet users by offering its modems to bbs sysops at a much lower price  resulting in sales to end users who wanted faster file transfers  hayes was forced to compete  and introduced its own       bit s standard  express     also known as ping pong   which was generally similar to telebit s pep  hayes  however  offered neither protocol spoofing nor sysop discounts  and its high speed modems remained rare     echo cancellation was the next major advance in modem design     local telephone lines use the same wires to send and receive  which results in a small amount of the outgoing signal being reflected back  this is useful for people talking on the phone  as it provides a signal to the speaker that their voice is making it through the system  however  this reflected signal causes problems for the modem  which is unable to distinguish between a signal from the remote modem and the echo of its own signal  this was why earlier modems split the signal frequencies into  answer  and  originate   the modem could then ignore any signals in the frequency range it was using for transmission  even with improvements to the phone system allowing higher speeds  this splitting of available phone signal bandwidth still imposed a half speed limit on modems     echo cancellation eliminated this problem  during the call setup and negotiation period  both modems send a series of unique tones and then listen for them to return through the phone system  they measure the total delay time and then set up a local delay loop to the same time  once the connection is completed  they send their signals into the phone lines as normal  but also into the delay  which is inverted  the signal returning through the echo meets the inverted version coming from the delay line  and cancels out the echo  this allowed both modems to use the full spectrum available  doubling the speed     additional improvements were introduced via the quadrature amplitude modulation  qam  encoding system  previous systems using phase shift keying  psk  encoded two bits  or sometimes three  per symbol by slightly delaying or advancing the signal s phase relative to a set carrier tone  qam used a combination of phase shift and amplitude to encode four bits per symbol  transmitting at       baud produced the      xa bit s v   ter standard  the same working at a base rate of       baud produced the      xa bit s v     the carrier frequency was      xa hz in both systems  for many years  most engineers considered this rate to be the limit of data communications over telephone networks     the introduction of these higher speed systems also led to the digital fax machine during the     s  digital faxes are simply an image format sent over a high speed  commonly     xa kbit s  modem  software running on the host computer can convert any image into fax format  which can then be sent using the modem  such software was at one time an add on  but has since become largely universal     operations at these speeds pushed the limits of the phone lines  resulting in high error rates  this led to the introduction of error correction systems built into the modems  made most famous with microcom s mnp systems  a string of mnp standards came out in the     s  each increasing the effective data rate by minimizing overhead  from about     theoretical maximum in mnp    to     in mnp    the new method called mnp   added data compression to the system  thereby increasing overall throughput above the modem s rating  generally the user could expect an mnp  modem to transfer at about      the normal data rate of the modem  details of mnp   through   were later released and became popular on a series of       bit s modems  mnp was ultimately replaced by the v    and v   bis itu standards  v    and v   bis were not compatible with mnp but were similar in concept     another common feature of these high speed modems was the concept of fallback  or speed hunting  allowing them to communicate with less capable modems  during the call initiation  the modem would transmit a series of signals and wait for the remote modem to respond  they would start at high speeds and get progressively slower until there was a response  thus  two usr modems would be able to connect at      xa bit s  but  when a user with a      xa bit s modem called in  the usr would fall back to the common      xa bit s speed  this would also happen if a v    modem and a hst modem were connected  because they used a different standard at      xa bit s  they would fall back to their highest commonly supported standard at      xa bit s  the same applies to v   bis and       xa bit s hst modem  which would still be able to communicate with each other at      xa bit s     in       gottfried ungerboeck from ibm zurich research laboratory applied channel coding techniques to search for new ways to increase the speed of modems  his results were astonishing but only conveyed to a few colleagues   in       he agreed to publish what is now a landmark paper in the theory of information coding citation needed by applying parity check coding to the bits in each symbol  and mapping the encoded bits into a two dimensional diamond pattern  ungerboeck showed that it was possible to increase the speed by a factor of two with the same error rate  the new technique was called mapping by set partitions  now known as trellis modulation     error correcting codes  which encode code words  sets of bits  in such a way that they are far from each other  so that in case of error they are still closest to the original word  and not confused with another  can be thought of as analogous to sphere packing or packing pennies on a surface  the further two bit sequences are from one another  the easier it is to correct minor errors     v   bis was so successful that the older high speed standards had little to recommend them  usr fought back with a       xa bit s version of hst  while at t introduced a one off       xa bit s method they referred to as v   ter  but neither non standard modem sold well     any interest in these systems was destroyed during the lengthy introduction of the       xa bit s v    standard  while waiting  several companies decided to release hardware and introduced modems they referred to as v fast  in order to guarantee compatibility with v    modems once the standard was ratified         the manufacturers were forced to use more flexible parts  generally a dsp and microcontroller  as opposed to purpose designed asic modem chips     today  the itu standard v    represents the culmination of the joint efforts  it employs the most powerful coding techniques including channel encoding and shape encoding  from the mere   bits per symbol     xa kbit s   the new standards used the functional equivalent of   to    bits per symbol  plus increasing baud rates from       to        to create             and     xa kbit s modems  this rate is near the theoretical shannon limit  when calculated  the shannon capacity of a narrowband line is   with  the  linear  signal to noise ratio  narrowband phone lines have a bandwidth of     xa hz so using   snr     xa db   the capacity is approximately   xa kbit s      without the discovery and eventual application of trellis modulation  maximum telephone rates using voice bandwidth channels would have been limited to      xa baud    xa bit symbol   approximately   xa kbit s using traditional qam     the v    standard introduced analog simultaneous voice and data  asvd   this technology allowed users of v    modems to engage in point to point voice conversations with each other while their respective modems communicated     in       the first dsvd  digital simultaneous voice and data  modems became available to consumers  and the standard was ratified as v    by the international telecommunication union  itu  in          two dsvd modems can establish a completely digital link between each other over standard phone lines  sometimes referred to as  the poor man s isdn   and employing a similar technology  v    compatible modems allow for a maximum speed of      kbit s between peers  by using a majority of the bandwidth for data and reserving part for voice transmission  dsvd modems allow users to pick up a telephone handset interfaced with the modem  and initiate a call to the other peer     one practical use for this technology was realized by early two player video gamers  who could hold voice communication with each other over the phone while playing     during the late     s  rockwell lucent and usrobotics introduced competing technologies based upon the digital transmission used in telephony networks  the standard digital transmission in modern networks is   xa kbit s but some networks use a part of the bandwidth for remote office signaling  e g  to hang up the phone   limiting the effective rate to   xa kbit s ds   this new technology was adopted into itu standards v    and is common in modern computers  the   xa kbit s rate is only possible from the central office to the user site  downlink   in the united states  government regulation limits the maximum power output  resulting in a maximum data rate of     xa kbit s  the uplink  from the user to the central office  still uses v    technology at     xa kbit s  usrobotics began work on the technology first  calling theirs x  because   k was twice the speed of   k modems   usrobotics held a    percent share of the retail modem market  and rockwell international held an    percent share of the modem chipset market   concerned with being shut out of the market  rockwell began work on a rival   k technology and joined with lucent and motorola on what it called k  flex or flex   both technologies both reached the market around february       although problems with k  flex modems were noted in product reviews through july  within six months they worked equally well with variations dependent on local connection characteristics   the retail price of the   k modems was about       compared to      for   k modems   separate equipment was required by internet service providers  isps  to support the incompatible technologies  with costs varying depending on whether their current equipment could be upgraded   about half of all isps offered   k support by october        consumer sales were relatively low  which usrobotics and rockwell attributed to confliting standards      the international telecommunication union  itu  announced the draft of a new    kbit s standard  v     in february      with strong industry support   incompatible with either existing standard   it was an amalgam of both which was designed to allow both types of modem to be converted to it by a firmware upgrade  this v    standard was approved in september       and widely adopted by isps and consumers      later in v     the digital pcm technique was applied to increase the upload speed to a maximum of   xa kbit s  but at the expense of download rates  a   xa kbit s upstream rate would reduce the downstream as low as   xa kbit s due to echo on the telephone line  to avoid this problem  v    modems offer the option to turn off the digital upstream and instead use a     xa kbit s analog connection  in order to maintain a high digital downstream of   xa kbit s or higher   v    also adds two other features  the first is the ability for users who have call waiting to put their dial up internet connection on hold for extended periodsvague of time while they answer a call  the second feature is the ability to quickly connect to one s isp  this is achieved by remembering the analog and digital characteristics of the telephone line  and using this saved information when reconnecting     today s v     v   bis and v    standards allow the modem to transmit data faster than its basic rate would imply  for instance  a      kbit s connection with v    can transmit up to               kbit s using pure text original research  however  the compression ratio tends to vary due to noise on the line  or due to the transfer of already compressed files  zip files  jpeg images  mp  audio  mpeg video    at some points the modem will be sending compressed files at approximately    kbit s  uncompressed files at     kbit s  and pure text at     kbit s  or any value in between      in such situations a small amount of memory in the modem  a buffer  is used to hold the data while it is being compressed and sent across the phone line  but in order to prevent overflow of the buffer  it sometimes becomes necessary to tell the computer to pause the datastream  this is accomplished through hardware flow control using extra lines on the modem computer connection  the computer is then set to supply the modem at some higher rate  such as     kbit s  and the modem will tell the computer when to start or stop sending data     as telephone based   k modems began losing popularity  some internet service providers such as netzero juno  netscape  and others started using pre compression to increase the throughput and maintain their customer base  the server side compression operates much more efficiently than the on the fly compression done by modems due to the fact these compression techniques are application specific  jpeg  text  exe  etc    the website text  images  and flash executables are compacted to approximately          and      respectively  the drawback of this approach is a loss in quality  which causes image content to become pixelated and smeared  isps employing this approach often advertise it as  accelerated dial up      these accelerated downloads are now integrated into the opera and amazon silk web browsers  using their own server side text and image compression     a winmodem or softmodem is a stripped down modem that replaces tasks traditionally handled in hardware with software  in this case the modem is a simple interface designed to act as a digital to analog and an analog to digital converter  softmodems are cheaper than traditional modems because they have fewer hardware components  however  the software generating and interpreting the modem tones to be sent to the softmodem uses many system resources  for online gaming  this can be a real concern  another problem is the lack of cross platform compatibility  meaning that non windows operating systems  such as linux  often do not have an equivalent driver to operate the modem     these values are maximum values  and actual values may be slower under certain conditions  for example  noisy phone lines    for a complete list see the companion article list of device bandwidths  a baud is one symbol per second  each symbol may encode one or more data bits     a cea study in      found that dial up internet access is declining in the u s  in       dial up internet connections accounted for     of all u s  residential internet connections citation needed the us demographic pattern for dial up modem users per capita has been more or less mirrored in canada and australia for the past    years     dial up modem use in the us had dropped to     by       and in      stood at     citation needed voiceband modems were once the most popular means of internet access in the u s   but with the advent of new ways of accessing the internet  the traditional   k modem is losing popularity  the dial up modem is still widely used by customers in rural areas  where dsl  cable or fiber optic service is not available  or they are unwilling to pay what these companies charge    aol in its      annual report showed it still collects around      million in fees from dial up users  about   million people     direct broadcast satellite  wifi  and mobile phones all use modems to communicate  as do most other wireless services today  modern telecommunications and data networks also make extensive use of radio modems where long distance data links are required  such systems are an important part of the pstn  and are also in common use for high speed computer network links to outlying areas where fibre is not economical     even where a cable is installed  it is often possible to get better performance or make other parts of the system simpler by using radio frequencies and modulation techniques through a cable  coaxial cable has a very large bandwidth  however signal attenuation becomes a major problem at high data rates if a baseband digital signal is used  by using a modem  a much larger amount of digital data can be transmitted through a single wire  digital cable television and cable internet services use radio frequency modems to provide the increasing bandwidth needs of modern households  using a modem also allows for frequency division multiple access to be used  making full duplex digital communication with many users possible using a single wire     wireless modems come in a variety of types  bandwidths  and speeds  wireless modems are often referred to as transparent or smart  they transmit information that is modulated onto a carrier frequency to allow many simultaneous wireless communication links to work simultaneously on different frequencies     transparent modems operate in a manner similar to their phone line modem cousins  typically  they were half duplex  meaning that they could not send and receive data at the same time  typically transparent modems are polled in a round robin manner to collect small amounts of data from scattered locations that do not have easy access to wired infrastructure  transparent modems are most commonly used by utility companies for data collection     smart modems come with media access controllers inside  which prevents random data from colliding and resends data that is not correctly received  smart modems typically require more bandwidth than transparent modems  and typically achieve higher data rates  the ieee        standard defines a short range modulation scheme that is used on a large scale throughout the world     the wifi and wimax standards use wireless mobile broadband modems operating at microwave frequencies     modems which use a mobile telephone system  gprs  umts  hspa  evdo  wimax  etc    are known as mobile broadband modems  sometimes also called wireless modems   wireless modems can be embedded inside a laptop or appliance  or be external to it  external wireless modems are connect cards  usb modems for mobile broadband and cellular routers  a connect card is a pc card or expresscard which slides into a pcmcia pc card expresscard slot on a computer  usb wireless modems use a usb port on the laptop instead of a pc card or expresscard slot  a usb modem used for mobile broadband internet is also sometimes referred to as a dongle    a cellular router may have an external datacard  aircard  that slides into it  most cellular routers do allow such datacards or usb modems  cellular routers may not be modems by definition  but they contain modems or allow modems to be slid into them  the difference between a cellular router and a wireless modem is that a cellular router normally allows multiple people to connect to it  since it can route data or support multipoint to multipoint connections   while a modem is designed for one connection     most of gsm wireless modems come with an integrated sim cardholder  i e   huawei e     sierra      etc   and some models are also provided with a microsd memory slot and or jack for additional external antenna such as huawei e     and sierra wireless compass          the cdma  evdo  versions do not use r uim cards  but use electronic serial number  esn  instead     the cost of using a wireless modem varies from country to country  some carriers implement flat rate plans for unlimited data transfers  some have caps  or maximum limits  on the amount of data that can be transferred per month  other countries have plans that charge a fixed rate per data transferred per megabyte or even kilobyte of data downloaded  this tends to add up quickly in today s content filled world  which is why many peoplewho  are pushing for flat data rates     the faster data rates of the newest wireless modem technologies  umts  hspa  evdo  wimax  are also considered to be broadband wireless modems and compete with other broadband modems below     until the end of april       worldwide shipments of usb modems surpassed embedded  g and  g modules by     because usb modems can be easily discarded  but embedded modems could start to gain popularity as tablet sales grow and as the incremental cost of the modems shrinks  so by      the ratio may change to           like mobile phones  mobile broadband modems can be sim locked to a particular network provider  unlocking a modem is achieved the same way as unlocking a phone  by using an  unlock code      adsl  asymmetric digital subscriber line  modems  a more recent development  are not limited to the telephone s voiceband audio frequencies  early proprietary adsl modems used carrierless amplitude phase  cap  modulation  all standardized asymmetric dsl variants  including ansi t      issue    g dmt  adsl   adsl    vdsl   and g fast  use discrete multi tone  dmt  modulation  also called  coded  orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  ofdm or cofdm      standard twisted pair telephone cable can  for short distances  carry signals with much higher frequencies than the cable s maximum frequency rating  adsl broadband takes advantage of this capability  however  adsl s performance gradually declines as the telephone cable s length increases  this limits adsl broadband service to subscribers within a relatively short distance from the telephone exchange     cable modems use a range of radio frequencies originally intended to carry television signals  a single cable can carry radio and television signals at the same time as broadband internet service without interference  multiple cable modems attached to a single cable can use the same frequency band by employing a low level media access protocol to avoid conflicts  in the prevalent docsis system  frequency division duplexing  fdd  separates uplink and downlink signals  for a single cable distribution system  the return signals from customers require bidirectional amplifiers or reverse path amplifiers that send specific customer frequency bands upstream to the cable plant amongst the downstream frequency bands     newer types of broadband modems are available  including satellite and power line modems     most consumers did not know about networking and routers when broadband became available  however  many people knew that a modem connected a computer to the internet over a telephone line  to take advantage of consumers  familiarity with modems  companies called these devices broadband modems rather use less familiar terms such as adapter  interface  transceiver  or bridge  in fact  broadband modems fit the definition of modem because they use complex waveforms to carry digital data  they use more advanced technology than dial up modems  typically they can modulate and demodulate hundreds of channels simultaneously or use much wider channels than dial up modems     some devices referred to as  broadband modems  are residential gateways  integrating the functions of a modem  network address translation  nat  router  ethernet switch  wifi access point  dhcp server  firewall  among others  some residential gateway offer a so called  bridged mode   which disables the built in routing function and makes the device function similarly to a plain modem  this bridged mode is separate from rfc      bridging     although the name modem is seldom used in this case  modems are also used for high speed home networking applications  especially those using existing home wiring  one example is the g hn standard  developed by itu t  which provides a high speed  up to  xa gbit s  local area network using existing home wiring  power lines  phone lines and coaxial cables   g hn devices use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  ofdm  to modulate a digital signal for transmission over the wire     the phrase  null modem  was used to describe attaching a specially wired cable between the serial ports of two personal computers  basically  the transmit output of one computer was wired to the receive input of the other  this was true for both computers  the same software used with modems  such as procomm or minicom  could be used with the null modem connection     many modern modems have their origin in deep space telecommunications systems from the     s     differences between deep space telecom modems and landline modems include     voice modems are regular modems that are capable of recording or playing audio over the telephone line  they are used for telephony applications  see voice modem command set for more details on voice modems  this type of modem can be used as an fxo card for private branch exchange systems  compare v          others
