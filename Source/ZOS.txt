 z os is a    bit operating system for mainframe computers  produced by ibm  it derives from and is the successor to os      which in turn followed a string of mvs versions nb   like os      z os combines a number of formerly separate  related products  some of which are still optional  z os offers the attributes of modern operating systems but also retains much of the functionality originating in the     s and each subsequent decade that is still found in daily use  backward compatibility is one of z os s central design philosophies   z os was first introduced in october        the newest version is z os version   release               z os supports stable mainframe systems and standards such as cics  ims  db   racf  sna  websphere mq  record oriented data access methods  rexx  clist  smp e  jcl  tso e  and ispf  among others  however  z os also supports    bit java  c  c    and unix  single unix specification  apis and applications through unix system services xa   the open group certifies z os as a compliant unix operating systemxa   with unix linux style hierarchical hfsnb   and zfs file systems  as a result  z os hosts a broad range of commercial and open source software of any vintage   z os can communicate directly via tcp ip  including ipv    and includes standard http servers  one from lotus  the other apache derived  along with other common services such as ftp  nfs  and cifs smb  another central design philosophy is support for extremely high quality of service  qos   even within a single operating system instance  although z os has built in support for parallel sysplex clustering     z os has a workload manager  wlm  and dispatcher which automatically manages numerous concurrently hosted units of work running in separate key protected address spaces according to dynamically adjustable goals  this capability inherently supports multi tenancy within a single operating system image  however  modern ibm mainframes also offer two additional levels of virtualization  lpars and  optionally  z vm  these new functions within the hardware  z os  and z vm   and linux and opensolaris support   have encouraged development of new applications for mainframes  many of them utilize the websphere application server for z os middleware     from its inception z os has supported tri modal addressing     bit     bit  and    bit   up through version      z os itself could start in either    bit esa     or    bit z architecture mode  so it could function on older hardware albeit without    bit application support on those machines   only the newer z architecture hardware manufactured starting in the year      can run    bit code   ibm support for z os     ended on march           now z os is only supported on z architecture mainframes and only runs in    bit mode  z architecture hardware always starts running in    bit mode  but current z os releases quickly switch to    bit mode and will not run on hardware that does not support    bit mode  application programmers can still use any addressing mode  all applications  regardless of their addressing mode s   can coexist without modification  and ibm maintains commitment to tri modal backward compatibility  however  increasing numbers of middleware products and applications  such as db  version   and above  now require and exploit    bit addressing     ibm markets z os as its flagship  operating system  suited for continuous  high volume operation with high security and stability     z os is available under standard license pricing as well as via system z new application license charges  znalc  and  system z solution edition   two lower priced offerings aimed at supporting newer applications   new workloads     u s  standard commercial z os pricing starts at about      per month  including support  for the smallest znalc installation running the base z os product plus a typical set of optional z os features     z os introduced variable workload license charges  vwlc  and entry workload license charges  ewlc  which are sub capacity billing options  vwlc and ewlc customers only pay for peak monthly z os usage  not for full machine capacity as with the previous os     operating system  vwlc and ewlc are also available for most ibm software products running on z os  and their peaks are separately calculated but can never exceed the z os peak  to be eligible for sub capacity licensing  a z os customer must be running in    bit mode  which requires z architecture hardware   must have completely eliminated os     from the system  and must e mail ibm monthly sub capacity reports  sub capacity billing substantially reduces software charges for most ibm mainframe customers   advanced workload license charges  awlc  is the successor to vwlc on mainframe models starting with the zenterprise      and eawlc is an option on zenterprise     models  awlc and eawlc offer further sub capacity discounts     within each address space  z os typically only permits the placement of data above the  xa gb  bar   not code  z os enforces this distinction primarily for performance reasons  there are no architectural impediments to allowing more than  xa gb of application code per address space  ibm has started to allow java code running on z os to execute above the  xa gb bar  again for performance reasons     memory is obtained as  large memory objects  in multiples of  xa mb  with the expectation that applications and middleware will manage memory allocation within these large pieces   there are three types of large memory objects     ibms release scheduling introduces new releases of z os each september     ibm supports z os release coexistence and fallback on an  n    basis  for example  ibm customers running release   can upgrade directly to release    or release     and both releases can operate concurrently within the same sysplex  cluster  and without conflict using the same datasets  configurations  security profiles  etc   coexistence   as long as so called  toleration maintenance  is installed in the older release  if there is a problem with release     the customer can return to release   without experiencing dataset  configuration  or security profile compatibility problems  fallback  until ready to try moving forward again  z os customers using parallel sysplex  clustering  can operate n   releases  e g  release   and release     or release   and release     in mixed release configurations  in production  as long as required to complete release upgrades  supported release mixing within a cluster is one of the key strategies of z os for avoiding service outages     ibm s standard support period for each z os release is three years  most z os customers take advantage of the n   support model  and skip every other release  thus most z os customers are either  odd  or  even       ibm releases individual small enhancements and correctionsnb    a k a  ptfs  for z os as needed  when needed  ibm labels critical ptfs as  hiper   high impact pervasive   ibm also  rolls up  multiple patches into a recommended service update  rsu   rsus are released periodically  in the range of every one to three months  and undergo additional testing  although z os customers vary in their maintenance practices  ibm encourages every z os customer to adopt a reasonable preventive maintenance strategy  to avoid known problems before they might occur
