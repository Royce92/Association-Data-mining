 application software  an application  is a set of one or more programs designed to permit the user to perform a group of coordinated functions  tasks  or activities  application software cannot run on itself but is dependent on system software to execute  examples of an application include a word processor  a spreadsheet design and management system  an aeronautical flight simulator  a console game  a drawing  painting  and illustrating system  or a library management system       the term is used to distinguish such software from another type of computer program referred to as system software  which manages and integrates a computer s capabilities but does not directly perform tasks that benefit the user  the system software serves the application  which in turn serves the user     examples of types of application software may include accounting software  media players  and office suites  many application programs deal principally with documents  applications may be bundled with the computer and its system software or published separately  and may be coded as e g  proprietary  open source or university projects  dead link            in information technology  an application is a computer program designed to help people perform an activity  an application thus differs from an operating system  which runs a computer   a utility  which performs maintenance or general purpose chores   and a programming tool  with which computer programs are created original research   depending on the activity for which it was designed  an application can manipulate text  numbers  graphics  or a combination of these elements  some application packages focus on a single task  such as word processing  others  called integrated software include several applications      user written software tailors systems to meet the user s specific needs  user written software includes spreadsheet templates  word processor macros  scientific simulations  graphics and animation scripts  even email filters are a kind of user software  users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is     the delineation between system software such as operating systems and application software is not exact  however  and is occasionally the object of controversy  for example  one of the key questions in the united states v  microsoft antitrust trial was whether microsoft s internet explorer web browser was part of its windows operating system or a separable piece of application software  as another example  the gnu linux naming controversy is  in part  due to disagreement about the relationship between the linux kernel and the operating systems built over this kernel  in some types of embedded systems  the application software and the operating system software may be indistinguishable to the user  as in the case of software used to control a vcr  dvd player or microwave oven  the above definitions may exclude some applications that may exist on some computers in large organizations  for an alternative definition of an app  see application portfolio management     some applications are available in versions for several different platforms  others have narrower requirements and are thus called  for example  a geography application for windows  an android application for education  or linux gaming  sometimes a new and popular application arises which only runs on one platform  increasing the desirability of that platform  this is called a killer application or killer app     in recent years  the shortened term  app   coined in      or earlier   has become popular to refer to applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets  the shortened form matching their typically smaller scope compared to applications on pcs     there are many different ways to divide up different types of application software  and several are explained here     since the development and near universal adoption of the web  an important distinction that has emerged has been between web applications   written with html  javascript and other web native technologies and typically requiring one to be online and running a web browser  and the more traditional native applications written in whatever languages are available for one s particular type of computer  there has been contentious debate in the computing community regarding web applications replacing native applications for many purposes  especially on mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets  web apps have indeed greatly increased in popularity for some uses  but the advantages of applications make them unlikely to disappear soon  if ever  furthermore  the two can be complementary  and even integrated        application software can also be seen as being either horizontal or vertical     horizontal applications are more popular and widespread  because they are general purpose  for example word processors or databases  vertical applications are niche products  designed for a particular type of industry or business  or department within an organization  integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of  for example  manufacturing or banking systems  or accounting  or customer service     there are many types of application software     applications can also be classified by computing platform such as a particular operating system  delivery network such as in cloud computing and web     applications  or delivery devices such as mobile apps for mobile devices     the operating system itself can be considered application software when performing simple calculating  measuring  rendering  and word processing tasks not used to control hardware via command line interface or graphical user interface  this does not include application software bundled within operating systems such as a software calculator or text editor
