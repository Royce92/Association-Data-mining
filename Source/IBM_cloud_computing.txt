 ibm cloud computing is using for a set of cloud computing services for business offered by the information technology company ibm  all offerings used to be marketed under the name ibm smartcloud  ibm cloud includes infrastructure as a service  iaas   software as a service  saas  and platform as a service  paas  offered through public  private and hybrid cloud delivery models  in addition to the components that make up those clouds             ibm offers three hardware platforms for cloud computing   these platforms offer built in support for virtualization  for virtualization ibm offers ibm websphere application infrastructure solutions that support programming models and open standards for virtualization     the management layer of the ibm cloud framework includes ibm tivoli middleware   management tools provide capabilities to regulate images with automated provisioning and de provisioning  monitor operations and meter usage while tracking costs and allocating billing  the last layer of the framework provides integrated workload tools   workloads for cloud computing are services or instances of code that can be executed to meet specific business needs   ibm offers tools for cloud based collaboration  development and test  application development  analytics  business to business integration  and security      ibm cloud computing emerged from the union of its mainframe computing and virtualization technologies  known as the original virtualization company   ibm s first experiments in virtualization occurred in the     s with the development of the virtual machine  vm  on cp    and cp    operating systems  cp     a hypervisor used for software testing and development  enabled memory sharing across vms while giving each user their own virtual memory space  with the machine partitioned into separate vms  mainframes could run multiple applications and processes at the same time  making the hardware more efficient and cost effective   ibm began selling vm technology for the mainframe in           in february       ibm released power processor based servers  the servers  in combination with the ibm mainframe  were built for complex and mission critical virtualization  power systems servers include powervm hypervisors with live partition mobility and active memory sharing  live migration was introduced with power  in may       next  ibm looked to implement standardization and automation in their technology in order to keep up with the proliferation of data produced by increasingly efficient hardware and data centers  this combination of virtualization  standardization and automation led to the development of ibm cloud computing      ibm began to develop a strategy for cloud computing in       announcing that it planned to build clouds for enterprise clients and provide services to fill what it regarded as gaps in existing cloud environments   in october       ibm announced a partnership with google to promote cloud computing in universities  in addition to donating hardware and machines  the two companies also provided a curriculum to teach students about cloud computing       ibm claimed in april      that     of fortune     companies were using ibm cloud  and that their software and services were used by more than    million end user customers  with clients including american airlines  aviva  carfax  frito lay  indiafirst life insurance company  and   eleven       on   june      ibm announced its acquisition of softlayer  to form an ibm cloud services division         the ibm smartcloud brand includes infrastructure as a service  software as a service and platform as a service offered through public  private and hybrid cloud delivery models  ibm places these offerings under three umbrellas  smartcloud foundation  smartcloud services and smartcloud solutions       smartcloud foundation consists of the infrastructure  hardware  provisioning  management  integration and security that serve as the underpinnings of a private or hybrid cloud  built using those foundational components  paas  iaas and backup services make up smartcloud services  running on this cloud platform and infrastructure  smartcloud solutions consist of a number of collaboration  analytics and marketing saas applications     ibm also builds cloud environments for clients that are not necessarily on the smartcloud platform  for example  features of the smartcloud platform such as tivoli management software or ibm systems director virtualization can be integrated separately as part of a non ibm cloud platform  the smartcloud platform consists solely of ibm hardware  software  services and practices     ibm smartcloud enterprise and smartcloud enterprise  compete with products like those of rackspace and amazon web services  erich clementi  vice president of global technology services at ibm  said in      that the goal with smartcloud enterprise and smartcloud enterprise  was to provide an amazon ec  like experience primarily for test and development purposes and to provide a more robust experience for production workloads         in       ibm smartcloud integrated hadoop based infosphere biginsights for big data    green hat for software testing   and nirvanix   for cloud storage  in       the then new ceo virginia rometty said the company planned to spend     billion on acquisitions by            users may build their own private cloud or purchase services hosted on the ibm cloud  users may also purchase ibm hardware  software and services to build their customized cloud environment     by       the name smartcloud has been replaced with products that have a prefix of  ibm cloud   a product called ibm cloud manager with openstack would be ibm s integration of openstack along with a multitude of value additions that would serve enterprise customers  a product called ibm cloud orchestrator would serve the orchestration needs of an enterprise  the aforementioned smartcloud products have been discontinued     ibm offers cloud delivery options including solely private cloud  solely public cloud  and variations in between  private  public and hybrid clouds are not strictly distinct  as ibm allows the option to build a customized cloud solution out of a combination of public cloud and private cloud elements  companies that prefer to keep all data and processes behind their own firewall can use private cloud services managed by their own it staff  a company may also choose pay as you go pricing  hybrid cloud options allow for some processes to be hosted and managed by ibm  while others are kept on a private cloud or on a vpn or vlan  ibm also offers planning and consultation throughout the deployment process  ibm offers five cloud provision models     the majority of cloud users choose a hybrid cloud model  with some workloads being served by internal systems  some from commercial cloud providers and some from public cloud service providers       on august           ibm announced the release of a new hybrid cloud model orchestrated by ibm websphere cast iron integration of on  and off premise resources    enterprises can use cast iron integration to link their public cloud appliances  hosted on environments like amazon ec   google apps  salesforce com  oracle crm  sugarcrm and a number of others to their existing systems or in house  private cloud environments    cast iron integration aims to reduce the time and effort needed for customized coding  in favor of simple workload provisioning through tivoli       the ibm public cloud offering  smartcloud enterprise  was launched on april          sce is hosted iaas with service level agreements  sla s  and can be offered in a private  public or hybrid model  the environment is hosted on ibm servers  system p or system x   with a standard set of software images to choose from       for customers who perceive that the security risk of cloud computing adoption is too high  ibm offers private cloud services  ideas international wrote in a white paper   ibm believes that its clients are currently more comfortable with private clouds than public or hybrid clouds  and that many are ready to deploy fundamental business applications in private clouds     for building strictly private clouds  ibm offers ibm workload deployer and cloudburst as ready to deploy   cloud in a box  style solutions  cloudburst provides blade servers  middleware and virtualization for an enterprise to build its own cloud ready virtual machines  workload deployer connects an enterprise s existing servers to virtualization components and middleware in order to help deploy standardized virtual machines designed by ibm    for customers who prefer to perform their own integration of private clouds  ibm offers a choice of hardware and software building blocks  along with recommendations and a reference architecture  prior to deployment  clients may choose from ibm virtualization enabled servers  middleware and saas applications     ibm participates in several cloud standards initiatives within various standards development organizations involved in cloud service models iaas  paas and saas  all of which work toward improvements in cloud interoperability and security     ibm is a member of the open group  a council that works for the development of open  vendor neutral it standards and certifications  other members of the group include hp  oracle  sap and numerous others    ibm contributed the cloud computing reference architecture in february      to the open group as the basis of an industry wide cloud architecture  ibm s ccra is based on real world input from many cloud implementations across ibm  it is intended to be used as a blueprint guide for architecting cloud implementations  driven by functional and non functional requirements of the respective cloud implementation  hp and microsoft have also published cloud computing reference architectures       within the iaas space  ibm is a member of the cloud management work group  cmwg    within the distributed management task force  dmtf   which released a draft version of their iaas apis  called the cloud infrastructure management interface  cimi   on september             the cimi apis define a logical model for the management of resources within the infrastructure as a service domain  with these apis  clients can create  manage and connect machines  volumes and networks     for paas and saas standards  ibm  red hat  cisco  citrix  emc and others contribute to the topology and orchestration specification for cloud applications  tosca  technical committee within organization for the advancement of structured information standards  oasis     which aims to provide a standardized way of managing the lifecycle of cloud services  for portability of cloud based applications  tosca s goal is to advance an interoperability standard that will make it easier to deploy cloud applications without vendor lock in  while maintaining application requirements for security  governance  and compliance       ibm participates in a number of cloud security related standards including the dmtf cloud auditing data federation  cadf  working group    and the oasis identity in the cloud  idcloud  technical committee  cadf is designed to address the need for a cloud provider to provide specific audit event  log and report information on a per tenant and application basis  idcloud aims to addresses the serious security challenges posed by identity management in cloud computing and investigates the need for profiles to achieve interoperability within current standards     ibm founded the cloud standards customer council  cscc  in april         with the object management group  omg  kaavo  rackspace and software ag  as an end user advocacy group that aimed to accelerate adoption of cloud services and eliminate barriers to security and interoperability associated with the transition to the cloud  in addition to contributing standards requirements to various standards development organizations  sdo   the cscc also creates guides that companies can use on their own path to cloud adoption       october         october         august         july         june         april         november         october
