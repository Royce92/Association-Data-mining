 vm  often  vm cms  is a family of ibm virtual machine operating systems used on ibm mainframes system      system      zseries  system z and compatible systems  including the hercules emulator for personal computers  the first version  released in       was vm      or officially virtual machine facility      this was a system     reimplementation of earlier cp cms operating system  milestone versions included vm sp   the current version  z vm  is still widely used as one of the main full virtualization solutions for the mainframe market citation needed            the heart of the vm architecture is a control program or hypervisor called vm cp  usually  cp  sometimes  ambiguously  vm   it runs on the physical hardware  and creates the virtual machine environment  vm cp provides full virtualization of the physical machine   including all i o and other privileged operations  it performs the system s resource sharing  including device management  dispatching  virtual storage management  and other traditional operating system tasks  each vm user is provided with a separate virtual machine having its own address space  virtual devices  etc   and which is capable of running any software that could be run on a stand alone machine  a given vm mainframe typically runs hundreds or thousands of virtual machine instances  vm cp began life as cp      a reimplementation of cp     itself a reimplementation of cp        running within each virtual machine is another   guest  operating system  this might be     at one time  cms was capable of running on a bare machine  as a true operating system  though such a configuration would be unusual   it now only runs as a guest os under vm  this is because cms relies on a hypervisor interface to vm cp  to perform file system operations and request other vm services  this paravirtualization interface     the term  hypervisor  was probably coined during ibm s implementation of vm      when it was used to refer to the virtual diag handler     the early history of vm is described in the articles cp cms and history of cp cms  vm     was a reimplementation of cp cms  and was made available in      as part of ibm s  system     advanced function  announcement  which added virtual memory hardware and operating systems to the system     series   early releases of vm through vm     release   continued in open source  and today are considered to be in the public domain  this policy ended in the late     s with the chargeable vm se and vm bse upgrades and in      with vm system product  vm sp   however  ibm continued providing updates in source form for existing code for many years     vm remained an important platform within ibm  used for operating system development and time sharing use  but for customers it remained ibm s  other operating system   the os and dos families remained ibm s strategic products  and customers were not encouraged to run vm  those that did formed close working relationships  continuing the community support model of early cp cms users  in the meantime  the system struggled with political infighting within ibm over what resources should be available to the project  as compared with other ibm efforts  a basic  problem  with the system was seen at ibm s field sales level  vm cms demonstrably reduced the amount of hardware needed to support a given number of time sharing users  ibm was  after all  in the business of selling computer systems     melinda varian provides this fascinating quote  illustrating vm s unexpected success     the marketing forecasts for vm     predicted that no more than one     would ever run vm during the entire life of the product  in fact  the first     delivered to a customer ran only cp and cms  ten years later  ten percent of the large processors being shipped from poughkeepsie would be destined to run vm  as would a very substantial portion of the mid range machines that were built in endicott  before fifteen years had passed  there would be more vm licenses than mvs licenses      a pc dos version that ran on the xt      and later on the at      was called vm pc  vm pc     was based on vm sp release       vm s role changed within ibm when hardware evolution led to significant changes in processor architecture  backward compatibility remained a cornerstone of the ibm mainframe family  which still used the basic instruction set introduced with the original system      but the need for efficient use of the    bit zseries made the vm approach much more attractive  vm was also utilized in data centers converting from dos vse to mvs and is useful when running mainframe aix and linux  platforms that were to become increasingly important  the current z vm platform has finally achieved the recognition within ibm that vm users long felt it deserved  some z vm sites run thousands of simultaneous virtual machine users on a single system  z vm was first released in october       and remains in active use and development     ibm and third parties have offered many applications and tools that run under vm  examples include ramis  focus  spss  nomad  db   rexx  racf  and officevision  current vm offerings run the gamut of mainframe applications  including http servers  database managers  analysis tools  engineering packages  and financial systems     in the early     s  the vm group within share  the ibm user group  sought a mascot or logo for the community to adopt  this was in part a response to ibm s mvs users selecting the turkey as a mascot  hilariously chosen  according to legend  by the mvs performance group in the early days of mvs  when its performance was a sore topic   in       the teddy bear became vm s de facto mascot at share     when teddy bear stickers were attached to the nametags of  cuddlier oldtimers  to flag them for newcomers as  friendly if approached   the bears were a hit and soon appeared widely   bears were awarded to inductees of the  order of the knights of vm   individuals who made  useful contributions  to the community
