 capitalism is an economic system and a mode of production in which trade  industries  and the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned and operated for profit    central characteristics of capitalism include private property  capital accumulation  wage labour and  in many models  competitive markets   in a capitalist economy  the parties to a transaction typically determine the prices at which assets  goods  and services are exchanged      the degree of competition  role of intervention and regulation  and scope of state ownership varies across different models of capitalism   economists  political economists  and historians have taken different perspectives in their analysis of capitalism and recognized various forms of it in practice  these include laissez faire capitalism  welfare capitalism  crony capitalism and state capitalism  each highlighting varying degrees of dependency on markets  public ownership  and inclusion of social policies  the extent to which different markets are free  as well as the rules defining private property  is a matter of politics and policy  many states have what are termed capitalist mixed economies  referring to a mix between planned and market driven elements   capitalism has existed under many forms of government  in many different times  places  and cultures   following the demise of feudalism  capitalism became the dominant economic system in the western world             other terms sometimes used for capitalism     the term capitalist as referring to an owner of capital  rather than its meaning of someone adherent to the economic system  shows earlier recorded use than the term capitalism  dating back to the mid   th century  capitalist is derived from capital  which evolved from capitale  a late latin word based on caput  meaning  head    also the origin of chattel and cattle in the sense of movable property  only much later to refer only to livestock   capitale emerged in the   th to   th centuries in the sense of referring to funds  stock of merchandise  sum of money  or money carrying interest        by      it was used in the sense of the capital assets of a trading firm  it was frequently interchanged with a number of other words   wealth  money  funds  goods  assets  property  and so on       the hollandische mercurius uses capitalists in      and      to refer to owners of capital    in french   tienne clavier referred to capitalistes in         six years before its first recorded english usage by arthur young in his work travels in france             david ricardo  in his principles of political economy and taxation         referred to  the capitalist  many times    samuel taylor coleridge  an english poet  used capitalist in his work table talk           pierre joseph proudhon used the term capitalist in his first work  what is property         to refer to the owners of capital  benjamin disraeli used the term capitalist in his      work sybil       the initial usage of the term capitalism in its modern sense has been attributed to louis blanc in      and pierre joseph proudhon in         karl marx and friedrich engels referred to the capitalistic system      and to the capitalist mode of production in das kapital           the use of the word  capitalism  in reference to an economic system appears twice in volume i of das kapital  p xa      german edition   and in theories of surplus value  tome ii  p xa      german edition   marx did not extensively use the form capitalism  but instead those of capitalist and capitalist mode of production  which appear more than      times in the trilogy das kapital     according to the oxford english dictionary  oed   the term capitalism first appeared in english in      in the novel the newcomes  by novelist william makepeace thackeray  where he meant  having ownership of capital     also according to the oed  carl adolph douai  a german american socialist and abolitionist  used the term private capitalism in          the relationship between democracy and capitalism is a contentious area in theory and popular political movements  the extension of universal adult male suffrage in   th century britain occurred along with the development of industrial capitalism  and democracy became widespread at the same time as capitalism  leading capitalists to posit a causal relationship between them  or that each affects the other  however  in the   th century  according to some authors  capitalism also accompanied a variety of political formations quite distinct from liberal democracies  including fascist regimes  absolute monarchies  and single party states    however  critics of the democratic peace theory note that democratic capitalist states may fight infrequently and or never with other democratic capitalist states because of political similarity or stability rather than because they are democratic or capitalist     moderate critics argue that though economic growth under capitalism has led to democratisation in the past  it may not do so in the future  as authoritarian regimes have been able to manage economic growth without making concessions to greater political freedom         states that have highly capitalistic economic systems have thrived under authoritarian or oppressive political systems  singapore  which maintains a highly open market economy and attracts lots of foreign investment  does not protect civil liberties such as freedom of speech and expression  the private  capitalist  sector in the people s republic of china has grown exponentially and thrived since its inception  despite having an authoritarian government  augusto pinochet s rule in chile led to economic growth and high levels of inequality   by using authoritarian means to create a safe environment for investment and capitalism  in capital in the twenty first century  thomas piketty of the paris school of economics asserts that inequality is the inevitable consequence of economic growth in a capitalist economy and the resulting concentration of wealth can destabilize democratic societies and undermine the ideals of social justice upon which they are built       capital has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries    in the form of merchant  renting and lending activities  and occasionally also as small scale industry with some wage labour  marx was also well aware that wage labour existed for centuries on a modest scale before the advent of capitalist industry   simple commodity exchange  and consequently simple commodity production  which form the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade  have a very long history  the  capitalistic era  according to marx dates from the   th century  i e  it began with merchant capitalism and relatively small urban workshops    early islam promulgated capitalist economic policies  which migrated to europe through trade partners from cities such as venice    for the capitalist mode of production to emerge as a distinctive mode of production dominating the whole production process of society  many different social  economic  cultural  technical and legal political conditions had to come together     for most of human history  these did not come together  capital existed  commercial trade existed  but it did not lead to industrialisation and large scale capitalist industry  that required a whole series of new conditions  namely specific technologies of mass production  the ability to independently and privately own and trade in means of production  a class of workers compelled to sell their labour power for a living  a legal framework promoting commerce  a physical infrastructure making the circulation of goods on a large scale possible  security for private accumulation  and so on  in many third world countries  many of these conditions do not exist even today  even although there is plenty capital and labour available  the obstacles for the development of capitalist markets are less a technical matter and more a social  cultural and political problem     capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the renaissance       the economic foundations of the feudal agricultural system began to shift substantially in   th century england  the manorial system had broken down by this time  and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates  instead of a serf based system of labor  workers were increasingly being employed as part of a broader and expanding money economy  the system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase the productivity of the agriculture to make profit  the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try out better methods  and the tenants also had incentive to improve their methods  in order to flourish in an increasingly competitive labor market  terms of rent for the land were becoming subject to economic market forces rather than the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation        by the early   th century  england was a centralized state  in which much of the feudal order of medieval europe had been swept away  this centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city  london  the capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country  creating a very large internal market for goods  instead of the fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed in most parts of the continent     the economic doctrine that held sway between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is commonly described as mercantilism      this period  the age of discovery  was associated with the geographic exploration of foreign lands by merchant traders  especially from england and the low countries  mercantilism was a system of trade for profit  although commodities were still largely produced by non capitalist production methods   most scholars consider the era of merchant capitalism and mercantilism as the origin of modern capitalism      although karl polanyi argued that the hallmark of capitalism is the establishment of generalized markets for what he referred to as the  fictitious commodities   land  labor  and money  accordingly  he argued that  not until      was a competitive labor market established in england  hence industrial capitalism as a social system cannot be said to have existed before that date        england began a large scale and integrative approach to mercantilism during the elizabethan era              a systematic and coherent explanation of balance of trade was made public through thomas mun s argument england s treasure by forraign trade  or the balance of our forraign trade is the rule of our treasure  it was written in the     s and published in            european merchants  backed by state controls  subsidies  and monopolies  made most of their profits from the buying and selling of goods  in the words of francis bacon  the purpose of mercantilism was  the opening and well balancing of trade  the cherishing of manufacturers  the banishing of idleness  the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws  the improvement and husbanding of the soil  the regulation of pricesxa           the british east india company and the dutch east india company inaugurated an expansive era of commerce and trade      these companies were characterized by their colonial and expansionary powers given to them by nation states    during this era  merchants  who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism  invested capital in the east india companies and other colonies  seeking a return on investment     a new group of economic theorists  led by david hume   and adam smith  in the mid   th century  challenged fundamental mercantilist doctrines such as the belief that the amount of the world s wealth remained constant and that a state could only increase its wealth at the expense of another state     during the industrial revolution  the industrialist replaced the merchant as a dominant factor in the capitalist system and affected the decline of the traditional handicraft skills of artisans  guilds  and journeymen  also during this period  the surplus generated by the rise of commercial agriculture encouraged increased mechanization of agriculture  industrial capitalism marked the development of the factory system of manufacturing  characterized by a complex division of labor between and within work process and the routine of work tasks  and finally established the global domination of the capitalist mode of production       britain also abandoned its protectionist policy  as embraced by mercantilism  in the   th century  richard cobden and john bright  who based their beliefs on the manchester school  initiated a movement to lower tariffs    in the     s  britain adopted a less protectionist policy  with the repeal of the corn laws and the navigation acts    britain reduced tariffs and quotas  in line with david ricardo s advocacy for free trade     capitalism was carried across the world by broader processes of globalization such as imperialism and  by the end of the nineteenth century  became the dominant global economic system  in turn intensifying processes of economic and other globalization    later  in the   th century  capitalism overcame a challenge by centrally planned economies and is now the encompassing system worldwide      with the mixed economy being its dominant form in the industrialized western world     industrialization allowed cheap production of household items using economies of scale  while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities  globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth century imperialism       after the first and second opium wars and the completion of british conquest of india  vast populations of these regions became ready consumers of european exports  it was in this period that areas of sub saharan africa and the pacific islands were incorporated into the world system  meanwhile  the conquest of new parts of the globe  notably sub saharan africa  by europeans yielded valuable natural resources such as rubber  diamonds and coal and helped fuel trade and investment between the european imperial powers  their colonies  and the united states     the inhabitant of london could order by telephone  sipping his morning tea  the various products of the whole earth  and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep  militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper  what an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man was that age which came to an end in august            the global financial system was mainly tied to the gold standard in this period  the united kingdom first formally adopted this standard in       soon to follow was canada in       newfoundland in       and the united states and germany  de jure  in       new technologies  such as the telegraph  the transatlantic cable  the radiotelephone  the steamship and railway allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree       in the period following the global depression of the     s  the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world  the postwar boom ended in the late     s and early     s  and the situation was worsened by the rise of stagflation    monetarism  a modification of keynesianism that is more compatible with laissez faire  gained increasing prominence in the capitalist world  especially under the leadership of ronald reagan in the us and margaret thatcher in the uk in the     s  public and political interest began shifting away from the so called collectivist concerns of keynes s managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice  called  remarketized capitalism        capitalist society is characterised by the controversial circuit of commodity production  m c m  and by renting money for that purpose where the aggregate of market actors determine the money price m  of the input labour and commodities and m  the struck price of c  the produced market commodity  it is centred on the process m   m    making money  and the exchange of value that occurs at that point  m    m is the condition of rationality in the capitalist system and a necessary condition for the next cycle of accumulation production    for this reason  capitalism is  production for exchange  driven by the desire for personal accumulation of money receipts in such exchanges  mediated by free markets  the markets themselves are driven by the needs and wants of consumers and those of society as a whole in the form of the bourgeois state  these wants and needs would  in the socialist or communist society envisioned by marx  engels and others  be the driving force  it would be  production for use   contemporary mainstream economics  particularly that associated with the right  holds that an  invisible hand     through little more than the freedom of the market  is able to match social production to these needs and desires       in general  capitalism as an economic system and mode of production can be summarised by the following       in free market and laissez faire forms of capitalism  markets are used most extensively with minimal or no regulation over the pricing mechanism  in mixed economies  which are almost universal today    markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct market failures  promote social welfare  conserve natural resources  fund defense and public safety or for other reasons  in state capitalist systems  markets are relied upon the least  with the state relying heavily on state owned enterprises or indirect economic planning to accumulate capital     supply is the amount of a good or service produced by a firm and which is available for sale  demand is the amount that people are willing to buy at a specific price  prices tend to rise when demand exceeds supply  and fall when supply exceeds demand  in theory  the market is able to coordinate itself when a new equilibrium price and quantity is reached     competition arises when more than one producer is trying to sell the same or similar products to the same buyers  in capitalist theory  competition leads to innovation and more affordable prices  without competition  a monopoly or cartel may develop  a monopoly occurs when a firm supplies the total output in the market  the firm can therefore limit output and raise prices because it has no fear of competition  a cartel is a group of firms that act together in a monopolistic manner to control output and raise prices     the profit motive is a theory in capitalism which posits that the ultimate goal of a business is to make money  stated differently  the reason for a business s existence is to turn a profit  the profit motive functions on the rational choice theory  or the theory that individuals tend to pursue what is in their own best interests  accordingly  businesses seek to benefit themselves and or their shareholders by maximising profits     in capitalist theoretics  the profit motive is said to ensure that resources are being allocated efficiently  for instance  austrian economist henry hazlitt explains   if there is no profit in making an article  it is a sign that the labor and capital devoted to its production are misdirected  the value of the resources that must be used up in making the article is greater than the value of the article itself     in other words  profits let companies know whether an item is worth producing  theoretically in free and competitive markets  maximising profits ensures that resources are not wasted     the relationship between the state  its formal mechanisms  and capitalist societies has been debated in many fields of social and political theory  with active discussion since the   th century  hernando de soto is a contemporary economist who has argued that an important characteristic of capitalism is the functioning state protection of property rights in a formal property system where ownership and transactions are clearly recorded       according to de soto  this is the process by which physical assets are transformed into capital  which in turn may be used in many more ways and much more efficiently in the market economy  a number of marxian economists have argued that the enclosure acts in england  and similar legislation elsewhere  were an integral part of capitalist primitive accumulation and that specific legal frameworks of private land ownership have been integral to the development of capitalism         in capitalist economics  market competition is the rivalry among sellers trying to achieve such goals as increasing profits  market share  and sales volume by varying the elements of the marketing mix  price  product  distribution  and promotion  merriam webster defines competition in business as  the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favourable terms     it was described by adam smith in the wealth of nations        and later economists as allocating productive resources to their most highly valued uses   and encouraging efficiency  smith and other classical economists before cournot were referring to price and non price rivalry among producers to sell their goods on best terms by bidding of buyers  not necessarily to a large number of sellers nor to a market in final equilibrium    competition is widespread throughout the market process  it is a condition where  buyers tend to compete with other buyers  and sellers tend to compete with other sellers     in offering goods for exchange  buyers competitively bid to purchase specific quantities of specific goods which are available  or might be available if sellers were to choose to offer such goods  similarly  sellers bid against other sellers in offering goods on the market  competing for the attention and exchange resources of buyers  competition results from scarcity there is never enough to satisfy all conceivable human wants and occurs  when people strive to meet the criteria that are being used to determine who gets what        in a capitalist economy  the reserve army of labour refers to the unemployed and under employed    it is synonymous with  industrial reserve army  or  relative surplus population   except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work  the use of the word  army  refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a hierarchy  under the command or authority of the owners of capital     prior to the start of the capitalist era in human history  i e  before the     s   structural unemployment on a mass scale rarely existed  other than that caused by natural disasters and wars    in ancient societies  all people who could work necessarily had to work  otherwise they would starve  a slave or a serf by definition could not become  unemployed   there was normally very little possibility of  earning a crust  without working at all  and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh    children began to work already at a very early age  indeed  the word  employment  is linguistically a product of the capitalist era  a permanent level of unemployment presupposes a working population which is to a large extent dependent on a wage or salary for a living  without having other means of livelihood  as well as the right of enterprises to hire and fire employees in accordance with commercial or economic conditions  the expression  unemployed  in english  in the sense of  temporarily out of work   dates back to the     s  reference to  the unemployed  as a group was first made in       and reference to  unemployment  as a general condition is first attested in            the first recorded discussion of the reserve army of labour is in a manuscript written by karl marx      big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of overproduction  the main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is  of course  to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible  which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it  i e   when the overpopulation is the greatest  overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie  and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out  since capital only increases when it employs workers  the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat  and  as we have seen  according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour  the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster  the    theory    which is also expressed as a law of nature  that population grows faster than the means of subsistence  is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience  makes hard heartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature  and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as other natural event without bestirring himself  and  on the other hand  to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it  to be sure  the proletarian can restrain his natural instinct by reason  and so  by moral supervision  halt the law of nature in its injurious course of development     karl marx  wages  december           marx introducedcitation needed the concept in chapter    of the first volume of das kapital    which states      capitalistic accumulation itself    constantly produces  and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent  a relatively redundant population of workers  i e   a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the valorisation of capital  and therefore a surplus population    it is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller  rather than a greater number of labourers  if the cost is about the same    the more extended the scale of production  the stronger this motive  its force increases with the accumulation of capital      his argument is that as capitalism develops  the organic composition of capital will increase  which means that the mass of constant capital grows faster than the mass of variable capital  fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society s requirements  in addition  capital will become more concentrated and centralised in fewer hands  this being the absolute historical tendency  part of the working population will tend to become surplus to the requirements of capital accumulation over time  paradoxically  the larger the wealth of society  the larger the industrial reserve army will become  marx called it  the antagonism of capital accumulation  and he cites his the poverty of philosophy   chapter    section    to explain this phenomenon in relation with relations of production    one could add that the larger the wealth of society  the more people it can support who do not work  however  as marx develops the argument further  it also becomes clear that  depending on the state of the economy  the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract  alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce  thus      taking them as a whole  the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army  and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle  they are  therefore  not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population  but by the varying proportions in which the working class is divided into active and reserve army  by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus population  by the extent to which it is now absorbed  now set free      in recent years  there has been growing research on the concept of  the precariat   to describe a growing reliance on temporary  part time workers with precarious status  who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor    precarious workers do work part time or full time in temporary jobs  but they cannot really earn enough to live on  and depend partly on friends or family  or on state benefits  to survive  typically they do not become truly  unemployed   but they don t have a decent job to go to either       although non employed people who are unable or uninterested in performing legal paid work are not considered among the  unemployed   the concept of  conjunctural unemployment  is used in economics nowadays    economists often distinguish between short term  frictional  or  cyclical  unemployment  and longer term  structural unemployment   sometimes there is a shortterm mismatch between the demand and supply of labour  at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a long time  if there is no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future  many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work     marx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in capital  ch      section iv  the army of labor consists in those working class people employed in average or better than average jobs  not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs  there are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves  the  stagnant pool   the floating reserves  the latent reserve  and pauperdom  finally  people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality  and marx refers to such people as  lumpenproletariat        the modern unemployed would refer primarily to the floating reserve  people who used to have good jobs  but are now out of work  they certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary   conjunctural unemployment    but they are well  aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class     the capitalist mode of production refers to the systems of organising production and distribution within capitalist societies  private money making in various forms  renting  banking  merchant trade  production for profit  etc   preceded the development of the capitalist mode of production as such  the capitalist mode of production proper  based on wage labour and private ownership of the means of production  and on industrial technology  began to grow rapidly in western europe from the industrial revolution  later extending to most of the world       the term capitalist mode of production is defined by private ownership of the means of production  extraction of surplus value by the owning class for the purpose of capital accumulation  wage based labour  and  at least as far as commodities are concerned  being market based        capitalism  in the form of money making activity has existed in the shape of merchants and money lenders who acted as intermediaries between consumers and producers engaging in simple commodity production  hence the reference to  merchant capitalism   since the beginnings of civilisation  what is specific about the  capitalist mode of production  is that most of the inputs and outputs of production are supplied through the market  i e  they are commodities  and essentially all production is in this mode   for example  in flourishing feudalism  most or all of the factors of production including labour are owned by the feudal ruling class outright and the products may also be consumed without a market of any kind  it is production for use within the feudal social unit and for limited trade    this has the important consequence that the whole organisation of the production process is reshaped and re organised to conform with economic rationality as bounded by capitalism  which is expressed in price relationships between inputs and outputs  wages  non labour factor costs  sales  profits  rather than the larger rational context faced by society overall  that is  the whole process is organised and re shaped in order to conform to  commercial logic   essentially  capital accumulation comes to define economic rationality in capitalist production       a society  region or nation is  capitalist  if the predominant source of incomes and products being distributed is capitalist activity  even so  this does not yet mean necessarily that the capitalist mode of production is dominant in that society     a  mode of production   in german  produktionsweise  means simply  the distinctive way of producing   which could be defined in terms of how it is socially organised and what kinds of technologies and tools are used      under the capitalist mode of production     the capitalist mode of production may exist within societies with differing political systems  e g  liberal democracy  social democracy  fascism  communist state  czarism   and alongside different social structures such as tribalism  the caste system  an agrarian based peasant society  urban industrial society and post industrialism  although capitalism has existed in the form of merchant activity  banking  renting land  and small scale manufactures in previous stages of history  it was usually a relatively minor activity and secondary to the dominant forms of social organisation and production with the prevailing property system keeping commerce within clear limits       there are varying definitions on what constitutes a capitalist mode of production  in a sense  das kapital provides a  definition   which it is possible to summarise the essential defining characteristics of the capitalist mode of production as follows     wage labour refers to the class structure of capitalism  whereby workers receive either a wage or a salary  and owners receive the profits generated by the factors of production employed in the production of economic value  individuals who possess and supply financial capital to productive ventures become owners  either jointly  as shareholders  or individually  in marxian economics these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists  the description of the role of the capitalist has shifted  first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers  and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production    labor includes all physical and mental human resources  including entrepreneurial capacity and management skills  which are needed to produce products and services  production is the act of making goods or services by applying labor power         under the system of wage labour  the workers sell their labour power under a formal or informal employment contract to a member of the capitalist class      these transactions usually occur in a labour market where wages are market determined    in exchange for the wages paid  the work product generally becomes the undifferentiated property of the employer  except for special cases such as the vesting of intellectual property patents in the united states where patent rights are usually vested in the employee personally responsible for the invention  a wage labourer is a person whose primary means of income is from the selling of his or her labour in this way     critics of the capitalist mode of production see wage labour as a major  if not defining  aspect of hierarchical industrial systems  most opponents of the institution support worker self management and economic democracy as alternatives to both wage labour and to capitalism  while most opponents of wage labour blame the capitalist owners of the means of production for its existence  most anarchists and other libertarian socialists also hold the state as equally responsible as it exists as a tool utilised by capitalists to subsidise themselves and protect the institution of private ownership of the means of production which guarantees the concentration of capital among a wealthy elite leaving the majority of the population without access  as some opponents of wage labour take influence from marxist propositions  many are opposed to private property  but maintain respect for personal property     a point of criticism is that after people have been compelled by economic necessity to no feasible alternative than that of wage labour  exploitation occurs  thus the claim that wage labour is  voluntary  on the part of the labourer is considered a red herring as the relationship is only entered into due to systemic coercion brought about by the inequality of bargaining power between labour and capital as classes     the most common form of wage labour currently is ordinary direct  or  full time   employment in which a free worker sells his or her labour for an indeterminate time  from a few years to the entire career of the worker   in return for a money wage or salary and a continuing relationship with the employer which it does not in general offer contractors or other irregular staff  however  wage labour takes many other forms  and explicit as opposed to implicit  i e  conditioned by local labour and tax law  contracts are not uncommon  economic history shows a great variety of ways in which labour is traded and exchanged  the differences show up in the form of     wage labour has long been compared to slavery          as a result  the term  wage slavery  is often utilised as a pejorative for wage labour    similarly  advocates of slavery looked upon the  comparative evils of slave society and of free society  of slavery to human masters and slavery to capital     and proceeded to argue persuasively that wage slavery was actually worse than chattel slavery     slavery apologists like george fitzhugh contended that workers only accepted wage labour with the passage of time  as they became  familiarised and inattentive to the infected social atmosphere they continually inhale        similarities between wage labour and slavery were noted as early as cicero in ancient rome     with the advent of the industrial revolution  thinkers such as proudhon and marx elaborated the comparison between wage labour and slavery in the context of a critique of societal property not intended for active personal use        while luddites emphasised the dehumanisation brought about by machines  before the american civil war  southern defenders of african american slavery invoked the concept of wage slavery to favorably compare the condition of their slaves to workers in the north        the united states abolished slavery during the civil war  but labor union activists found the metaphor useful  according to lawrence glickman  in the gilded age   references abounded in the labor press  and it is hard to find a speech by a labour leader without the phrase         the slave  together with his labour power  was sold to his owner once for all     the wage labourer  on the other hand  sells his very self  and that by fractions     he belongs to the capitalist class  and it is for him     to find a buyer in this capitalist class        according to noam chomsky  analysis of the psychological implications of wage slavery goes back to the enlightenment era  in his      book on the limits of state action  classical liberal thinker wilhelm von humboldt explained how  whatever does not spring from a man s free choice  or is only the result of instruction and guidance  does not enter into his very nature  he does not perform it with truly human energies  but merely with mechanical exactness  and so when the labourer works under external control   we may admire what he does  but we despise what he is      both the milgram and stanford experiments have been found useful in the psychological study of wage based workplace relations     additionally  as per anthropologist david graeber  the earliest wage labour contracts we know about were in fact contracts for the rental of chattel slaves  usually the owner would receive a share of the money  and the slave  another  with which to maintain his or her living expenses   such arrangements  according to graeber  were quite common in new world slavery as well  whether in the united states or brazil     c  l  r  james argued in the black jacobins that most of the techniques of human organisation employed on factory workers during the industrial revolution were first developed on slave plantations        some anti capitalist thinkers claim that the elite maintain wage slavery and a divided working class through their influence over the media and entertainment industry        educational institutions  unjust laws  nationalist and corporate propaganda  pressures and incentives to internalise values serviceable to the power structure  state violence  fear of unemployment    and a historical legacy of exploitation and profit accumulation transfer under prior systems  which shaped the development of economic theory     adam smith noted that employers often conspire together to keep wages low        the interest of the dealers    in any particular branch of trade or manufactures  is always in some respects different from  and even opposite to  that of the public  they have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public  we rarely hear  it has been said  of the combinations of masters  though frequently of those of workmen  but whoever imagines  upon this account  that masters rarely combine  is as ignorant of the world as of the subject  masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit  but constant and uniform combination  not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate  it is not  however  difficult to foresee which of the two parties must  upon all ordinary occasions  have the advantage in the dispute  and force the other into a compliance with their terms     aristotle made the statement     the citizens must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life  for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue   nor yet must those who are to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil  for leisure is needed both for the development of virtue and for active participation in politics       often paraphrased as  all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind      cicero wrote in    bc that   vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere manual labour  not for artistic skill  for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery      somewhat similar criticisms have also been expressed by some proponents of liberalism  like henry george        silvio gesell and thomas paine     as well as the distributist school of thought within the roman catholic church     to marxian and anarchist thinkers like bakunin and kropotkin  wage slavery was a class condition in place due to the existence of private property and the state  this class situation rested primarily on     for marxists  labour as commodity  which is how they regard wage labour     provides a fundamental point of attack against capitalism      it can be persuasively argued   noted one concerned philosopher   that the conception of the worker s labour as a commodity confirms marx s stigmatization of the wage system of private capitalism as  wage slavery   that is  as an instrument of the capitalist s for reducing the worker s condition to that of a slave  if not below it      that this objection is fundamental follows immediately from marx s conclusion that wage labour is the very foundation of capitalism   without a class dependent on wages  the moment individuals confront each other as free persons  there can be no production of surplus value  without the production of surplus value there can be no capitalist production  and hence no capital and no capitalist         market failure occurs when an externality is present and a market will either under produce a product with a positive externalisation or overproduce a product that generates a negative externalisation  air pollution  for instance  is a negative externalisation that cannot be incorporated into markets as the world s air is not owned and then sold for use to polluters  so  too much pollution could be emitted and people not involved in the production pay the cost of the pollution instead of the firm that initially emitted the air pollution  critics of market failure theory  like ronald coase  harold demsetz  and james m  buchanan argue that government programs and policies also fall short of absolute perfection  market failures are often small  and government failures are sometimes large  it is therefore the case that imperfect markets are often better than imperfect governmental alternatives  while all nations currently have some kind of market regulations  the desirable degree of regulation is disputed     the doctrine of free competition is essential to the functioning of a capitalist economy  and as such  anti competitive behaviour in the market poses a crucial weakness in capitalist economics  issues such as monopolistic behaviour on the part of corporations  and aspects of intellectual property laws pose problems to capitalist economies     from the end of the   th century onwards  capitalist societies began to experience a transition from free competition to monopolistic takes on the capitalist economic system     characterised by the advent of large firms taking control of specific industries     a prime example in the united states at the time was standard oil     the accumulation of capital refers to the process of  making money   or growing an initial sum of money through investment in production  capitalism is based around the accumulation of capital  whereby financial capital is invested in order to make a profit and then reinvested into further production in a continuous process of accumulation  in marxian economic theory  this dynamic is called the law of value  capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism  where economic activity is structured around the accumulation of capital  defined as investment in order to realize a financial profit     in this context   capital  is defined as money or a financial asset invested for the purpose of making more money  whether in the form of profit  rent  interest  royalties  capital gain or some other kind of return         in economics  accounting and marxian economics  capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings  especially in real capital goods  the concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation  in modern macroeconomics and econometrics the term capital formation is often used in preference to  accumulation   though the united nations conference on trade and development  unctad  refers nowadays to  accumulation   the term is occasionally used in national accounts     accumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments  the amount of income that is reinvested  or as the change in the value of assets owned  the increase in the value of the capital stock   using company balance sheets  tax data and direct surveys as a basis  government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of national accounts  national balance of payments and flow of funds statistics  usually the reserve banks and the treasury provide interpretations and analysis of this data  standard indicators include capital formation  gross fixed capital formation  fixed capital  household asset wealth  and foreign direct investment     organisations such as the international monetary fund  unctad  the world bank group  the oecd  and the bank for international settlements used national investment data to estimate world trends  the bureau of economic analysis  eurostat and the japan statistical office provide data on the usa  europe and japan respectively  other useful sources of investment information are business magazines such as fortune  forbes  the economist  business week  etc   and various corporate  watchdog  organisations and non governmental organisation publications  a reputable scientific journal is the review of income   wealth  in the case of the usa  the  analytical perspectives  document  an annex to the yearly budget  provides useful wealth and capital estimates applying to the whole country     in karl marx s economic theory  capital accumulation refers to the operation whereby profits are reinvested increasing the total quantity of capital  capital is viewed by marx as expanding value  that is  in other terms  as a sum of capital  usually expressed in money  that is transformed through human labor into a larger value  extracted as profits and expressed as money  here  capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset value in search of additional value or surplus value  this requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned  and trading rights to be established  capital accumulation has a double origin  namely in trade and in expropriation  both of a legal or illegal kind  the reason is that a stock of capital can be increased through a process of exchange or  trading up  but also through directly taking an asset or resource from someone else  without compensation  david harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession     the continuation and progress of capital accumulation depends on the removal of obstacles to the expansion of trade  and this has historically often been a violent process  as markets expand  more and more new opportunities develop for accumulating capital  because more and more types of goods and services can be traded in  but capital accumulation may also confront resistance  when people refuse to sell  or refuse to buy  for example a strike by investors or workers  or consumer resistance   what spurs accumulation is competition  in business  if you don t go forward  you go backward  and unless the law prevents it  the strong will exploit the weak  the basis of capital accumulation is essentially is capitalising on the labour effort of others  when the  economic cake  expands  this may be obscured because all can gain from trade  but when the  economic cake  shrinks  then capital accumulation can only occur by taking income or assets from other people  other social classes  or other nations  the point is that to exist  capital must always grow  and to ensure that it will grow  people are prepared to do almost anything     according to marx  capital has the tendency for concentration and centralisation in the hands of the wealthy  marx explains      it is concentration of capitals already formed  destruction of their individual independence  expropriation of capitalist by capitalist  transformation of many small into few large capitals     capital grows in one place to a huge mass in a single hand  because it has in another place been lost by many     the battle of competition is fought by cheapening of commodities  the cheapness of commodities demands  caeteris paribus  on the productiveness of labour  and this again on the scale of production  therefore  the larger capitals beat the smaller  it will further be remembered that  with the development of the capitalist mode of production  there is an increase in the minimum amount of individual capital necessary to carry on a business under its normal conditions  the smaller capitals  therefore  crowd into spheres of production which modern industry has only sporadically or incompletely got hold of  here competition rages     it always ends in the ruin of many small capitalists  whose capitals partly pass into the hands of their conquerors  partly vanish         in marxian economics  the rate of accumulation is defined as     the value of the real net increase in the stock of capital in an accounting period      the proportion of realised surplus value or profit income which is reinvested  rather than consumed  this rate can be expressed by means of various ratios between the original capital outlay  the realised turnover  surplus value or profit and reinvestments  see  e g   the writings of the economist micha  kalecki      other things being equal  the greater the amount of profit income that is disbursed as personal earnings and used for consumptive purposes  the lower the savings rate and the lower the rate of accumulation is likely to be  however  earnings spent on consumption can also stimulate market demand and higher investment  this is the cause of endless controversies in economic theory about  how much to spend  and how much to save      in a boom period of capitalism  the growth of investments is cumulative  i e  one investment leads to another  leading to a constantly expanding market  an expanding labor force  and an increase in the standard of living for the majority of the people     in a stagnating  decadent capitalism  the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces  real estate  financial speculation  and luxury consumption  in that case  income from value adding production will decline in favour of interest  rent and tax income  with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment     as a rule  the larger the total sum of capital invested  the higher the return on investment will be  the more capital one owns  the more capital one can also borrow and reinvest at a higher rate of profit or interest  the inverse is also true  and this is one factor in the widening gap between the rich and the poor     ernest mandel emphasised that the rhythm of capital accumulation and growth depended critically on     the division of a society s social product between  necessary product  and  surplus product   and     the division of the surplus product between investment and consumption  in turn  this allocation pattern reflected the outcome of competition among capitalists  competition between capitalists and workers  and competition between workers  the pattern of capital accumulation can therefore never be simply explained by commercial factors  it also involved social factors and power relationships     strictly speaking  capital has accumulated only when realised profit income has been reinvested in capital assets  but the process of capital accumulation in production has  as suggested in the first volume of marx s das kapital  at least   distinct but linked moments     all of these moments do not refer simply to an  economic  or commercial process  rather  they assume the existence of legal  social  cultural and economic power conditions  without which creation  distribution and circulation of the new wealth could not occur  this becomes especially clear when the attempt is made to create a market where none exists  or where people refuse to trade     in volume   of das kapital  marx continues the story and shows that  with the aid of bank credit  capital in search of growth can more or less smoothly mutate from one form to another  alternately taking the form of money capital  liquid deposits  securities  etc    commodity capital  tradable products  real estate etc    or production capital  means of production and labor power      his discussion of the simple and expanded reproduction of the conditions of production offers a more sophisticated model of the parameters of the accumulation process as a whole  at simple reproduction  a sufficient amount is produced to sustain society at the given living standard  the stock of capital stays constant  at expanded reproduction  more product value is produced than is necessary to sustain society at a given living standard  a surplus product  the additional product value is available for investments which enlarge the scale and variety of production     the bourgeois claim there is no economic law according to which capital is necessarily re invested in the expansion of production  that such depends on anticipated profitability  market expectations and perceptions of investment risk  such statements only explain the subjective experiences of investors and ignore the objective realities which would influence such opinions  as marx states in vol    simple reproduction only exists if the variable and surplus capital realised by dept    producers of means of production exactly equals that of the constant capital of dept     producers of articles of consumption  pg       such equilibrium rests on various assumptions  such as a constant labor supply  no population growth   accumulation does not imply a necessary change in total magnitude of value produced but can simply refer to a change in the composition of an industry  pg           ernest mandel introduced the additional concept of contracted economic reproduction  i e  reduced accumulation where business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business  or economic reproduction on a decreasing scale  for example due to wars  natural disasters or devalorisation     balanced economic growth requires that different factors in the accumulation process expand in appropriate proportions  but markets themselves cannot spontaneously create that balance  in fact what drives business activity is precisely the imbalances between supply and demand  inequality is the motor of growth  this partly explains why the worldwide pattern of economic growth is very uneven and unequal  even although markets have existed almost everywhere for a very long time  some people argue that it also explains government regulation of market trade and protectionism      accumulation of capital  sometimes also refers in marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist social relations  institutions  on a larger scale over time  i e   the expansion of the size of the proletariat and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie     this interpretation emphasises that capital ownership  predicated on command over labor  is a social relation  the growth of capital implies the growth of the working class  a  law of accumulation    in the first volume of das kapital marx had illustrated this idea with reference to edward gibbon wakefield s theory of colonisation         wakefield discovered that in the colonies  property in money  means of subsistence  machines  and other means of production  does not as yet stamp a man as a capitalist if there be wanting the correlative   the wage worker  the other man who is compelled to sell himself of his own free will  he discovered that capital is not a thing  but a social relation between persons  established by the instrumentality of things  mr  peel  he moans  took with him from england to swan river  west australia  means of subsistence and of production to the amount of          mr  peel had the foresight to bring with him  besides        persons of the working class  men  women  and children  once arrived at his destination   mr  peel was left without a servant to make his bed or fetch him water from the river   unhappy mr  peel  who provided for everything except the export of english modes of production to swan river        das kapital  vol     ch        in the third volume of das kapital  marx refers to the  fetishism of capital  reaching its highest point with interest bearing capital  because now capital seems to grow of its own accord without anybody doing anything  in this case      the relations of capital assume their most externalised and most fetish like form in interest bearing capital  we have here   money creating more money  self expanding value  without the process that effectuates these two extremes  in merchant s capital    there is at least the general form of the capitalistic movement  although it confines itself solely to the sphere of circulation  so that profit appears merely as profit derived from alienation  but it is at least seen to be the product of a social relation  not the product of a mere thing        this is obliterated in   the form of interest bearing capital        the thing  money  commodity  value  is now capital even as a mere thing  and capital appears as a mere thing  the result of the entire process of reproduction appears as a property inherent in the thing itself  it depends on the owner of the money  i e   of the commodity in its continually exchangeable form  whether he wants to spend it as money or loan it out as capital  in interest bearing capital  therefore  this automatic fetish  self expanding value  money generating money  are brought out in their pure state and in this form it no longer bears the birth marks of its origin  the social relation is consummated in the relation of a thing  of money  to itself  instead of the actual transformation of money into capital  we see here only form without content         das kapital   vol    ch        in capitalist economic structures  supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market  it concludes that in a competitive market  the unit price for a particular good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded by consumers  at current price  will equal the quantity supplied by producers  at current price   resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity     the four basic laws of supply and demand are           although it is normal to regard the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as functions of the price of the goods  the standard graphical representation  usually attributed to alfred marshall  has price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis  the opposite of the standard convention for the representation of a mathematical function     since determinants of supply and demand other than the price of the goods in question are not explicitly represented in the supply demand diagram  changes in the values of these variables are represented by moving the supply and demand curves  often described as  shifts  in the curves   by contrast  responses to changes in the price of the good are represented as movements along unchanged supply and demand curves     a supply schedule is a table that shows the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied  under the assumption of perfect competition  supply is determined by marginal cost  that is  firms will produce additional output while the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they would receive     a hike in the cost of raw goods would decrease supply  shifting costs up  while a discount would increase supply  shifting costs down and hurting producers as producer surplus decreases     by its very nature  conceptualising a supply curve requires the firm to be a perfect competitor  i e  to have no influence over the market price   this is true because each point on the supply curve is the answer to the question  if this firm is faced with this potential price  how much output will it be able to and willing to sell   if a firm has market power  its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price  therefor the firm is not  faced with  any price  and the question becomes less relevant     economists distinguish between the supply curve of an individual firm and between the market supply curve  the market supply curve is obtained by summing the quantities supplied by all suppliers at each potential price  thus  in the graph of the supply curve  individual firms  supply curves are added horizontally to obtain the market supply curve     economists also distinguish the short run market supply curve from the long run market supply curve  in this context  two things are assumed constant by definition of the short run  the availability of one or more fixed inputs  typically physical capital   and the number of firms in the industry  in the long run  firms have a chance to adjust their holdings of physical capital  enabling them to better adjust their quantity supplied at any given price  furthermore  in the long run potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions  for both of these reasons  long run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short run counterparts     the determinants of supply are     a demand schedule  depicted graphically as the demand curve  represents the amount of some goods that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices  assuming all determinants of demand other than the price of the good in question  such as income  tastes and preferences  the price of substitute goods  and the price of complementary goods  remain the same  following the law of demand  the demand curve is almost always represented as downward sloping  meaning that as price decreases  consumers will buy more of the good        just like the supply curves reflect marginal cost curves  demand curves are determined by marginal utility curves     consumers will be willing to buy a given quantity of a good  at a given price  if the marginal utility of additional consumption is equal to the opportunity cost determined by the price  that is  the marginal utility of alternative consumption choices  the demand schedule is defined as the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a given product in a given frame of time     it is aforementioned  that the demand curve is generally downward sloping  there may be rare examples of goods that have upward sloping demand curves  two different hypothetical types of goods with upward sloping demand curves are giffen goods  an inferior but staple good  and veblen goods  goods made more fashionable by a higher price      by its very nature  conceptualising a demand curve requires that the purchaser be a perfect competitor that is  that the purchaser has no influence over the market price  this is true because each point on the demand curve is the answer to the question  if this buyer is faced with this potential price  how much of the product will it purchase   if a buyer has market power  so its decision of how much to buy influences the market price  then the buyer is not  faced with  any price  and the question is meaningless     like with supply curves  economists distinguish between the demand curve of an individual and the market demand curve  the market demand curve is obtained by summing the quantities demanded by all consumers at each potential price  thus  in the graph of the demand curve  individuals  demand curves are added horizontally to obtain the market demand curve     the determinants of demand are     in the context of supply and demand  economic equilibrium refers to a state where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the  equilibrium  values of economic variables will not change  for example  in the standard text book model of perfect competition  equilibrium occurs at the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal     market equilibrium in this case refers to a condition where a market price is established through competition such that the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount of goods or services produced by sellers  this price is often called the competitive price or market clearing price and will tend not to change unless demand or supply changes and the quantity is called  competitive quantity  or market clearing quantity     partial equilibrium  as the name suggests  takes into consideration only a part of the market to attain equilibrium     jain proposes  attributed to george stigler    a partial equilibrium is one which is based on only a restricted range of data  a standard example is price of a single product  the prices of all other products being held fixed during the analysis         the supply and demand model is a partial equilibrium model of economic equilibrium  where the clearance on the market of some specific goods is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets  in other words  the prices of all substitutes and complements  as well as income levels of consumers are constant  this makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy     here the dynamic process is that prices adjust until supply equals demand  it is a powerfully simple technique that allows one to study equilibrium  efficiency and comparative statics  the stringency of the simplifying assumptions inherent in this approach make the model considerably more tractable  but may produce results which  while seemingly precise  do not effectively model real world economic phenomena     partial equilibrium analysis examines the effects of policy action in creating equilibrium only in that particular sector or market which is directly affected  ignoring its effect in any other market or industry assuming that they being small will have little impact if any     hence this analysis is considered to be useful in constricted markets     l on walras first formalised the idea of a one period economic equilibrium of the general economic system  but it was french economist antoine augustin cournot and english political economist alfred marshall who developed tractable models to analyse an economic system     demand and supply relations in a market can be statistically estimated from price  quantity  and other data with sufficient information in the model  this can be done with simultaneous equation methods of estimation in econometrics  such methods allow solving for the model relevant  structural coefficients   the estimated algebraic counterparts of the theory  the parameter identification problem is a common issue in  structural estimation   typically  data on exogenous variables  that is  variables other than price and quantity  both of which are endogenous variables  are needed to perform such an estimation  an alternative to  structural estimation  is reduced form estimation  which regresses each of the endogenous variables on the respective exogenous variables     demand and supply have also been generalised to explain macroeconomic variables in a market economy  including the quantity of total output and the general price level  the aggregate demand aggregate supply model may be the most direct application of supply and demand to macroeconomics  but other macroeconomic models also use supply and demand  compared to microeconomic uses of demand and supply  different  and more controversial  theoretical considerations apply to such macroeconomic counterparts as aggregate demand and aggregate supply  demand and supply are also used in macroeconomic theory to relate money supply and money demand to interest rates  and to relate labor supply and labor demand to wage rates     according to hamid s  hosseini  the power of supply and demand was understood to some extent by several early muslim scholars  such as fourteenth century mamluk scholar ibn taymiyyah  who wrote   if desire for goods increases while its availability decreases  its price rises  on the other hand  if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases  the price comes down          ibn taymiyyah         john locke s      work some considerations on the consequences of the lowering of interest and the raising of the value of money     includes an early and clear description of supply and demand and their relationship  in this description demand is rent   the price of any commodity rises or falls by the proportion of the number of buyer and sellers  and  that which regulates the price    of goods is nothing else but their quantity in proportion to their rent      the phrase  supply and demand  was first used by james denham steuart in his inquiry into the principles of political economy  published in       adam smith used the phrase in his      book the wealth of nations  and david ricardo titled one chapter of his      work principles of political economy and taxation  on the influence of demand and supply on price         in the wealth of nations  smith generally assumed that the supply price was fixed but that its  merit   value  would decrease as its  scarcity  increased  in effect what was later called the law of demand also  ricardo  in principles of political economy and taxation  more rigorously laid down the idea of the assumptions that were used to build his ideas of supply and demand  antoine augustin cournot first developed a mathematical model of supply and demand in his      researches into the mathematical principles of wealth  including diagrams     during the late   th century the marginalist school of thought emerged  this field mainly was started by stanley jevons  carl menger  and l on walras  the key idea was that the price was set by the most expensive price  that is  the price at the margin  this was a substantial change from adam smith s thoughts on determining the supply price     in his      essay  on the graphical representation of supply and demand   fleeming jenkin in the course of  introducing the diagrammatic method into the english economic literature  published the first drawing of supply and demand curves therein     including comparative statics from a shift of supply or demand and application to the labor market     the model was further developed and popularized by alfred marshall in the      textbook principles of economics        wars typically causes the diversion  destruction and creation of capital assets as capital assets are both destroyed or consumed and diverted to types of production needed to fight the war  many assets are wasted and in some few cases created specifically to fight a war  war driven demands may be a powerful stimulus for the accumulation of capital and production capability in limited areas and market expansion outside the immediate theatre of war  often this has induced laws against perceived and real war profiteering  the total hours worked in the united states rose by    percent during world war ii  even although the military draft reduced the civilian labor force by    percent        war destruction can be illustrated by looking at world war ii  industrial war damage was heaviest in japan  where     of factory buildings and     of plant   equipment were destroyed      of electric power generating capacity was destroyed and     of oil refining capacity  the japanese merchant fleet lost     of their ships  in germany in       when air attacks were heaviest       of machine tools were damaged or destroyed  but around     were later repaired  about     of steel production capacity was lost  in europe  the united states and the soviet union enormous resources were accumulated and ultimately dissipated as planes  ships tanks  etc  were built and then lost or destroyed     germany s total war damage was estimated at about       of the pre war total capital stock by value  i e   about      in the berlin area alone  there were   million refugees lacking basic necessities  in       less than     of the railways were still operating       rail bridges were destroyed and a total of      bridges         locomotives and more than         goods wagons were destroyed  less than     of the remaining locomotives were operational     however  by the first quarter of      european rail traffic  which was given assistance and preferences  by western appointed military governors  for resources and material as an essential asset  regained its prewar operational level  at the end of the year      of germany s railway lines were operating again  in retrospect  the rapidity of infrastructure reconstruction appears astonishing     initially  in may       newly installed u s  president harry s  truman s directive had been that no steps would be taken towards economic rehabilitation of germany  in fact  the initial industry plan of      prohibited production in excess of half of the      level  the iron and steel industry was allowed to produce only less than a third of pre war output  these plans were rapidly revised and better plans were instituted  in       over     of germany s physical capital stock  plant   equipment  was also dismantled and confiscated  most of it going to the ussr  by       industrial production in germany was at     of the      level  and industrial investment at about     the      level     the first big strike wave in the ruhr occurred in early      it was about food rations and housing  but soon there were demands for nationalisation  the u s  appointed military governor  newman  however stated at the time that he had the power to break strikes by withholding food rations  the clear message was   no work  no eat   as the military controls in western germany were nearly all relinquished and the germans were allowed to rebuild their own economy with marshal plan aid things rapidly improved  by       german industrial production had overtaken the prewar level  the marshall aid funds were important  but  after the currency reform  which permitted german capitalists to revalue their assets  and the establishment of a new political system  much more important was the commitment of the usa to rebuilding german capitalism and establishing a free market economy and government  rather than keeping germany in a weak position  initially  average real wages remained low  lower even than in       until the early     s  while profitability was unusually high  so the total investment fund  aided by credits  was also high  resulting in a high rate of capital accumulation which was nearly all reinvested in new construction or new tools  this was called the german economic miracle or  wirtschaftswunder         in italy  the victorious allies did three things in       they imposed their absolute military authority  they quickly disarmed the italian partisans from a very large stock of weapons  and they agreed to a state guarantee of wage payments  as well as a veto on all sackings of workers from their jobs     although the italian communist party grew very large immediately after the war ended it achieved a membership of     million people in a population of    million it was outmaneouvred through a complicated political battle by the christian democrats  after three years     in the     s  an economic boom began in italy  at first fuelled by internal demand  and then also by exports        in the united states in world war ii the large investments in industrial plant necessitated by the war brought big advantages  but the costs of dead  waste and debt would have never been undertaken by any rational government for the slight advantages     in modern times  it has often been possible to rebuild physical capital assets destroyed in wars completely within the space of about    years  except in cases of severe pollution by chemical warfare or other kinds of irreparable devastation  however  damage to human capital has been much more devastating  in terms of fatalities  in the case of world war ii  about    million deaths   permanent physical disability  enduring ethnic hostility and psychological injuries which have effects for at least several generations     there are many variants of capitalism in existence that differ according to country and region  they vary in their institutional makeup and by their economic policies  the common features among all the different forms of capitalism is that they are based on the production of goods and services for profit  predominately market based allocation of resources  and they are structured upon the accumulation of capital  the major forms of capitalism are listed below     advanced capitalism is the situation that pertains in a society in which the capitalist model has been integrated and developed deeply and extensively and for a prolonged period  various writers identify antonio gramsci as an influential early theorist of advanced capitalism  even if he did not use the term himself  in his writings gramsci sought to explain how capitalism had adapted to avoid the revolutionary overthrow that had seemed inevitable in the   th century  at the heart of his explanation was the decline of raw coercion as a tool of class power  replaced by use of civil society institutions to manipulate public ideology in the capitalists  favour              j rgen habermas has been a major contributor to the analysis of advanced capitalistic societies  habermas observed four general features that characterise advanced capitalism     finance capitalism is the subordination of processes of production to the accumulation of money profits in a financial system     the meaning of the term financial capitalism goes beyond the importance of financial intermediation in the modern capitalist economy  it also encompasses the significant influence of the wealth holders on the political process and the aims of economic policy        financial capitalism is thus a form of capitalism where the intermediation of saving to investment becomes a dominant function in the economy  with wider implications for the political process and social evolution     since the late   th century it has become the predominant force in the global economy     whether in neoliberal or other form     essentially  finance capitalism is a noticeable aspect of modern capitalism     characterised by a predominance of the pursuit of profit from the purchase and sale of  or investment in  currencies and financial products such as bonds  stocks  futures and other derivatives  it also includes the lending of money at interest  and is seen by marxist analysts  from whom the term finance capitalism originally derived  as being exploitative by supplying income to non labourers     academic defenders of the economic concept of capitalism  such as eugen von b hm bawerk  see such profits as part of the roundabout process by which it grows and hedges against inevitable risks        c  h  sisson saw the underlying theme of the cantos of ezra pound as the depredations of finance capital   the monstrous aberration of a world in which reality is distorted  down to a detail never so comprehensively implicated before  by the pull of a fictitious money         in their critique of capitalism  marxism and leninism both emphasise the role of  finance capital  as the determining and ruling class interest in capitalist society  particularly in the latter stages           rudolf hilferding is credited with first bringing the term finance capitalism into prominence  with his        study of the links between german trusts  banks  and monopolies before world war i   a study subsumed by lenin into his wartime analysis of the imperialist relations of the great world powers     lenin concluded of the banks at that time that they were  the chief nerve centres of the whole capitalist system of national economy      for the comintern  the phrase  dictatorship of finance capitalism     became a regular one     braudel would later point to two earlier periods when finance capitalism had emerged in human history   with the genoese in the   th century and the dutch in the   th and   th centuries   although at those points it was from commercial capitalism that it developed     giovanni arrighi extended braudel s analysis to suggest that a predominance of finance capitalism is a recurring  long term phenomenon  whenever a previous phase of commercial industrial capitalist expansion reaches a plateau        mercantilism is a nationalist form of early capitalism that came into existence approximately in the late   th century  it is characterized by the intertwining of national business interests to state interest and imperialism  and consequently  the state apparatus is utilized to advance national business interests abroad  an example of this is colonists living in america who were only allowed to trade with and purchase goods from their respective mother countries  e  g  britain  portugal  france   mercantilism was driven by the belief that the wealth of a nation is increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations  it corresponds to the phase of capitalist development sometimes called the primitive accumulation of capital     free market economy refers to a capitalist economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy  it typically entails support for highly competitive markets  private ownership of productive enterprises  laissez faire is a more extensive form of free market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting property rights     a social market economy is a nominally free market system where government intervention in price formation is kept to a minimum but the state provides significant services in the area of social security  unemployment benefits and recognition of labor rights through national collective bargaining arrangements  this model is prominent in western and northern european countries  and japan  albeit in slightly different configurations  the vast majority of enterprises are privately owned in this economic model     rhine capitalism refers to the contemporary model of capitalism and adaptation of the social market model that exists in continental western europe today     state capitalism consists of state ownership of the means of production within a state  and the organization of state enterprises as commercial  profit seeking businesses  the debate between proponents of private versus state capitalism is centered around questions of managerial efficacy  productive efficiency  and fair distribution of wealth     according to aldo musacchio  a professor at harvard business school  state capitalism is a system in which governments  whether democratic or autocratic  exercise a widespread influence on the economy  through either direct ownership or various subsidies  musacchio also says there is a considerable difference between today s state capitalism and its predecessors  in his opinion  gone are the days when governments appointed bureaucrats to run companies  the world s largest state owned enterprises are now traded on the public markets and kept in good health by large institutional investors        corporate capitalism is a free or mixed market economy characterized by the dominance of hierarchical  bureaucratic corporations     a mixed economy is a largely market based economy consisting of both private and public ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures  reduce unemployment and keep inflation low  the degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries  some mixed economies  such as france under dirigisme  also featured a degree of indirect economic planning over a largely capitalist based economy     most modern capitalist economies are defined as  mixed economies  to some degree citation needed    other variants of capitalism include     in a capitalist system  the government does not prohibit private property or prevent individuals from working where they please  the government does not prevent firms from determining what wages they will pay and what prices they will charge for their products  many countries  however  have minimum wage laws and minimum safety standards     under some versions of capitalism  the government carries out a number of economic functions  such as issuing money  supervising public utilities and enforcing private contracts  many countries have competition laws that prohibit monopolies and cartels from forming  despite anti monopoly laws  large corporations can form near monopolies in some industries  such firms can temporarily drop prices and accept losses to prevent competition from entering the market  and then raise them again once the threat of entry is reduced  in many countries  public utilities  e g  electricity  heating fuel  communications  are able to operate as a monopoly under government regulation  due to high economies of scale     government agencies regulate the standards of service in many industries  such as airlines and broadcasting  as well as financing a wide range of programs  in addition  the government regulates the flow of capital and uses financial tools such as the interest rate to control factors such as inflation and unemployment        democratic socialists argue that the role of the state in a capitalist society is to defend the interests of the bourgeoisie     these governments take actions to implement such things as unified national markets  national currencies  and customs system     capitalist governments have also been criticised as oligarchic in nature    due to the inevitable inequality       characteristic of economic progress           critics of capitalism associate the economic system with social inequality  unfair distribution of wealth and power  materialism  repression of workers and trade unionists  social alienation  economic inequality  unemployment  and economic instability  many socialists consider capitalism to be irrational  in that production and the direction of the economy are unplanned  creating many inconsistencies and internal contradictions     capitalism and individual property rights have been associated with the tragedy of the anticommons  marxian economist richard d  wolff postulates that capitalist economies prioritize profits and capital accumulation over the social needs of communities  and capitalist enterprises rarely include the workers in the basic decisions of the enterprise        some labor historians and scholars have argued that unfree labor   by slaves  indentured servants  prisoners or other coerced persons   is compatible with capitalist relations  tom brass argued that unfree labor is acceptable to capital        historian greg grandin argues that capitalism has its origins in slavery   when historians talk about the atlantic market revolution  they are talking about capitalism  and when they are talking about capitalism  they are talking about slavery      in his book the half has never been told  historian edward e  baptist of cornell university claims that slavery was an integral component in the violent development of american and global capitalism        according to immanuel wallerstein  institutional racism has been  one of the most significant pillars  of the capitalist system and serves as  the ideological justification for the hierarchization of the work force and its highly unequal distributions of reward         many aspects of capitalism have come under attack from the anti globalization movement  which is primarily opposed to corporate capitalism  environmentalists have argued that capitalism requires continual economic growth  and that it will inevitably deplete the finite natural resources of earth        such critics argue that while this neoliberalism or contemporary capitalism has indeed increased global trade  it has also destroyed traditional ways of life  exacerbated inequality and increased global poverty   with more living today in abject poverty than before neoliberalism  and that environmental indicators indicate massive environmental degradation since the late     s          some scholars blame the financial crisis of         on the neoliberal capitalist model                 following the banking crisis of       alan greenspan told the united states congress on october            the whole intellectual edifice collapsed  i made a mistake in presuming that the self interests of organizations  specifically banks and others  were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders      i was shocked         many religions have criticized or opposed specific elements of capitalism  traditional judaism  christianity  and islam forbid lending money at interest        although alternative methods of banking have been developed  some christians have criticized capitalism for its materialist aspects and its inability to account for the wellbeing of all people     many of jesus  parables deal with economic concerns  farming  shepherding  being in debt  doing hard labor  being excluded from banquets and the houses of the rich  and have implications for wealth and power distribution        catholic scholars and clergy have often criticized capitalism because of its disenfranchisement of the poor often promoting distributism as an alternative  in his    page apostolic exhortation evangelii gaudium  pope francis described unfettered capitalism as  a new tyranny  and called on world leaders to fight rising poverty and inequality        some people continue to defend trickle down theories which assume that economic growth  encouraged by a free market  will inevitably succeed in bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world  this opinion  which has never been confirmed by the facts  expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system  meanwhile  the excluded are still waiting        proponents of capitalism argue that it creates more prosperity than any other economic system  and that its benefits are mainly to the ordinary person     critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability     an inability to provide for the well being of all people     and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment     socialists maintain that  although capitalism is superior to all previously existing economic systems  such as feudalism or slavery   the contradiction between class interests will only be resolved by advancing into a completely new social system of production and distribution in which all persons have an equal relationship to the means of production        the term capitalism  in its modern sense  is often attributed to karl marx      in his magnum opus capital  marx analysed the  capitalist mode of production  using a method of understanding today known as marxism  however  marx himself rarely used the term  capitalism   while it was used twice in the more political interpretations of his work  primarily authored by his collaborator friedrich engels  in the   th century  defenders of the capitalist system often replaced the term capitalism with phrases such as free enterprise and private enterprise and replaced capitalist with rentier and investor in reaction to the negative connotations associated with capitalism       the majority of criticisms against the profit motive centre on the idea that profits should not supersede the needs of people  michael moore s film sicko  for example  attacks the healthcare industry for its alleged emphasis on profits at the expense of patients     moore explains     another common criticism of the profit motive is that it is believed to encourage selfishness and greed  critics of the profit motive contend that companies disregard morals or public safety in the pursuit of profits        free market economists counter that the profit motive  coupled with competition  actually reduces the final price of an item for consumption  rather than raising it  they argue that businesses profit by selling a good at a lower price and at a greater volume than the competition  economist thomas sowell uses supermarkets as an example to illustrate this point   it has been estimated that a supermarket makes a clear profit of about a penny on a dollar of sales  if that sounds pretty skimpy  remember that it is collecting that penny on every dollar at several cash registers simultaneously and  in many cases  around the clock         economist milton friedman has argued that greed and self interest are universal human traits  on a      episode of the phil donahue show  friedman states   the world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests   he continues by explaining that only in capitalist countries  where individuals can pursue their own self interest  people have been able to escape from  grinding poverty         author and philosopher ayn rand defended selfishness on ethical grounds  her nonfiction work  the virtue of selfishness  argues that selfishness is a moral good and not an excuse to act with disregard for others     many economic and political theories advocate for an economy without the profit system and thus the profit motive  such as     examples of economic models without the profit motive include     some political theories advocate extensive government regulation over the ability for businesses to pursue profit  without abolishing the profit system  namely     some other political theories advocate a middle level of government involvement in the ability of individuals to realize their profit motive     marx considered capitalism to be a historically specific mode of production  the way in which the productive property is owned and controlled  combined with the corresponding social relations between individuals based on their connection with the process of production  in which capitalism has become the dominant mode of production       the capitalist stage of development or  bourgeois society   for marx  represented the most advanced form of social organization to date  but he also thought that the working classes would come to power in a worldwide socialist or communist transformation of human society as the end of the series of first aristocratic  then capitalist  and finally working class rule was reached           following adam smith  marx distinguished the use value of commodities from their exchange value in the market  capital  according to marx  is created with the purchase of commodities for the purpose of creating new commodities with an exchange value higher than the sum of the original purchases  for marx  the use of labor power had itself become a commodity under capitalism  the exchange value of labor power  as reflected in the wage  is less than the value it produces for the capitalist     this difference in values  he argues  constitutes surplus value  which the capitalists extract and accumulate  in his book capital  marx argues that the capitalist mode of production is distinguished by how the owners of capital extract this surplus from workers all prior class societies had extracted surplus labor  but capitalism was new in doing so via the sale value of produced commodities     he argues that a core requirement of a capitalist society is that a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self sustenance that would allow them to be independent  and are instead forced to sell their labor for a wage              in conjunction with his criticism of capitalism was marx s belief that the working class  due to its relationship to the means of production and numerical superiority under capitalism  would be the driving force behind the socialist revolution     this argument is intertwined with marx s version of the labor theory of value arguing that labor is the source of all value  and thus of profit     vladimir lenin  in imperialism  the highest stage of capitalism         further developed marxist theory and argued that capitalism necessarily led to monopoly capitalism and the export of capital which he also called  imperialism  to find new markets and resources  representing the last and highest stage of capitalism     some   th century marxian economists consider capitalism to be a social formation where capitalist class processes dominate  but are not exclusive        capitalist class processes  to these thinkers  are simply those in which surplus labor takes the form of surplus value  usable as capital  other tendencies for utilization of labor nonetheless exist simultaneously in existing societies where capitalist processes predominate  however  other late marxian thinkers argue that a social formation as a whole may be classed as capitalist if capitalism is the mode by which a surplus is extracted  even if this surplus is not produced by capitalist activity  as when an absolute majority of the population is engaged in non capitalist economic activity        in limits to capital         david harvey outlines an overdetermined   spatially restless  capitalism coupled with the spatiality of crisis formation and resolution     harvey used marx s theory of crisis to aid his argument that capitalism must have its  fixes  but that we cannot predetermine what fixes will be implemented  nor in what form they will be  his work on contractions of capital accumulation and international movements of capitalist modes of production and money flows has been influential     according to harvey  capitalism creates the conditions for volatile and geographically uneven development        at least two assumptions are necessary for the validity of the standard model  first  that supply and demand are independent  second  that supply is  constrained by a fixed resource   if these conditions do not hold  then the marshallian model cannot be sustained  sraffa s critique focused on the inconsistency  except in implausible circumstances  of partial equilibrium analysis and the rationale for the upward slope of the supply curve in a market for a produced consumption good     the notability of sraffa s critique is also demonstrated by paul a  samuelson s comments and engagements with it over many years  for example     aggregate excess demand in a market is the difference between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied as a function of price  in the model with an upward sloping supply curve and downward sloping demand curve  the aggregate excess demand function only intersects the axis at one point  namely  at the point where the supply and demand curves intersect  the sonnenschein mantel debreu theorem shows that the standard model cannot be rigorously derived in general from general equilibrium theory        the model of prices being determined by supply and demand assumes perfect competition  but     goodwin  nelson  ackerman  and weisskopf write     austrian school economists have argued that capitalism can organise itself into a complex system without an external guidance or central planning mechanism  friedrich hayek considered the phenomenon of self organisation as underpinning capitalism  prices serve as a signal as to the urgent and unfilled wants of people  and the opportunity to earn profits if successful  or absorb losses if resources are used poorly or left idle  gives entrepreneurs incentive to use their knowledge and resources to satisfy those wants  thus the activities of millions of people  each seeking his own interest  are coordinated        the novelist and philosopher ayn rand made positive moral defences of laissez faire capitalism  most notably in her      novel atlas shrugged  and in her      collection of essays capitalism  the unknown ideal  she argued that capitalism should be supported on moral grounds  not just on the basis of practical benefits        she has significantly influenced conservative and libertarian supporters of capitalism  especially in the american tea party movement        many theorists and policymakers in predominantly capitalist nations have emphasised capitalism s ability to promote economic growth  as measured by gross domestic product  gdp   capacity utilization or standard of living  this argument was central  for example  to adam smith s advocacy of letting a free market control production and price  and allocate resources  many theorists have noted that this increase in global gdp over time coincides with the emergence of the modern world capitalist system           between      and       the world economy grew sixfold  a faster rate than the population growth  so each individual enjoyed  on the average  a     increase in wealth  between      and       world economy grew    fold  a much faster rate than the population growth  so each individual enjoyed  on the average  a   fold increase in wealth     in most capitalist economic regions such as europe  the united states  canada  australia and new zealand  the economy grew    fold per person  even though these countries already had a higher starting level  and in japan  which was poor in       the increase per person was    fold  in the third world there was an increase  but only   fold per person        proponents argue that increasing gdp  per capita  is empirically shown to bring about improved standards of living  such as better availability of food  housing  clothing  and health care     the decrease in the number of hours worked per week and the decreased participation of children and the elderly in the workforce have been attributed to capitalism           in his book the road to serfdom  freidrich hayek asserts that the economic freedom of capitalism is a requisite of political freedom  he argues that the market mechanism is the only way of deciding what to produce and how to distribute the items without using coercion  milton friedman  andrew brennan and ronald reagan also promoted this view  friedman claimed that centralized economic operations are always accompanied by political repression  in his view  transactions in a market economy are voluntary  and that the wide diversity that voluntary activity permits is a fundamental threat to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish their power to coerce  some of friedman s views were shared by john maynard keynes  who believed that capitalism is vital for freedom to survive and thrive        freedom house  an american think tank that conducts international research on  and advocates for  democracy  political freedom  and human rights  has argued  there is a high and statistically significant correlation between the level of political freedom as measured by freedom house and economic freedom as measured by the wall street journal heritage foundation survey         although the term  liberalism  retains its original meaning in most of the world  it has unfortunately come to have a very different meaning in late twentieth century america  hence terms such as  market liberalism    classical liberalism   or  libertarianism  are often used in its place in america
