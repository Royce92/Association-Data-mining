 a subnotebook  also called an ultraportable or mini notebook  is a class of laptop computers that are smaller and lighter than a typical notebook     these computers are sometimes confused with the ultra mobile pc category  which is the name of a platform of small form factor tablet pcs  umpcs are smaller than subnotebooks  however both generally are found to run full desktop operating systems such as windows or linux  rather than specialized software such as windows ce  palm os  or internet tablet os  subnotebooks are also sometimes confused with netbooks which are a different category of devices that branched off from mini notebooks in general  netbooks are most often much less expensive than subnotebooks  as they are optimized for use as portable internet capable devices and generally lack the processing power of a workstation  netbooks typically have  w tdp cpus  sacrificing performance for power efficiency  whereas subnotebooks often use   w tdp processors     subnotebooks are smaller than full sized laptops but larger than handheld computers  they often have smaller sized screens  less than   xa inches  and weigh less than typical laptops  usually being less than  xa kg     xa lbs   the savings in size and weight are usually achieved partly by omitting ports or having removable media or optical disc drives  many can be paired with docking stations to compensate             the compaq lte  launched in       was the first to be widely known as a  notebook computer  because its relatively small dimensions          xa cm                xa inches  were similar to an a  paper notebook  the compaq was followed in october      by the very popular ibm thinkpad  which was the first to include a       xa cm      xa inches  screen in a notebook measuring                  xa cm                  xa inches   portables with smaller form factors thus became known as subnotebooks  the term was also applied to the nec ultralite  unveiled in      its dimensions                   xa inches  were very similar to the compaq lte     smaller dos based pcs such as the poqet pc and the atari portfolio both released in      were called either  pocket pcs  or handhelds     one early subnotebook was the powerbook     released in      by apple inc   measuring      deep by     wide by      high and weighing    xa lbs      xa kg    then the gateway handbook  originally released in      and updated to use a     processor in late       was only    xa inches     xa mm  wide     xa inches     xa mm  deep  and    xa inches    xa mm  high  and weighed less than three pounds     xa kg citation needed  apple followed up with powerbook duo series in october       which further reduced their subnotebook line to      deep by       wide by      high and is an example of a portable supporting few on board features  but which could be inserted into a docking station to achieve the full functionality of a desktop   a feature soon emulated by other manufacturers citation needed    another early subnotebook was the hewlett packard omnibook      which was launched as a  superportable  in       it measured                 xa inches  and was available with an optional flash memory disk instead of a hard drive  to reduce the weight      toshiba  which had concentrated on portables in the     s  also entered the market that year with the portege t      claiming that  it s the first subnotebook computer with all the functionality of a much larger computer    the version with an      monochrome screen measured just                xa inches and weighed    xa kg  toshiba also introduced the t    ct at this time which was the first subnotebook with a color screen     then toshiba really put the subnotebook pc format on the map in      with the libretto     this featured a      screen and     mb hard disk  cnet reported about the libretto   ct that  it is the first full fledged windows    notebook in the united states weighing less than two pounds       compaq introduced its own short lived subnotebook line in      called contura aero  which had two models  the greyscale display      and the color       notable for using a battery which was intended to be standard rather than only useful for compaq products     in       apple launched the relatively light weight     xa lbs  but short lived powerbook     c  this was co designed by ibm and made for apple by ibm japan to replace the aging powerbook duo line  however  it measured                 xa inches  so it was actually bigger than a compaq lte notebook  ibm had sold  thin and light  models in its thinkpad range  such as the thinkpad     ultraportable        and best selling thinkpad             it finally entered the subnotebook market in      with the    xa kg thinkpad      targeted at business travellers   the     and    x had       screens  later  however  ibm replaced these with the x range  with       screens  at               the thinkpad x   is not much smaller than a        by        and better described as an ultraportable  rather than a subnotebook     sony launched an ultraportable  ultrathin  less than an inch thick in japan in       the pcg      which reached the us in      as the vaio    gx  this was followed by the even thinner sony vaio x     which measured just                 xa inches  and reached      at its thinnest   however  it was very expensive and had poor battery life  and was soon withdrawn     sony also launched the c  range of subnotebooks  starting in japan in january      citation needed    one of the most notable sony models was the transmeta based vaio pcg c ve or picturebook         which measured only        xa inches  it had a digital camera built into the lid  which could be used for video conferencing or swivelled round to photograph a scene      this was followed in      by the transmeta based flybook convertible with a touch sensitive    xa inch  widescreen from taiwan s dialogue technology   later models used intel ulv processors   the flybook features a built in phone connection for gprs or  g networking  and is available in a range of bright colors  this attracted the attention of non computer magazines including gq  fhm  elle and rolling stone   dimensions of             put the original flybook a  i on a par with the libretto   but styled to appeal more to fashion models than computer geeks     in       microsoft stimulated a new round of subnotebook development with the umpc or ultra mobile pc format code named origami  these are basically small versions of tablet pc computers  which originally shipped with the microsoft windows xp tablet pc edition       an example is the samsung q  citation needed    in       the asus eee pc was the first of a new class of low cost subnotebook commonly called the netbook  these devices are based around using the internet  netbooks are typically based upon the atom processors  while subnotebooks use more powerful processors such as ulv types contradiction    at computex       intel announced a new class of subnotebooks called ultrabooks  the term is used to describe a highly portable laptop that has strict limits on size  weight and battery life and has tablet like features such as instant on functionality
