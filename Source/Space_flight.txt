 spaceflight  also written space flight  is ballistic flight into or through outer space  spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board  examples of human spaceflight include the russian soyuz program  the u s  space shuttle program  as well as the ongoing international space station  examples of unmanned spaceflight include space probes that leave earth orbit  as well as satellites in orbit around earth  such as communication satellites  these operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous     spaceflight is used in space exploration  and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications  additional non commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories  reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites     a spaceflight typically begins with a rocket launch  which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth  once in space  the motion of a spacecraft both when unpropelled and when under propulsion is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics  some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely  some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry  and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact     the realistic proposal of space travel goes back to konstantin tsiolkovsky  his most famous work                                                            the exploration of cosmic space by means of reaction devices   was published in       but this theoretical work was not widely influential outside russia     spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of robert h  goddard s publication in      of his paper  a method of reaching extreme altitudes   where his application of the de laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible  he also proved in the laboratory that rockets would work in the vacuum of space  not all scientists of that day believed they would  this paper was highly influential on hermann oberth and wernher von braun  later key players in spaceflight     the first rocket to reach space  an altitude of    xa km  was the german v   rocket  on a test flight in june        on   october       the soviet union launched sputnik    which became the first artificial satellite to orbit the earth  the first human spaceflight was vostok   on april           aboard which soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin made one orbit around the earth  the lead architects behind the soviet space program s vostok   mission were the rocket scientists sergey korolyov and kerim kerimov      rockets are the only means currently capable of reaching orbit  other non rocket spacelaunch technologies have yet to be built  or remain short of orbital speeds     a rocket launch for a spaceflight usually starts from a spaceport  cosmodrome   which may be equipped with launch complexes and launch pads for vertical rocket launches  and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft  spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons  icbms have various special launching facilities     a launch is often restricted to certain launch windows  these windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site  the biggest influence is often the rotation of the earth itself  once launched  orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the earth  and the earth rotates within this orbit     a launch pad is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles  it generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench  it is surrounded by equipment used to erect  fuel  and maintain launch vehicles     the most commonly used definition of outer space is everything beyond the k rm n line  which is     kilometers    xa mi  above the earth s surface   the united states sometimes defines outer space as everything beyond    miles    xa km  in altitude      rockets are the only currently practical means of reaching space  conventional airplane engines cannot reach space due to the lack of oxygen  rocket engines expel propellant to provide forward thrust that generates enough delta v  change in velocity  to reach orbit     for manned launch systems launch escape systems are frequently fitted to allow astronauts to escape in the case of catastrophic failures     many ways to reach space other than rockets have been proposed  ideas such as the space elevator  and momentum exchange tethers like rotovators or skyhooks require new materials much stronger than any currently known  electromagnetic launchers such as launch loops might be feasible with current technology  other ideas include rocket assisted aircraft spaceplanes such as reaction engines skylon  currently in early stage development   scramjet powered spaceplanes  and rbcc powered spaceplanes  gun launch has been proposed for cargo     achieving a closed orbit is not essential to lunar and interplanetary voyages  early russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit  nasa considered launching apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory  this costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because it will never be reached     however  the parking orbit approach greatly simplified apollo mission planning in several important ways  it substantially widened the allowable launch windows  increasing the chance of a successful launch despite minor technical problems during the countdown  the parking orbit was a stable  mission plateau  that gave the crew and controllers several hours to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it to a long lunar flight  the crew could quickly return to earth  if necessary  or an alternate earth orbital mission could be conducted  the parking orbit also enabled translunar trajectories that avoided the densest parts of the van allen radiation belts     apollo missions minimized the performance penalty of the parking orbit by keeping its altitude as low as possible  for example  apollo    used an unusually low parking orbit  even for apollo  of      nmi by      nmi     xa km by    xa km  where there was significant atmospheric drag  but it was partially overcome by continuous venting of hydrogen from the third stage of the saturn v  and was in any event tolerable for the short stay     robotic missions do not require an abort capability or radiation minimization  and because modern launchers routinely meet  instantaneous  launch windows  space probes to the moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance  although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence  they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an earth escape trajectory     note that the escape velocity from a celestial body decreases with altitude above that body  however  it is more fuel efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close to the ground as possible  see oberth effect and reference   this is another way to explain the performance penalty associated with establishing the safe perigee of a parking orbit     plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in earth orbit  such as nasa s project orion and russia s kliper parom tandem     astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories  particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects  astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use  an orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits     non rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sails  magnetic sails  plasma bubble magnetic systems  and using gravitational slingshot effects     vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy  this energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere  typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating  the theory behind reentry was developed by harry julian allen  based on this theory  reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry  blunt shapes mean that less than    of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead ends up in the atmosphere     the mercury  gemini  and apollo capsules all splashed down in the sea  these capsules were designed to land at relatively slow speeds  russian capsules for soyuz make use of braking rockets as were designed to touch down on land  the space shuttle and buran glide to a touchdown at high speed     after a successful landing the spacecraft  its occupants and cargo can be recovered  in some cases  recovery has occurred before landing  while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute  it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft  this mid air retrieval technique was used to recover the film canisters from the corona spy satellites     the first human spaceflight was vostok   on april           on which cosmonaut yuri gagarin of the ussr made one orbit around the earth  in official soviet documents  there is no mention of the fact that gagarin parachuted the final seven miles   the international rules for aviation records stated that  the pilot remains in his craft from launch to landing  citation needed this rule  if applied  would have  disqualified  gagarin s spaceflight  currently  the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are the russian soyuz spacecraft and the chinese shenzhou spacecraft  the u s  space shuttle fleet has been retired  spaceshipone has conducted two human suborbital spaceflights     on a sub orbital spaceflight the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a  primarily  ballistic trajectory  this is usually because of insufficient specific orbital energy  in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes  but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the earth s atmosphere  sometimes after many hours  pioneer   was nasa s first space probe intended to reach the moon  a partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of         kilometers        xa mi  before reentering the earth s atmosphere    hours after launch     the most generally recognized boundary of space is the k rm n line    xa km above sea level   nasa alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than    miles    xa km  or   xa km above sea level   it is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the k rm n line is only about    of the orbital energy  potential plus kinetic energy  required by the lowest possible earth orbit  a circular orbit just above the k rm n line   in other words  it is far easier to reach space than to stay there     on may           civilian space exploration team launched the gofast rocket on a suborbital flight  the first amateur spaceflight  on june           spaceshipone was used for the first privately funded human spaceflight     point to point sub orbital spaceflight is a category of spaceflight in which a spacecraft uses a sub orbital flight for transportation  this can provide a two hour trip from london to sydney  which is a great improvement over what is currently over a twenty hour flight  today  no company offers this type of spaceflight for transportation  however  virgin galactic has plans for a spaceplane called spaceshipthree  which could offer this service in the future      suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low earth orbit   if rockets are used  the size of the rocket relative to the payload is similar to an intercontinental ballistic missile  icbm   any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmosphere re entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight     a minimal orbital spaceflight requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub orbital flight  and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve  to achieve orbital spaceflight  the tangential velocity around the earth is as important as altitude  in order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space  the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit     interplanetary travel is travel between planets within a single planetary system  in practice  the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of the solar system     five spacecraft are currently leaving the solar system on escape trajectories  the one farthest from the sun is voyager    which is more than     au distant and is moving at     au per year   in comparison proxima centauri  the closest star other than the sun  is         au distant  it will take voyager   over        years to reach this distance  vehicle designs using other techniques  such as nuclear pulse propulsion are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster     another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation  as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little  in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on board time  however  attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new  advanced method of propulsion     intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies  and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and  by current engineering terms  is considered science fiction     spacecraft are vehicles capable of controlling their trajectory through space     the first  true spacecraft  is sometimes said to be apollo lunar module   since this was the only manned vehicle to have been designed for  and operated only in space  and is notable for its non aerodynamic shape     spacecraft today predominantly use rockets for propulsion  but other propulsion techniques such as ion drives are becoming more common  particularly for unmanned vehicles  and this can significantly reduce the vehicle s mass and increase its delta v     all current spaceflight uses multi stage expendable launch systems to reach space     the first reusable spacecraft  the x     was air launched on a suborbital trajectory on july           the first partially reusable orbital spacecraft  the space shuttle  was launched by the usa on the   th anniversary of yuri gagarin s flight  on april           during the shuttle era  six orbiters were built  all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space  the enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests  launching from the back of a boeing     and gliding to deadstick landings at edwards afb  california  the first space shuttle to fly into space was the columbia  followed by the challenger  discovery  atlantis  and endeavour  the endeavour was built to replace the challenger  which was lost in january       the columbia broke up during reentry in february          the first  and so far only  automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the buran  snowstorm   launched by the ussr on november           although it made only one flight  this spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the u  s  space shuttle  although its drop off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the american shuttle  lack of funding  complicated by the dissolution of the ussr  prevented any further flights of buran     per the vision for space exploration  the space shuttle was retired in      due mainly to its old age and high cost of the program reaching over a billion dollars per flight  the shuttle s human transport role is to be replaced by the partially reusable crew exploration vehicle  cev  no later than       the shuttle s heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the evolved expendable launch vehicle  eelv  or a shuttle derived launch vehicle     scaled composites spaceshipone was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots mike melvill and brian binnie on consecutive flights in      to win the ansari x prize  the spaceship company will build its successor spaceshiptwo  a fleet of spaceshiptwos operated by virgin galactic planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers  space tourists  in       but this was delayed due to an accident in the propulsion development       all launch vehicles contain a huge amount of energy that is needed for some part of it to reach orbit  there is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly  with significant effects  when a delta ii rocket exploded    seconds after launch on january           there were reports of store windows    miles    xa km  away being broken by the blast       space is a fairly predictable environment  but there are still risks of accidental depressurization and the potential failure of equipment  some of which may be very newly developed     in      the international association for the advancement of space safety was established in the netherlands to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety       in a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the earth  humans experience a sense of  weightlessness   short term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome  a self limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system  long term exposure causes multiple health issues  the most significant is bone loss  some of which is permanent  but microgravity also leads to significant deconditioning of muscular and cardiovascular tissues     once above the atmosphere  radiation due to the van allen belts  solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase     further away from the earth  solar flares can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes  and the health threat from cosmic radiation significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more       in human spaceflight  the life support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space  nasa often uses the phrase environmental control and life support system or the acronym eclss when describing these systems for its human spaceflight missions    the life support system may supply  air  water and food  it must also maintain the correct body temperature  an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body s waste products  shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro meteorites may also be necessary  components of the life support system are life critical  and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques     space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in outer space  it is distinct from the concept of weather within a planetary atmosphere  and deals with phenomena involving ambient plasma  magnetic fields  radiation and other matter in space  generally close to earth but also in interplanetary  and occasionally interstellar medium    space weather describes the conditions in space that affect earth and its technological systems  our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the sun  the nature of earth s magnetic field  and our location in the solar system         space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development  changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in low earth orbit  geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft  or interfere with on board electronics  an understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for manned spacecraft     rockets as a class are not inherently grossly polluting  however  some rockets use toxic propellants  and most vehicles use propellants that are not carbon neutral  many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of perchlorate or other chemicals  and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer  re entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer  most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction     in addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near earth space environment  there is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles  kessler syndrome   many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re entered after use     current and proposed applications for spaceflight include     most early spaceflight development was paid for by governments  however  today major launch markets such as communication satellites and satellite television are purely commercial  though many of the launchers were originally funded by governments     private spaceflight is a rapidly developing area  space flight that is not only paid for by corporations or even private individuals  but often provided by private spaceflight companies  these companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid  this assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private space launch vehicles such as falcon   developed with private financing  lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as space tourism and especially space colonization to become successful
