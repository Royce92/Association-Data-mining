 power grid is the english language edition of the multiplayer german style board game funkenschlag  in its second incarnation  designed by friedemann friese  power grid is published by rio grande games     in the game  each player represents a company that owns power plants and tries to supply electricity to cities  over the course of the game  the players will bid on power plants and buy resources to produce electricity to provide power to the growing number of cities in their expanding network             the game comes with a double sided board with a map of the united states of america on one side and germany on the other  each map consists of six regions featuring cities with connections of varying costs between them  the number of regions used is based on the number of players  map design itself is a key feature in the strategy of game play as some areas of the map feature generally higher connection costs compared to other areas of the map     the game is played in rounds  with each round consisting of   phases     the game ends after one player builds a fixed number of cities  the winner is the player who can supply electricity to the most cities with his network  tie breakers are who has the most money  then the most cities     the game is further divided into    steps   in step one    power plants are visible to players arranged into two rows of four based on their numerical value ranking from lowest to highest  the first row of the lowest numbered plants is available to be bid on by players  in step one  only the first slot of a city may be built into     step two is triggered when any player builds a set number of cities determined by the number of players in the game  in step two the lowest level plant is removed  this is only performed once   in addition  the second city slot becomes available for players to build into  finally  the resource replenishment rate is changed     step three is triggered when the step three card comes up in the power plant deck  the step three card is initially placed at the bottom of the power plant deck  in step    again  the lowest level plant is removed and a new plant is now drawn to replace it  the available power plant pool now consists of   power plants that are all available to be bid on  the remaining power plant deck is shuffled to make a new draw deck     the original game of funkenschlag had players draw their networks using crayons instead of playing on a fixed map  this feature  along with other changes  was removed when friedemann friese reworked the game citation needed the new game is also called funkenschlag in the german market  but is sold under various names elsewhere     the game is currently available under various names for different markets  most featuring the same game play  a few editions  however  offer a slightly different play experience because they ship with non standard maps     the german and u s  editions are virtually identical and they feature the same germany usa maps  any small differences are unintentional consequences of the translation from the original german into english  and most mistakes have been corrected by rio grande games as new editions have been issued     this edition was published in      as a promotional tie in with enbw  a power company in the german state of baden w rttemberg  the german map differs from the one in the original edition in that the city of karlsruhe  the location of enbw s headquarters  appears rather than the neighboring city of mannheim  the second map included in the game is a new map not available elsewhere  featuring enbw s home state of baden w rttemberg  a rule difference between this edition and the original is that determining player order is done after the power plant auction  a difference in the included power plant deck  with    plants rather than    in the original game  the deck does not include plant         the czech slovak edition features the central europe map  from the central europe benelux expansion  and the germany map     the french edition features the france map  from the france italy expansion  and a new map not available elsewhere  quebec  the quebec map makes more use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional availability of hydro electricity     the game is also available in polish  italian  spanish  dutch  chinese  korean  portuguese  and japanese  while these editions feature the original maps of germany usa  and thus are more like translations of the  f game than a new edition  each new deal with a local publisher has coincided with a release of an expansion featuring that publisher s home country     released in      as a   th anniversary edition  this edition features re designed wooden pieces and cards  a double sided board with europe one side and north america on the other  the game also replaces garbage trash with natural gas      all expansions require the original game to play     the france   italy expansion for power grid was published in       the expansion provides a new double sided map allowing play in france and italy  along with the maps are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two countries  france  a land that has embraced nuclear power  has an earlier start with atomic plants and more uranium available  italy has fewer coal and oil resources  but more garbage     the benelux   central europe expansion for power grid was published in       this expansion provides a new double sided map  this time for play in benelux and central europe  again  there are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two regions  benelux  economic union of belgium  the netherlands and luxembourg  has more ecological power plants and more availability of oil  central europe  poland  the czech republic  austria  slovakia and hungary  has rules changes in steps   and    and limits on what type of power plant may be used to power cities in different regions  countries  of the map     the power plant deck   expansion for power grid was published in       the expansion provides a second set of power plant cards  offering variety in gameplay     it was released at spiel  the annual game fair in essen  in          the china   korea expansion for power grid was published in       another map expansion  this time for play in china and korea  again  there are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two regions  on the korean side  players are confronted with expensive connection costs  in addition  because of the political division between north and south  there are two resource markets  in each turn a player must choose only one market to buy resources from  with fewer resources and no uranium available in the north  on the chinese side the market is structured as a planned economy  in this version of the game  there are no surprises the power plants on the power plant market are offered in ascending order during the two first steps of the game   if the game reaches its final stage  then the power plant market becomes more like that in the original game  to reflect the beginnings of economic reform in modern china   additionally  the resource table is designed such that resources are likely to be in short supply as the game proceeds     the brazil spain   portugal expansion  aka brazil iberia  was published in       another map expansion  this time for play in brazil and spain portugal  again  there are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two regions  on the brazilian side  biogas takes the place of garbage  and resources are more scarce than in the original game  brazil also includes special game preparation rules regarding biogas plants  on the spain and portugal side  uranium is important  but not at the beginning of the game  initially  uranium is not added to the market in step    but it is rapidly added in step    this side also has special preparation rules by which certain plants are set aside and re added to the deck during step    additionally  special nuclear rules apply to portugal  namely that players with networks only in portugal are not allowed to own nuclear power plants  both sides of the map also include their own resource resupply tables  this is the only map  so far  that comes with a box that you can use to store it and other expansion maps     this was released october       russia  the market for power plants is restricted in russia  additionally  the standard rules for exchanging out of date power plants are changed  japan  based on the crowded geographical surroundings  the players can start two separate networks in japan  the first connections are restricted to certain cities     this was released november       the robots expansion adds    tiles to create variations of ai players designed to be used when playing with   players     the quebec baden w rttemberg expansion for power grid was published in       the two maps were previously released in two separate power grid base games  qu bec is part of m gawatts  the french edition of the game released by filosofia  while baden w rttemberg was included in funkenschlag  enbw  a german edition of the game from enbw  again  there are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two regions  qu bec places great emphasis on energy production via ecological plants  in baden w rttemberg  turn order is changed  first  you buy power plants  then you rearrange the player order  there are also several transregional locations that only may be connected to in step two and step three     the northern europe united kingdom   ireland expansion for power grid was released at essen       another map expansion  it also includes twelve new power plant cards exclusive for northern europe  again  there are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two regions  on the northern europe side  the seven countries use very different energy sources for their electricity production and the set of power plants you play with is dependent upon which regions are chosen  on the united kingdom and ireland side  players can operate two different networks on these two isles  but  starting the second network is expensive since there is no direct connection between ireland and great britain  additionally  step three starts earlier on this map because this region changed from a resource exporter to an importer in a very short time     this expansion was released at essen       it contains maps for the australian and indian sub continents  the main differences between the australian map and other maps is that there are three networks and the maximum cost of connecting any two cities is    elektros  reducing the overall cost if a player is blocked in  also  uranium power plants are actually turned into uranium mines  reflecting the resource production in australia  where the cost of running the mines is turned upside down and instead creates income in the bureaucracy phase for the owner  in the indian map  power outs can occur and seriously reduce the incomes of fast expanding networks  also  the resource markets are severely reduced     these items are small  single or multiple card promotional items that can be added to supplement the base game     the flux generator is a power plant that can fire any   resources to power   cities     the card is auctioned to the players immediately after it has been drawn  it counts as an additional city for its owner and not as a power plant     the transformer station is a technology card that can be connected to a power plant to supply an additional city     warehouse is a limited edition   card set     you can store up to three resources of any type in the warehouse for future use in your own power plants  stored resources cannot be dumped and must be used in the power plants     the two  event cards  either remove three tokens of the cheapest resource or add three tokens of the most expensive resource from or to the resource market  only one token  if this is uranium   if there is a tie for cheapest or most expensive  resolve in the order coal  oil  garbage  uranium     allows the player to place his house in the player order one space back in every round  allowing the player to bid resources earlier     thanks to the industrial espionage a single player  the last player in every round  gets informations about the topmost card in the power plant draw stack     forces the players to pay taxes for the cash assets once during the game     these titles are stand alone games in the power grid family of games     in power grid  factory manager players own factories and try to earn the most money during the game  to be successful  each player must use his workers to buy the best machines and robots at the market and to run the machines most effectively in his factory  because of increasing energy prices  the players must be careful to check the energy consumption of their factories and to avoid using only energy consuming machines     the first sparks transports the power grid mechanisms into the stone age  the order of phases during a game round  the player order  the technology cards are all similar to the original game     the first sparks is much faster and far more direct  you are immediately part of the action  each turn  each decision is important  as a clan leader you decide on the well being of your clan during the stone age  you need to develop new hunting technologies and get new knowledge   to successfully hunt food or to learn to control fire  with the help of these skills  you will harvest enough food to feed your clan and spread it far enough to reach new hunting areas     martin wallace comments   i cannot say the game is definitively a classic  what i do know is that it still gets played regularly around the u k  games scene  the vast majority of board games get dragged out once or twice and are then chucked to one side to collect dust until either auctioned or hidden in the loft by the better half  power grid has hung around because it has that certain something about it that makes you happy to sit down and play a game
