 the intercloud  is an interconnected global  cloud of clouds    and an extension of the internet  network of networks  on which it is based   the term was first used in the context of cloud computing in      when kevin kelly opined that  eventually we ll have the intercloud  the cloud of clouds    it became popular in early        and has also been used to describe the datacenter of the future      the intercloud scenario is based on the key concept that each single cloud does not have infinite physical resources or ubiquitous geographic footprint  if a cloud saturates the computational and storage resources of its infrastructure  or is requested to use resources in a geography where it has no footprint  it would still be able satisfy such requests for service allocations sent from its clients  the intercloud scenario would address such situations where each cloud would use the computational  storage  or any kind of resource  through semantic resource descriptions  and open federation  of the infrastructures of other clouds  this is analogous to the way the internet works  in that a service provider to which an endpoint is attached  will access or deliver traffic from to source destination addresses outside of its service area by using internet routing protocols with other service providers with whom it has a pre arranged exchange or peering relationship  it is also analogous to the way mobile operators implement roaming and inter carrier interoperability  such forms of cloud exchange  peering  or roaming may introduce new business opportunities among cloud providers if they manage to go beyond the theoretical framework              in july      in japan  an effort called the global inter cloud technology forum  gictf   was launched with the stated goal of  we aim to promote standardization of network protocols and the interfaces through which cloud systems interwork with each other  and to enable the provision of more reliable cloud services than those available today   as of mid      they have over    member companies and have published proposed use cases as well as technical documents     in july      in france the the first ieee international workshop on cloud computing interoperability and services  intercloud         was held bringing researchers together and yielding many published papers  the workshop has become an international research series  with intercloud        held in turkey  intercloud        held in madrid  and intercloud        held in boston     in february      the ieee launched a broad cloud computing initiative ieee cloud computing including a technical standards effort called p       standard for intercloud interoperability and federation  siif     the stated goal of the working group is to produce a standard as such   this standard defines topology  functions  and governance for cloud to cloud interoperability and federation  topological elements include clouds  roots  exchanges  which mediate governance between clouds   and gateways  which mediate data exchange between clouds   functional elements include name spaces  presence  messaging  resource ontologies  including standardized units of measurement   and trust infrastructure  governance elements include registration  geo independence  trust anchor  and potentially compliance and audit  the standard does not address intra cloud  within cloud  operation  as this is cloud implementation specific  nor does it address proprietary hybrid cloud implementations   as of mid      they have over    member companies and have published a working draft         in mid      the nist cloud computing reference architecture was published   fully describing hybrid clouds  cloud brokers  and so on  in late      nist published a whole set of cloud computing technology roadmaps   including referencing the ieee p     approach as an example of a future national global federated cloud architecture     in march       intercloud  made the wired magazine jargon watch list       in june      at the  th international conference on cloud computing  cloud         the ieee announced   an intercloud test bed with stated goal of  the test bed will be a cloud infrastructure comprised of assets from participating universities and industry partners  it will be used to develop and test protocols that will be formalized in the ieee p     interoperability standard      in october      the ieee announced   a global testbed initiative  the    cloud and network service providers  cloud enabling companies  and academic and industry research institutions from the united states  the asia pacific region  and europe  the members have volunteered to provide their own cloud implementations and expertise to a shared testbed environment  they will also collaborate to produce a working prototype and open source cloudos neutral global intercloud  as of      this project is actively proceeding       in late      cisco made their first announcement relating to the intercloud  their product cisco intercloud fabric  icf     allows vm migrations between public and private clouds  cisco went on in january        detailing this hybrid cloud solution  and went so far as to claim that  cisco introduced the concept of the  world of many clouds  two years ago  notably not acknowledging the work that the gictf  nist  or the ieee had done     in      cisco made another announcement   cisco revealed that it  will invest   bn in the next two years to build its expanded cloud business  and that  our cloud will be the world s first truly open  hybrid cloud  the cisco intercloud will be built upon openstack for its open standards based global infrastructure  we plan to support any workload  on any hypervisor and interoperate with any cloud   again assuming all clouds are using cisco s proprietary technology      the intercloud has yetwhen  to show real world demonstration of federation and interoperability  and challenges remain regarding security and trust  governance and legal issues  qos  monitoring  arbitrage  and billing     in october      an open source project called utter io   released   a framework which claims to provide a trusted federated solution using vendor neutral deployments of openstack  the project does revenue sharing with providers through the use of cryptocurrencies and runs at stackmonkey    the company behind the project  as of january      the project ties together clouds from hp  nebula  and auro  a canadian openstack provider         trend micro applied for u s
