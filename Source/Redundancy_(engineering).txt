 in engineering  redundancy is the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the system  usually in the form of a backup or fail safe     in many safety critical systems  such as fly by wire and hydraulic systems in aircraft  some parts of the control system may be triplicated   which is formally termed triple modular redundancy  tmr   an error in one component may then be out voted by the other two  in a triply redundant system  the system has three sub components  all three of which must fail before the system fails  since each one rarely fails  and the sub components are expected to fail independently  the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small  often outweighed by other risk factors  e g   human error  redundancy may also be known by the terms  majority voting systems   or  voting logic       redundancy sometimes produce less  instead of more reliabilityxa    it creates a more complex system which is more prone to various issues  it may lead to human neglectance of duty  and it may lead to higher production demands which are overstressing the system making it less safe              in computer science  there are four major forms of redundancy  these are     a modified form of software redundancy  applied to hardware may be     structures are usually designed with redundant parts as well  ensuring that if one part fails  the entire structure won t collapse  a structure without redundancy is called fracture critical  meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure  bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the silver bridge and the interstate   bridge over the skagit river     the two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and active redundancy  both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity     passive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures  one common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges  this extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse  the extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety     eyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy  vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but depth perception is impaired  hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is impaired  performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur     active redundancy eliminates performance decline by monitoring performance of individual device  and this monitoring is used in voting logic  the voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures components  error detection and correction and the global positioning system  gps  are two examples of active redundancy     electrical power distribution provides an example of active redundancy  several power lines connect each generation facility with customers  each power line includes monitors that detect overload  each power line also includes circuit breakers  the combination of power lines provides excess capacity  circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload  power is redistributed across the remaining lines     charles perrow  author of normal accidents  has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less  not more reliability  this may happen in three ways  first  redundant safety devices result in a more complex system  more prone to errors and accidents  second  redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers  third  redundancy may lead to increased production pressures  resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds  but less safely      voting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system  voting logic often involves computers  but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic  circuit breakers are an example of a form of non computer voting logic     electrical power systems use power scheduling to reconfigure active redundancy  computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost  this prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake     the simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components  primary and alternate  they both run similar software  but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation  the primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is ok  all outputs from the primary stop  including the activity message  when the primary detects a fault  the alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases  errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time  or cause outputs to flutter on and off     a more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more  all perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic  the voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement  and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device s  that disagree  a single fault will not interrupt normal operation  this technique is used with avionics systems  such as those responsible for operation of the space shuttle     each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula      where     this formula assumes independence of failure events  that means that the probability of a component b failing given that a component a has already failed is the same as that of b failing when a has not failed  there are situations where this is unreasonable  such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket  whereby if one socket failed  the other would too     it also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running  if  components are needed for the system to survive  out of   the probability of failure iscitation needed      assuming all components have equal probability    of failure    this model is probably unrealistic in that it assumes that components are not replaced in time when they fail
