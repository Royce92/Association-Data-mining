 a name server is a computer hardware or software server that implements a network service for providing responses to queries against a directory service  it translates an often humanly meaningful  text based identifier to a system internal  often numeric identification or addressing component  this service is performed by the server in response to a service protocol request     an example of a name server is the server component of the domain name system  dns   one of the two principal name spaces of the internet  the most important function of dns servers is the translation  resolution  of human memorable domain names and hostnames into the corresponding numeric internet protocol  ip  addresses  the second principal name space of the internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the internet             the internet maintains two principal namespaces  the domain name hierarchy  and the ip address system   the domain name system maintains the domain namespace and provides translation services between these two namespaces  internet name servers implement the domain name system   the top hierarchy of the domain name system is served by the root name servers maintained by delegation by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  icann   below the root  internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains  administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders  a dns name server is a server that stores the dns records  such as address  a  aaaa  records  name server  ns  records  and mail exchanger  mx  records for a domain name  see also list of dns record types  and responds with answers to queries against its database     authoritative name server is a name server that gives answers in response to questions asked about names in a zone  an authoritative only name server returns answers only to queries about domain names that have been specifically configured by the administrator  name servers can also be configured to give authoritative answers to queries in some zones  while acting as a caching name server for all other zones citation needed    an authoritative name server can either be a primary server  master  or a secondary server  slave   a primary server for a zone is the server that stores the definitive versions of all records in that zone  a secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism to maintain an identical copy of the primary server s database for a zone  examples of such mechanisms include dns zone transfers and file transfer protocols  dns provides a mechanism whereby the primary for a zone can notify all the known secondaries for that zone when the contents of the zone have changed  the contents of a zone are either manually configured by an administrator  or managed using dynamic dns citation needed    every domain name appears in a zone served by one or more authoritative name servers  the fully qualified domain names of the authoritative name servers of a zone are listed in the ns records of that zone  if the server for a zone is not also authoritative for its parent zone  the server for the parent zone must be configured with a delegation for the zone citation needed    when a domain is registered with a domain name registrar  the zone administrator provides the list of name servers  typically at least two  for redundancy   that are authoritative for the zone that contains the domain  the registrar provides the names of these servers to the domain registry for the top level domain containing the zone  the domain registry in turn configures the authoritative name servers for that top level domain with delegations for each server for the zone  if the fully qualified domain name of any name server for a zone appears within that zone  the zone administrator provides ip addresses for that name server  which are installed in the parent zone as glue records  otherwise  the delegation consists of the list of ns records for that zone citation needed    a name server indicates that its response is authoritative by setting the authoritative answer  aa  bit in the response to a query on a name for which it is authoritative  name servers providing answers for which they are not authoritative  for example  name servers for parent zones   do not set the aa bit      if a name server cannot answer a query because it does not contain an entry for the host in its database  it may recursively query name servers higher up in the hierarchy   this is known as a recursive query or recursive lookup  in principle  authoritative name servers suffice for the operation of the internet  however  with only authoritative name servers operating  every dns query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the domain name system and each user system must implement resolver software capable of recursive operation     caching name servers  dns caches  store dns query results for a period of time determined in the configuration  time to live  of each domain name record  dns caches improve the efficiency of the dns by reducing dns traffic across the internet  and by reducing load on authoritative name servers  particularly root name servers  because they can answer questions more quickly  they also increase the performance of end user applications that use the dns  recursive name servers resolve any query they receive  even if they are not authoritative for the question being asked  by consulting the server or servers that are authoritative for the question  caching name servers are often also recursive name servers they perform every step necessary to answer any dns query they receive  to do this the name server queries each authoritative name server in turn  starting from the dns root zone  it continues until it reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name  that server provides the answer to the question  or definitively says it can t be answered  and the caching resolver then returns this response to the client that asked the question  the authority  resolving and caching functions can all be present in a dns server implementation  but this is not required  a dns server can implement any one of these functions alone  without implementing the others  internet service providers typically provide caching resolvers for their customers  in addition  many home networking routers implement caching resolvers to improve efficiency in the local network  some systems utilize nscd   the name service caching daemon     name servers also exist on some microsoft windows networks where one host assumes the role of netbios browse master and performs as a nbns server  small local area networks of windows systems require no central name server  and generally perform name resolution using a broadcast algorithm     the windows internet name service  wins  is a name service that translates netbios names to numerical addresses
