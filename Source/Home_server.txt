 a home server is a server located in a private residence providing services to other devices inside or outside the household through a home network or the internet  such services may include file and printer serving  media center serving  web serving  on the network or internet   web caching  account authentication and backup services  because of the relatively low number of computers on a typical home network  a home server commonly does not require significant computing power and can be implemented with a re purposed  older computer  or a plug computer  an uninterruptible power supply is sometimes used in case of power outages that can possibly corrupt data             home servers often run headless  and can be administered remotely through a command shell  or graphically through a remote desktop system such as rdp  vnc  webmin  apple remote desktop  or many others     some home server operating systems  such as windows home server  include a consumer focused graphical user interface  gui  for setup and configuration that is available on home computers on the home network  and remotely over the internet via remote access   others simply enable users to use native operating system tools for configuration     home servers often act as network attached storage  nas  providing the major benefit that all users  files can be centrally and securely stored  with flexible permissions applied to them  such files can be easily accessed from any other system on the network  provided the correct credentials are supplied  this also applies to shared printers     such files can also be shared over the internet to be accessible from anywhere in the world using remote access     servers running unix or linux with the free samba suite  or certain windows server products   windows home server excluded  can provide domain control  custom logon scripts  and roaming profiles to users of certain versions of windowscitation needed  this allows a user to log on from any machine in the domain and have access to her or his  my documents  and personalized windows and application preferences   multiple accounts on each computer in the home are not needed     home servers are often used to serve multi media content  including photos  music  and video to other devices in the household  and even to the internet  see space shifting  tonido and orb   using standard protocols such as dlna or proprietary systems such as itunes  users can access their media stored on the home server from any room in the house  windows xp media center edition  windows vista  and windows   can act as a home server  supporting a particular type of media serving that streams the interactive user experience to media center extenders including the xbox         windows home server supports media streaming to xbox     and other dlna based media receivers via the built in windows media connect technology  some windows home server device manufacturers  such as hp  extend this functionality with a full dlna implementation such as packetvideo twonkymedia server     there are many open source and fully functional programs for media serving available for linux  linuxmce is one example  which allows other devices to boot off a hard drive image on the server  allowing them to become appliances such as set top boxes  asterisk  xine  mythtv  another media serving solution   videolan  slimserver  dlna  and many other open source projects are fully integrated for a seamless home theater automation telephony experience     on an apple macintosh server  options include itunes  ps  media server  and elgato  additionally  for macs directly connected to tvs  the built in frontrow program or boxee can act as a full featured media center interface     servers are typically always on so the addition of a tv or radio tuner allows recording to be scheduled at any time     some home servers provide remote access to media and entertainment content     a home server can be used to provide remote access into the home from devices on the internet  using remote desktop software and other remote administration software  for example  windows home server provides remote access to files stored on the home server via a web interface as well as remote access to remote desktop sessions on pcs in the house  similarly  tonido provides direct access via a web browser from the internet without requiring any port forwarding or other setup  some enthusiasts often use vpn technologies as well     on a linux server  two popular tools are  among many  vnc and webmin  vnc allows clients to remotely view a server gui desktop as if the user was physically sitting in front of the server  a gui need not be running on the server console for this to occur  there can be multiple  virtual  desktop environments open at the same time  webmin allows users to control many aspects of server configuration and maintenance all from a simple web interface  both can be configured to be accessed from anywhere on the internet     servers can also be accessed remotely using the command line based telnet and ssh protocols     some users choose to run a web server in order to share files easily and publicly  or privately  on the home network   others set up web pages and serve them straight from their home  although this may be in violation of some isps terms of service  sometimes these web servers are run on a nonstandard port in order to avoid the isp s port blocking  example web servers used on home servers include apache and iis     many other web servers are available  see comparison of lightweight web servers  comparison of web servers     some networks have an http proxy which can be used to speed up web access when multiple users visit the same websites  and to get past blocking software while the owner is using the network of some institution that might block certain sites  public proxies are often slow and unreliable and so it is worth the trouble of setting up one s own private proxy     some proxies can be configured to block websites on the local network if it is set up as a transparent proxy     many home servers also run e mail servers that handle e mail for the owner s domain name  the advantages are having much bigger mailboxes and maximum message size than most commercial e mail services  access to the server  since it is on the local network is much faster than using an external service  this also increases security as e mails do not reside on an off site server     home servers are ideal for utilizing the bittorrent protocol for downloading and seeding files as some torrents can take days  or even weeks to complete and perform better on an uninterrupted connection  there are many text based clients such as rtorrent and web based ones such as torrentflux and tonido available for this purpose  bittorrent also makes it easier for those with limited bandwidth to distribute large files over the internet     an unusual service is the gopher protocol  a hypertext document retrieval protocol which pre dated the world wide web and was popular in the early     s  many of the remaining gopher servers are run off home servers utilizing pygopherd and the bucktooth gopher server     home automation requires a device in the home that is available       often such home automation controllers are run on a home server     relatively low cost cctv dvr solutions are available that allow recording of video cameras to a home server for security purposes  the video can then be viewed on pcs or other devices in the house     a series of cheap usb based webcams can be connected to a home server as a makeshift cctv system  optionally these images and video streams can be made available over the internet using standard protocols     home servers can act as a host to family oriented applications such as a family calendar  to do lists  and message boards     because a server is always on  an irc client or im client running on it will be highly available to the internet  this way  the chat client will be able to record activity that occurs even while the user is not at the computer  e g  asleep or at work or school  textual clients such as irssi and tmsnc can be detached using gnu screen for example  and graphical clients such as pidgin can be detached using xmove  quassel provides a specific version for this kind of use  home servers can also be used to run personal xmpp servers and irc servers as these protocols can support a large number of users on very little bandwidth    some multiplayer games such as continuum  tremulous  minecraft  and doom have server software available which users may download and use to run their own private game server  some of these servers are password protected  so only a selected group of people such as clan members or whitelisted players can gain access to the server  others are open for public use and may move to colocation or other forms of paid hosting if they gain a large number of players     home servers often are platforms that enable third party products to be built and added over time  for example  windows home server provides a software development kit   similarly  tonido provides an application platform that can be extended by writing new applications using their sdk     home servers run many different operating systems  enthusiasts who build their own home servers can use whatever os is conveniently available or familiar to them  such as microsoft windows  mac os x  gnu linux  solaris  bsd or plan   from bell labs  many people choose linux because of its lower resource use  and therefore lower system requirements
