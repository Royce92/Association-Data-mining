 the raspberry pi is a series of credit card sized single board computers developed in the uk by the raspberry pi foundation with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools        the original raspberry pi and raspberry pi   are manufactured in several board configurations through licensed manufacturing agreements with newark element    premier farnell   rs components and egoman  these companies sell the raspberry pi online   egoman produces a version for distribution solely in china and taiwan  which can be distinguished from other pis by their red colouring and lack of fcc ce marks  the hardware is the same across all manufacturers     the original raspberry pi is based on the broadcom bcm     system on a chip  soc    which includes an arm    jzf s    xa mhz processor  videocore iv gpu   and was originally shipped with    xa megabytes of ram  later upgraded  models b and b   to    xa mb    the system has secure digital  sd   models a and b  or microsd  models a  and b   sockets for boot media and persistent storage       in       the raspberry pi foundation launched the compute module  which packages a bcm     with    xa mb ram and an emmc flash chip into a module for use as a part of embedded systems       the foundation provides debian and arch linux arm distributions for download    tools are available for python as the main programming language  with support for bbc basic    via the risc os image or the brandy basic clone for linux     c  c    java    perl and ruby       as of    february     update  over five million raspberry pis have been sold    while already the fastest selling british personal computer  it has also shipped the second largest number of units behind the amstrad pcw  the  personal computer word processor   which sold eight million     in early february       the next generation raspberry pi  raspberry pi    was officially announced    the new computer board will initially be available only in one configuration  model b  and features a broadcom bcm     soc  with a quad core arm cortex a  cpu and a videocore iv dual core gpu   xa gb of ram with remaining specifications being similar to those of the previous generation model b   crucially  the raspberry pi   will retain the same us    price point of the model b    with the us    model a remaining on sale         in the above block diagram for model a  b  a   b   model a and a  have the lowest two blocks and the rightmost block missing  note that these three blocks are in a chip that actually contains a three port usb hub  with a usb ethernet adapter connected to one of its ports   in model a and a  the usb port is connected directly to the soc  on model b  the chip contains a five point hub  with four usb ports fed out  instead of the two on model b     the soc used in the first generation raspberry pi is somewhat equivalent to the chip used in older smartphones  such as iphone    g    gs   the raspberry pi is based on the broadcom bcm     system on a chip  soc    which includes an    xa mhz arm    jzf s processor  videocore iv gpu   and ram  it has a level   cache of   xa kb and a level   cache of    xa kb  the level   cache is used primarily by the gpu  the soc is stacked underneath the ram chip  so only its edge is visible     while operating at    xa mhz by default  the first generation raspberry pi provided a real world performance roughly equivalent to      xa gflops      on the cpu level the performance is similar to a    xa mhz pentium ii of            the gpu provides  xa gpixel s or    xa gtexel s of graphics processing or   xa gflops of general purpose computing performance  the graphics capabilities of the raspberry pi are roughly equivalent to the level of performance of the xbox of          the linpack single node compute benchmark results in a mean single precision performance of      xa gflops and a mean double precision performance of      xa gflops for one raspberry pi model b board    a cluster of    raspberry pi model b computers  labeled  iridis pi   achieved a linpack hpl suite result of     xa gflops  n        at    xa watts for c  us             raspberry pi   is much more powerful  while the gpu is identical     the first generation raspberry pi chip operated at    xa mhz by default and did not become hot enough to need a heat sink or special cooling  unless the chip was overclocked  the second generation runs on    xa mhz by default  and also does not become hot enough to need a heatsink or special cooling  again overclocking may heat up the soc more than usual     most raspberry pi chips could be overclocked to    xa mhz and some even higher to     xa mhz  there are reports the second generation can be similarly overclocked  in extreme cases  even to     xa mhz  discarding all safety features and over voltage limitations   in the raspbian linux distro the overclocking options on boot can be done by a software command running  sudo raspi config  without voiding the warranty citation needed in those cases the pi automatically shuts the overclocking down in case the chip reaches   xa  c     xa  f   but it is possible to overrule automatic over voltage and overclocking settings  voiding the warranty   in that case  one can try putting an appropriately sized heatsink on it to keep the chip from heating up far above   xa  c     newer versions of the firmware contain the option to choose between five overclock   turbo   presets that when turned on try to get the most performance out of the soc without impairing the lifetime of the pi  this is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip  and the cpu load  and dynamically adjusting clock speeds and the core voltage  when the demand is low on the cpu  or it is running too hot  the performance is throttled  but if the cpu has much to do  and the chip s temperature is acceptable  performance is temporarily increased  with clock speeds of up to  xa ghz  depending on the individual board  and on which of the turbo settings is used  the five settings are     in the highest  turbo  preset the sdram clock was originally    xa mhz  but this was later changed to    xa mhz because    xa mhz sometimes causes sd card corruption  simultaneously in high mode the core clock speed was lowered from     to    xa mhz  and in medium mode from     to    xa mhz     on the older beta model b boards     xa mb was allocated by default to the gpu  leaving    xa mb for the cpu    on the first    xa mb release model b  and model a   three different splits were possible  the default split was    xa mb  ram for cpu   which should be sufficient for standalone     p video decoding  or for simple  d  but probably not for both together     xa mb was for linux only  with just a     p framebuffer  and was likely to fail for any video or  d     xa mb was for heavy  d  possibly also with video decoding  e g  xbmc     comparatively the nokia     uses    xa mb for the broadcom videocore iv    for the new model b with    xa mb ram initially there were new standard memory split files released  arm   _start elf  arm   _start elf  arm   _start elf  for    xa mb     xa mb and    xa mb cpu ram  and    xa mb     xa mb and   xa mb video ram   but a week or so later the rpf released a new version of start elf that could read a new entry in config txt  gpu_mem xx  and could dynamically assign an amount of ram  from    to    xa mb in  xa mb steps  to the gpu  so the older method of memory splits became obsolete  and a single start elf worked the same for     and    xa mb pis    the second generation has  xa gb of ram     though the model a and a  do not have an  p c   rj     ethernet port  they can be connected to a network using an external user supplied usb ethernet or wi fi adapter  on the model b and b  the ethernet port is provided by a built in usb ethernet adapter     generic usb keyboards and mice are compatible with the raspberry pi       the video controller is capable of standard modern tv resolutions  such as hd and full hd  and higher or lower monitor resolutions and older standard crt tv resolutions  capable of the following          ega          vga          svga           xga              p hdtv           wxga variant           wxga variant            sxga           wxga variant            sxga             uxga            wxga                 p hdtv            wuxga    it can generate    i and    i composite video signals for pal bghid  pal m  pal n  ntsc and ntsc j       the raspberry pi does not come with a real time clock  which means it cannot keep track of the time of day while it is not powered on     as alternatives  a program running on the pi can get the time from a network time server or user input at boot time     a real time clock  such as the ds      with battery backup can be added  often via the i c interface      an additional    gpio are available on the p  pad if the user is willing to make solder connections    location of connectors and ics on original raspberry pi model b    location of connectors and ics on raspberry pi b  rev      and raspberry pi   model b    rpi a   b  and  b gpio j     pin pinout    models a and b have only the first    pins     model b rev   also has a pad p  of   pins offering access to an additional   gpio connections       models a and b provide gpio access to the act status led using gpio     models a  and b  provide gpio access to the act status led using gpio     and the power status led using gpio        the raspberry pi primarily uses linux kernel based operating systems     the arm   chip at the heart of the pi  pre pi    is based on version   of the arm  the current releases of several popular versions of linux  including ubuntu    will not run on the arm    it is not possible to run windows on the original raspberry pi    though the new raspberry pi   will be able to run windows       the raspberry pi   currently only supports ubuntu snappy core  raspbian  openelec and risc os       the install manager for the raspberry pi is noobs  the operating systems included with noobs are     raspberry pi can use a videocore iv gpu via a binary blob  which is loaded into the gpu at boot time from the sd card  and additional software  that initially was closed source     this part of the driver code was later released     however much of the actual driver work is done using the closed source gpu code  application software uses calls to closed source run time libraries  openmax  opengl es or openvg  which in turn calls an open source driver inside the linux kernel  which then calls the closed source videocore iv gpu driver code  the api of the kernel driver is specific for these closed libraries  video applications use openmax   d applications use opengl es and  d applications use openvg which both in turn use egl  openmax and egl use the open source kernel driver in turn        technology writer glyn moody described the project in may      as a  potential bbc micro       not by replacing pc compatible machines but by supplementing them     in march      stephen pritchard echoed the bbc micro successor sentiment in itpro     alex hope  co author of the next gen report  is hopeful that the computer will engage children with the excitement of programming     co author ian livingstone suggested that the bbc could be involved in building support for the device  possibly branding it as the bbc nano    chris williams  writing in the register sees the inclusion of programming languages such as kids ruby  scratch and basic as a  good start  to equip kids with the skills needed in the future   although it remains to be seen how effective their use will be     the centre for computing history strongly supports the raspberry pi project  feeling that it could  usher in a new era      before release  the board was showcased by arm s ceo warren east at an event in cambridge outlining google s ideas to improve uk science and technology education        harry fairhead  however  suggests that more emphasis should be put on improving the educational software available on existing hardware  using tools such as google app inventor to return programming to schools  rather than adding new hardware choices     simon rockman  writing in a zdnet blog  was of the opinion that teens will have  better things to do   despite what happened in the     s        in october       the raspberry pi won t  s innovation of the year award     and futurist mark pesce cited a  borrowed  raspberry pi as the inspiration for his ambient device project moorescloud     in october       the british computer society reacted to the announcement of enhanced specifications by stating   it s definitely something we ll want to sink our teeth into         in february       a switched mode power supply chip  designated u    of the raspberry pi   model b version      the initially released version  was found to be vulnerable to flashes of light     particularly the light from xenon camera flashes and green    and red laser pointers  however  other bright lights  particularly ones that are on continuously  were found to have no effect  the symptom was the raspberry pi   spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip  initially  some users and commenters suspected that the electromagnetic pulse from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer s digital circuitry  but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at the other side of the raspberry pi    both of which did not cause a problem  the problem was narrowed down to the u   chip by covering first the system on a chip  main processor  and then u   with opaque poster mounting compound  light being the sole culprit  instead of emp  was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests     where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes     the u   chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover  i e  a chip scale package or wafer level package   which would  if present  block the light  based on the facts that the chip  like all semiconductors  is light sensitive  photovoltaic effect   that silicon is transparent to infrared light  and that xenon flashes emit more infrared light than laser pointers  therefore requiring more light shielding      it is currently thought that this combination of factors allows the sudden bright infrared light to cause an instability in the output voltage of the power supply  triggering shutdown or restart of the raspberry pi    unofficial workarounds include covering u   with opaque material  such as electrical tape        lacquer  poster mounting compound  or even balled up bread      putting the raspberry pi   in a case     and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash  this issue was not caught before the release of the raspberry pi   because while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference  it is not standard or common practice to test their susceptibility to optical interference        the raspberry pi community was described by jamie ayre of floss software company adacore as one of the most exciting parts of the project     community blogger russell davis said that the community strength allows the foundation to concentrate on documentation and teaching     the community developed a fanzine around the platform called the magpi    which in       was handed over to the raspberry pi foundation by its volunteers to be continued in house     a series of community raspberry jam events have been held across the uk and around the world        as of january     update  enquiries about the board in the united kingdom have been received from schools in both the state and private sectors  with around five times as much interest from the latter  it is hoped that businesses will sponsor purchases for less advantaged schools     the ceo of premier farnell said that the government of a country in the middle east has expressed interest in providing a board to every schoolgirl  in order to enhance her employment prospects           in       the raspberry pi foundation hired a number of its community members including ex teachers and software developers to launch a set of free learning resources for its website     the resources are freely licensed under creative commons  and contributions and collaborations are encouraged on social coding platform github     the foundation also started a teacher training course called picademy with the aim of helping teachers prepare for teaching the new computing curriculum using the raspberry pi in the classroom     the continued professional development course is provided free for teachers and is run by the foundation s education team     raspberry pi model b rev    was rated     by pcmag  while raspberry pi model b rev    was rated       by board db org     in       early concepts of the raspberry pi were based on the atmel atmega    microcontroller  its schematics and pcb layout are publicly available     foundation trustee eben upton assembled a group of teachers  academics and computer enthusiasts to devise a computer to inspire children     the computer is inspired by acorn s bbc micro of             model a  model b and model b  are references to the original models of the british educational bbc micro computer  developed by acorn computers     the first arm prototype version of the computer was mounted in a package the same size as a usb memory stick     it had a usb port on one end and an hdmi port on the other     the foundation s goal was to offer two versions  priced at us    and us     they started accepting orders for the higher priced model b on    february          the lower cost model a on   february          and the even lower cost  us     a  on    november
