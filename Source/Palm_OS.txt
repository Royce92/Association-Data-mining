 palm os  also known as garnet os  is a mobile operating system initially developed by palm  inc   for personal digital assistants  pdas  in       palm os was designed for ease of use with a touchscreen based graphical user interface  it is provided with a suite of basic applications for personal information management  later versions of the os have been extended to support smartphones  several other licensees have manufactured devices powered by palm os     following palm s purchase of the palm trademark  the currently licensed version from access was renamed garnet os  in       access introduced the successor to garnet os  called access linux platform and in       the main licensee of palm os  palm  inc   switched from palm os to webos for their forthcoming devices             palm os was originally developed under the direction of jeff hawkins at palm computing  inc   palm was later acquired by u s  robotics corp    which in turn was later bought by  com   which made the palm subsidiary an independent publicly traded company on march              in january       palm set up a wholly owned subsidiary to develop and license palm os   which was named palmsource  palmsource was then spun off from palm as an independent company on october            palm  then called palmone  became a regular licensee of palm os  no longer in control of the operating system     in september       palmsource announced that it was being acquired by access      in december       palm gained perpetual rights to the palm os source code from access   with this palm can modify the licensed operating system as needed without paying further royalties to access  together with the may      acquisition of full rights to the palm brand name   only palm can publish releases of the operating system under the name  palm os      as a consequence  on january           access announced a name change to their current palm os operating system  now titled garnet os       palm os is a proprietary mobile operating system  designed in      for palm computing  inc  s new pilot pda  it has been implemented on a wide array of mobile devices  including smartphones  wrist watches  handheld gaming consoles  barcode readers and gps devices     palm os versions earlier than     run on motorola freescale dragonball processors  from version     onwards  palm os runs on arm architecture based processors     the key features of the current palm os garnet are     included with the os is also a set of standard applications  with the most relevant ones for the four mentioned pim operations     manufacturers are free to implement different features of the os in their devices or even add new features  this version history describes the officially licensed version from palm palmsource access     all versions prior to palm os   are based on top of the amx         kernel licensed from kadak products ltd  while this kernel is technically capable of multitasking  the  terms and conditions of that license specifically state that palm may not expose the api for creating manipulating tasks within the os        palm os     is the original version present on the pilot      and          version     features the classic pim applications address  date book  memo pad  and to do list  also included is a calculator and the security tool to hide records for private use     palm os     does not differentiate between ram and file system storage  applications are installed directly into ram and executed in place  as no dedicated file system is supported  the operation system depends on constant ram refresh cycles to keep its memory  the os supports    x    monochrome output displays  user input is generated through the graffiti handwriting recognition system or optionally through a virtual keyboard  the system supports data synchronization to another pc via its hotsync technology over a serial interface  the latest bugfix release is version           palm os     was introduced on march          with the palmpilot personal and professional    this version adds tcp ip network  network hotsync  and display backlight support  the last bugfix release is version           two new applications  mail and expense are added  and the standard pim applications have been enhanced     palm os     was introduced on march         with the launch of the palm iii series    this version adds irda infrared and enhanced font support  this version also features updated pim applications and an update to the application launcher     palm os     adds only minor new features  like network hotsync support  it was introduced with the palm iiix and palm v       palm os     adds web clipping support  which is an early palm specific solution to bring web content to a small pda screen  it was introduced with the palm vii organizer     palm os     adds faster hotsync speeds and the ability to do infrared hotsyncing  it was introduced with the palm vx organizer     palm os     is the first version to include native   bit color support  it also adds major convenience features that simplify operation  like a context sensitive icon bar or simpler menu activation  the datebook application is extended with an additional agenda view  this version was first introduced with the palm iiic device    the latest bugfix release is version           as a companion  palm later offered a mobile internet kit software upgrade for palm os        this included palm s web clipping software  multimail  which was later renamed to versamail  version      e mail software  handphone version     sms software  and neomar version     wap browser     palm os     was released with the new palm m    series on march             this version adds a standard interface for external file system access  such as sd cards   external file systems are a radical change to the operating system s previous in place execution  now  application code and data need to be loaded into the device s ram  similar to desktop operating system behavior  a new universal connector with usb support is introduced  the previous optional mobile internet kit is now part of the operating system  version     adds an attention manager to coordinate information from different applications  with several possibilities to get the user s attention  including sound  led blinking or vibration     bit color screens and different time zones are supported  this version also has security and ui enhancements     palm os     is a bugfix release  it was introduced with the launch of the palm i     the later minor os update to version       includes a backport of graffiti   from palm os         palm os     simplified chinese edition is targeted especially for the chinese market with fully simplified chinese support  co released with palm os      no device has been manufactured with this version up to now     palm os    not called      was unveiled by the palm subsidiary palmsource in june        and first implemented on the palm tungsten t  it is the first version to support arm devices and replaced the kadak amx      kernel with the custom mck kernel  named for its developer  that was written in house by palm    applications written for the prior os versions use the older dragonball   k instruction set and are supported via the palm application compatibility environment  pace  emulator in garnet  even with the additional overhead of pace  palm applications usually run faster on arm devices than on previous generation hardware  new software can take advantage of the arm processors with small units of arm code  referred to as armlets     with a more powerful hardware basis  palm os   adds substantial enhancements for multimedia capabilities  high density    x    screens are supported together with a full digital sound playback and record api  palm s separate bluetooth stack is added together with an ieee       b wi fi stack  secure network connections over ssl are supported  the os can be customized with different color schemes     for palm os    palmsource developed and licensed a web browser called palmsource web browser   based on access  netfront     browser     palm os     is mainly a bugfix release  first implemented in the samsung sgh i    in march         it added support for    x    resolutions and introduced the new handwriting input system called graffiti    the new input system was prompted by xerox  lawsuit win against palm  graffiti   is based on jot from cic  the last bugfix release is version           palm os     simplified chinese edition released in september       added full simplified chinese support    further support for qvga resolutions  and a standard api for virtual graffiti called dynamic input area  this version first shipped on lenovo s p    and p    handhelds       palm os garnet       added updated bluetooth libraries and support for multiple screen resolutions ranging from    x    up to    x     it first shipped on the treo     in november       this version also introduced the garnet moniker to distinguish it from palm os cobalt      the last bugfix release is version           garnet os     dropped the palm moniker   and  as of     update  is the current version developed by access  this version is dedicated for use inside of the garnet vm virtual machine     garnet vm was announced and released by access in november        as a core part of the access linux platform and as an emulator allowing nokia internet tablets to run applications written for the garnet os  in june       access release garnet vm version    aka garnet vm beta       b        palm os cobalt       was the designated successor for palm os    it was introduced on february             but is no longer offered by access  see next section   palm os     was renamed to palm os cobalt to make clear that this version was initially not designated to replace palm os    which adopted the name palm os garnet at the same time     palm os cobalt introduced modern operating system features to an embedded operating system based on a new kernel with multitasking and memory protection  a modern multimedia and graphic framework  derived from palm s acquired beos   new security features  and adjustments of the pim file formats to better cooperate with microsoft outlook     palm os cobalt       presented standard communication libraries for telecommunication  wi fi  and bluetooth connectivity  despite other additions  it failed to interest potential licensees to palm os cobalt     several licensees have made custom modifications to the operating system  these are not part of the official licensed version     for several years  palmsource had been attempting to create a modern successor for palm os   and have licensees implement it  although palmsource shipped palm os cobalt     to licensees in january       none adopted it for release devices  palmsource made major improvements to palm os cobalt with the release of palm os cobalt     in september      to please licensees  but even the new version did not lead to production devices     in december       palmsource announced a new os strategy  with the acquisition of the mobile phone software company china mobilesoft  palmsource planned to port palm os on top of a linux kernel  while still offering both palm os garnet and palm os cobalt    this strategy was revised in june       when still no device with palm os cobalt was announced  palmsource announced it was halting all development efforts on any product not directly related to its future linux based platform       with the acquisition of palmsource by access  palm os for linux was changed to become the access linux platform which was first announced in february         the initial versions of the platform and software development kits for the access linux platform were officially released in february         as of january       the access linux platform has yet to ship on devices  however development kits exists and public demonstrations have been showcased     palm  inc  the main licensee of palm os garnet did not license access linux platform for their own devices  instead  palm developed another linux based operating system called palm webos    on february           palm ceo ed colligan said there would be no additional palm os devices  excepting the centro being released to other carriers   palm is focusing on palm webos and windows mobile devices    on april          palm announced the availability of a palm os emulator for its webos       palm os licensees decide which applications are included on their palm os devices  licensees can also customize the applications     notexa   on the newer models  the standard pim apps  address    date book    memo pad  and  todos  have been replaced by their improved counterparts  contacts    calendar   memos  and  tasks      the palm s address program stores contact information  keyed by any of several user definable categories  entries are displayed and sorted in last name  first name order  this can be changed only to company  last name order   there are five slots for phone or e mail  each of which may be designated work  home  fax  other  e mail  main  pager or mobile  the slot designations cannot be changed   the newer contacts app adds the following featuresxa   several addresses    new fieldsxa   website  birthday  more phone numbers  instant messaging with quick connect     calc turns the palm into a standard   function pocket calculator with three shades of purple and blue buttons contrasting with the two red clear buttons  it supports square root and percent keys and has one memory     it also has an option to display a running history of the calculations  much like the paper tape calculators that were once common     date book shows a daily or weekly schedule  or a simple monthly view  the daily schedule has one line per hour  between user selected begin and end times  clicking on an empty line creates a new event  empty lines are crowded out by actual events  whose start and stop times are shown by default bracketed in the left margin  the newer calendar app adds the following featuresxa   new day view  use of categories for events  event location  event can span midnight  event details  birthdays as timeless events  it supports timezone designation for events  a feature lacking in some more recent competitors     an event  or appointment  can be heralded by an alarm  any number of minutes  hours or days before it begins  these alarms sound even when the unit is switched off     appointments can recur in a specified number of days  weeks  months or years and can contain notes     expense tracks common business expenses  no totals are calculated on the palm  the user must sync with a host computer and view the expense data in a worksheet  templates for microsoft excel are supplied      hotsync integrates with the user s pc  usually activated by a press of the physical hotsync button on the palm s cradle  a dock station   this application communicates with various conduits on the desktop pc to install software  backup databases  or merge changes made on the pc or the handheld to both devices  it can communicate with the pc through a physical connection  usb on newer models  although drivers for windows x   based platforms are still unavailable     bit editions work well   bluetooth or irda wireless connections  and direct network connections on devices with networking capability     in addition to the conduits provided by the licensee  developers can create their own conduits for integration with other palm os applications and desktop products  for example  a time tracking package could provide a conduit to communicate information between palm os and windows executables     a backup conduit included with the hotsync software backs up  and restores  if necessary  most of the data on a palm os device  this allows users to hard reset their palm thus clearing all of the data with few noticeable consequences  this also allows users to migrate to new palm devices of the same palm os version  a feature that is helpful to those who lose or damage their device     some models of palm keep their data storage in volatile memory and require constant power to maintain their memory  although these handhelds attempt to save the contents of memory in low battery situations by not  turning on   leaving a  dead  handheld for an extended period of time can cause this reserve power to be used up and the contents of storage memory to be lost  some later palms use nvram or microdrive for storage     memo pad can hold notes of up to       characters each  the newer memos app increases field size from   to    kb  memos are ordered in two ways  alphabetically  and manually  which allows the user to choose the order of the memos   and memos can be grouped in user configurable categories  memo pad is for text only  not for drawings  and text can be entered using the graffiti alphabet  using hardware or software keyboards  or using the  paste  function  when palm devices first became available  some palm users started to create and exchange memo pad documents containing generally useful information  which came to be known as memoware     to do list creates personal reminders and prioritizes the things the user has to do  each to do list item may also have  a priority  categories  to organize and view items in logical groups   attached note  to add more description and clarification of the task  nto do list item can be sorted by  due date  priority or category  the newer tasks app features the following improvementsxa   new interface  repeating tasks  alarms  etc     preferences  also referred to as prefs  shows program files with a special preference panel type which are not shown by the normal launcher  programs can be changed by switching the  appl  type to  panl  and vice versa  palm os contains approximately    preference panels by default and new preference panels can be added just like any other application     preference panels allow users to manage a number of settings  including graffiti settings  sound settings  text shortcuts  network settings and the system time     security  which is a panel on newer palm os devices  is used to configure palm os s security settings  these include the password needed to display hidden records and unlock the device when locked  as well as set up an automatic lockdown time or inactivity threshold  on the pc  only palm desktop honors this password but other pc programs can view everything in other words  all the data protected by this password can be seen by anyone opening the  dat files using a text editor or word processor     starting with palm os version      palm created customized versions of the common pim application  some new features have been added  e g  support for address categories  ringtone associations to users  longer memo texts  etc   they were also renamed to reflect designations from microsoft outlook  thus address became contacts  datebook became calendar  memo pad became memos and to do list became tasks     blazer is a web browser for palm handhelds  the versions     and     run on palm os     or higher handhelds  but they needed a proxy server which has been shut down  so they can no longer be used  version     is used on the treo     smartphone  the current version of blazer is blazer      which is compliant with most major standards  it is generally bundled with newer smartphones and newer palm devices capable of accessing the internet     palm s note pad can be used for quick drawings  with neat handwriting        words will fit on one page  for more text  memo pad is the better choice  there are three sizes of pen width  plus an eraser and a background color change feature in some models  it is possible to draw a very simple map  the more  advanced  desktop version saves the memo pad drawings to the desktop     as of       most new palm handhelds include photos  which creates a digital photo album used to view pictures on a palm os device  as with all the other photo programs  photos can be beamed to other mobile devices  each photo can be labeled and organized into separate photo albums  a slideshow can also be shown for a specific album  and each photo in the album will be shown full screen     photos can be edited with the palm photos pc software  windows only   and when the photos are transferred to the handheld they will contain all changes made to the photo     the palm photos software is available in the zire     tungsten c  tungsten e  tungsten t   tungsten t  and several others     with the support for video  palm photos was later renamed to media and even later to pics  videos     some models feature the ability to make voice recordings which are synced using the voice conduit and can be viewed on a desktop with the voice memo application which is part of the palm desktop suite     there are many successful applications that can be installed on a palm os device  as of       there are more than        third party applications available for the palm os platform    which have various licensing types  including open source  and various closed licensing schemes such as freeware    shareware  and traditional pay up front purchase     palm os garnet applications are primarily coded in c c    two officially supported compilers exist  a commercial product  codewarrior development studio for palm os  and an open source tool chain called prc tools  based on an old version of gcc  codewarrior is criticized for being expensive and is no longer being developed  whereas prc tools lacks several of codewarrior s features  a version of prc tools is included in a free palm os developer suite  pods      onboardc is a c compiler  assembler  linker and programming editor that runs on the palm itself     palm os cobalt applications are also coded in a variation of gcc  but the cobalt compilers have fewer limitations     there are development tools available for palm programming that do not require low level programming in c c    such as pocketc pocketc architect  casl  appforge crossfire  which uses visual basic  visual basic net  or c    handheld basic  pendragon forms  satellite forms and nsbasic palm  visual basic like languages   a java virtual machine was previously available for the palm os platform  however on             palm  inc  announced that it would no longer be available  palm  inc  further said  there is no alternate java virtual machine that we are aware of for palm os     waba and a derivative of it  superwaba  provide a java like virtual machine and programming language  a version of the lua language  called plua  is also available for palm  however  due to the fact that it requires an additional runtime to be installed along with the application  it is only used for mainstream applications by a minority of software companies  quartus forth is an iso ansi standard forth compiler that runs on the palm itself  it also has an interactive console for dynamic development and debugging     three environments allow programming in pascal for palm os  the free pp compiler runs directly on the handheld computer  while pocketstudio is a delphi like ide for windows computers that has a visual form designer and generates prc files for being transferred to handhelds via hotsync  the third option was hspascal  developed by danish developer chriten fihl  based on his experience with the high speed pascal compiler for various    bit computer systems  including the commodore amiga  the full compiler in now available for a donation     as palm has no connection drivers that enable the transfer of data with a server dbms  oracle  mysql  ms sql server   the programmer can use middleware software that enables this connectivity     a roughly r rs compatible implementation of scheme  lispme  provides the palm platform with a gpl licensed onboard lisp repl with some palm os specific adaptations  but although it is functionally a compiler it does not produce code that operates outside the development environment  so its use is restricted to prototyping     a free development tool  lafac  works directly on the palm device  using the memo pad for source code editing  and provides support for a limited subset of c  pascal  and basic     palm os has been involved in various lawsuits over the years
