 fog computing or fog networking is an architecture that uses one or a collaborative multitude of end user clients or near user edge devices to carry out a substantial amount of storage  rather than stored primarily in cloud data centers   communication  rather than routed over the internet backbone   and control  configuration  measurement and management  rather than controlled primarily by network gateways such as those in the lte  telecommunication  core      fog networking consists of a control plane and a data plane  for example  on the data plane  fog computing enables computing services reside at the edge of the network as opposed to servers in a data center  compared to cloud computing  fog computing emphasizes proximity to end users and client objectives  dense geographical distribution and local resource pooling  latency reduction for quality of service  qos  and edge analytics stream mining  resulting in superior user experience  and redundancy in case of failure           fog networking supports the internet of things  iot   in which most of the devices that we use on a daily basis will be connected to each other  examples include our phones  wearable health monitoring devices  connected vehicle and augmented reality using devices such as the google glass
