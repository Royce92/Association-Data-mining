 a monopoly  from greek monos        alone or single    polein         to sell   exists when a specific person or enterprise is the only supplier of a particular commodity  this contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity s control of a market to purchase a good or service  and with oligopoly which consists of a few entities dominating an industry    monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service  a lack of viable substitute goods  and the existence of a high monopoly price well above the firm s marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit   the verb  monopolise  refers to the process by which a company gains the ability to raise prices or exclude competitors  in economics  a monopoly is a single seller  in law  a monopoly is a business entity that has significant market power  that is  the power to charge overly high prices   although monopolies may be big businesses  size is not a characteristic of a monopoly  a small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry  or market       a monopoly is distinguished from a monopsony  in which there is only one buyer of a product or service  a monopoly may also have monopsony control of a sector of a market  likewise  a monopoly should be distinguished from a cartel  a form of oligopoly   in which several providers act together to coordinate services  prices or sale of goods  monopolies  monopsonies and oligopolies are all situations such that one or a few of the entities have market power and therefore interact with their customers  monopoly   suppliers  monopsony  and the other companies  oligopoly  in ways that leave market interactions distorted citation needed    monopolies can be established by a government  form naturally  or form by integration     in many jurisdictions  competition laws restrict monopolies  holding a dominant position or a monopoly of a market is often not illegal in itself  however certain categories of behavior can be considered abusive and therefore incur legal sanctions when business is dominant  a government granted monopoly or legal monopoly  by contrast  is sanctioned by the state  often to provide an incentive to invest in a risky venture or enrich a domestic interest group  patents  copyright  and trademarks are sometimes used as examples of government granted monopolies  the government may also reserve the venture for itself  thus forming a government monopoly citation needed            in economics  the idea of monopoly will be important for the study of management structures  which directly concerns normative aspects of economic competition  and provides the basis for topics such as industrial organization and economics of regulation  there are four basic types of market structures by traditional economic analysis  perfect competition  monopolistic competition  oligopoly and monopoly  a monopoly is a structure in which a single supplier produces and sells a given product  if there is a single seller in a certain industry and there are not any close substitutes for the product  then the market structure is that of a  pure monopoly   sometimes  there are many sellers in an industry and or there exist many close substitutes for the goods being produced  but nevertheless companies retain some market power  this is termed monopolistic competition  whereas in oligopoly the companies interact strategically     in general  the main results from this theory compare price fixing methods across market structures  analyze the effect of a certain structure on welfare  and vary technological demand assumptions in order to assess the consequences for an abstract model of society  most economic textbooks follow the practice of carefully explaining the perfect competition model  mainly because of its usefulness to understand  departures  from it  the so called imperfect competition models      the boundaries of what constitutes a market and what doesn t are relevant distinctions to make in economic analysis  in a general equilibrium context  a good is a specific concept entangling geographical and time related characteristics  grapes sold during october      in moscow is a different good from grapes sold during october      in new york   most studies of market structure relax a little their definition of a good  allowing for more flexibility at the identification of substitute goods  therefore  one can find an economic analysis of the market of grapes in russia  for example  which is not a market in the strict sense of general equilibrium theory monopoly citation needed    monopolies derive their market power from barriers to entry   circumstances that prevent or greatly impede a potential competitor s ability to compete in a market  there are three major types of barriers to entry  economic  legal and deliberate      in addition to barriers to entry and competition  barriers to exit may be a source of market power  barriers to exit are market conditions that make it difficult or expensive for a company to end its involvement with a market  great liquidation costs are a primary barrier for exiting    market exit and shutdown are separate events  the decision whether to shut down or operate is not affected by exit barriers  a company will shut down if price falls below minimum average variable costs     while monopoly and perfect competition mark the extremes of market structures   there is some similarity  the cost functions are the same    both monopolies and perfectly competitive  pc  companies minimize cost and maximize profit  the shutdown decisions are the same  both are assumed to have perfectly competitive factors markets  there are distinctions  some of the more important of which are as follows     the most significant distinction between a pc company and a monopoly is that the monopoly has a downward sloping demand curve rather than the  perceived  perfectly elastic curve of the pc company    practically all the variations mentioned above relate to this fact  if there is a downward sloping demand curve then by necessity there is a distinct marginal revenue curve  the implications of this fact are best made manifest with a linear demand curve  assume that the inverse demand curve is of the form x   a   by  then the total revenue curve is tr   ay   by  and the marginal revenue curve is thus mr   a    by  from this several things are evident  first the marginal revenue curve has the same y intercept as the inverse demand curve  second the slope of the marginal revenue curve is twice that of the inverse demand curve  third the x intercept of the marginal revenue curve is half that of the inverse demand curve  what is not quite so evident is that the marginal revenue curve is below the inverse demand curve at all points    since all companies maximise profits by equating mr and mc it must be the case that at the profit maximizing quantity mr and mc are less than price  which further implies that a monopoly produces less quantity at a higher price than if the market were perfectly competitive     the fact that a monopoly has a downward sloping demand curve means that the relationship between total revenue and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies    total revenue equals price times quantity  a competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that total revenue is proportional to output    thus the total revenue curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price    a competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price  for a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price  thus the total revenue curve for a monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until total revenue is again zero    total revenue has its maximum value when the slope of the total revenue function is zero  the slope of the total revenue function is marginal revenue  so the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when mr      for example assume that the monopoly s demand function is p         q  the total revenue function would be tr     q    q  and marginal revenue would be       q  setting marginal revenue equal to zero we have    so the revenue maximizing quantity for the monopoly is      units and the revenue maximizing price is        a company with a monopoly does not experience price pressure from competitors  although it may experience pricing pressure from potential competition  if a company increases prices too much  then others may enter the market if they are able to provide the same good  or a substitute  at a lesser price    the idea that monopolies in markets with easy entry need not be regulated against is known as the  revolution in monopoly theory        a monopolist can extract only one premium clarification needed and getting into complementary markets does not pay  that is  the total profits a monopolist could earn if it sought to leverage its monopoly in one market by monopolizing a complementary market are equal to the extra profits it could earn anyway by charging more for the monopoly product itself  however  the one monopoly profit theorem is not true if customers in the monopoly good are stranded or poorly informed  or if the tied good has high fixed costs     a pure monopoly has the same economic rationality of perfectly competitive companies  i e  to optimise a profit function given some constraints  by the assumptions of increasing marginal costs  exogenous inputs  prices  and control concentrated on a single agent or entrepreneur  the optimal decision is to equate the marginal cost and marginal revenue of production  nonetheless  a pure monopoly can   unlike a competitive company   alter the market price for its own convenience  a decrease of production results in a higher price  in the economics  jargon  it is said that pure monopolies have  a downward sloping demand   an important consequence of such behaviour is worth noticing  typically a monopoly selects a higher price and lesser quantity of output than a price taking company  again  less is available at a higher price       a monopoly chooses that price that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost  the basic markup rule can be expressed as  p   mc  p     ped    the markup rules indicate that the ratio between profit margin and the price is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand    the implication of the rule is that the more elastic the demand for the product the less pricing power the monopoly has     market power is the ability to increase the product s price above marginal cost without losing all customers    perfectly competitive  pc  companies have zero market power when it comes to setting prices  all companies of a pc market are price takers  the price is set by the interaction of demand and supply at the market or aggregate level  individual companies simply take the price determined by the market and produce that quantity of output that maximizes the company s profits  if a pc company attempted to increase prices above the market level all its customers would abandon the company and purchase at the market price from other companies  a monopoly has considerable although not unlimited market power  a monopoly has the power to set prices or quantities although not both    a monopoly is a price maker    the monopoly is the market   and prices are set by the monopolist based on his circumstances and not the interaction of demand and supply  the two primary factors determining monopoly market power are the company s demand curve and its cost structure       market power is the ability to affect the terms and conditions of exchange so that the price of a product is set by a single company  price is not imposed by the market as in perfect competition       although a monopoly s market power is great it is still limited by the demand side of the market  a monopoly has a negatively sloped demand curve  not a perfectly inelastic curve  consequently  any price increase will result in the loss of some customers     price discrimination allows a monopolist to increase its profit by charging higher prices for identical goods to those who are willing or able to pay more      for example  most economic textbooks cost more in the united states than in developing countries like ethiopia  in this case  the publisher is using its government granted copyright monopoly to price discriminate between the generally wealthier american economics students and the generally poorer ethiopian economics students  similarly  most patented medications cost more in the u s  than in other countries with a  presumed  poorer customer base  typically  a high general price is listed  and various market segments get varying discounts  this is an example of framing to make the process of charging some people higher prices more socially acceptable citation needed perfect price discrimination would allow the monopolist to charge each customer the exact maximum amount he would be willing to pay  this would allow the monopolist to extract all the consumer surplus of the market  while such perfect price discrimination is a theoretical construct  advances in information technology and micromarketing may bring it closer to the realm of possibility    it is important to realize that partial price discrimination can cause some customers who are inappropriately pooled with high price customers to be excluded from the market  for example  a poor student in the u s  might be excluded from purchasing an economics textbook at the u s  price  which the student may have been able to purchase at the ethiopian price   similarly  a wealthy student in ethiopia may be able to or willing to buy at the u s  price  though naturally would hide such a fact from the monopolist so as to pay the reduced third world price  these are deadweight losses and decrease a monopolist s profits  as such  monopolists have substantial economic interest in improving their market information and market segmenting citation needed    there is important information for one to remember when considering the monopoly model diagram  and its associated conclusions  displayed here  the result that monopoly prices are higher  and production output lesser  than a competitive company follow from a requirement that the monopoly not charge different prices for different customers  that is  the monopoly is restricted from engaging in price discrimination  this is termed first degree price discrimination  such that all customers are charged the same amount   if the monopoly were permitted to charge individualised prices  this is termed third degree price discrimination   the quantity produced  and the price charged to the marginal customer  would be identical to that of a competitive company  thus eliminating the deadweight loss  however  all gains from trade  social welfare  would accrue to the monopolist and none to the consumer  in essence  every consumer would be indifferent between     going completely without the product or service and     being able to purchase it from the monopolist citation needed    as long as the price elasticity of demand for most customers is less than one in absolute value  it is advantageous for a company to increase its prices  it receives more money for fewer goods  with a price increase  price elasticity tends to increase  and in the optimum case above it will be greater than one for most customers citation needed    a company maximizes profit by selling where marginal revenue equals marginal cost  a company that does not engage in price discrimination will charge the profit maximizing price  p   to all its customers  in such circumstances there are customers who would be willing to pay a higher price than p  and those who will not pay p  but would buy at a lower price  a price discrimination strategy is to charge less price sensitive buyers a higher price and the more price sensitive buyers a lower price    thus additional revenue is generated from two sources  the basic problem is to identify customers by their willingness to pay     the purpose of price discrimination is to transfer consumer surplus to the producer    consumer surplus is the difference between the value of a good to a consumer and the price the consumer must pay in the market to purchase it    price discrimination is not limited to monopolies     market power is a company s ability to increase prices without losing all its customers  any company that has market power can engage in price discrimination  perfect competition is the only market form in which price discrimination would be impossible  a perfectly competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve and has zero market power              there are three forms of price discrimination  first degree price discrimination charges each consumer the maximum price the consumer is willing to pay  second degree price discrimination involves quantity discounts  third degree price discrimination involves grouping consumers according to willingness to pay as measured by their price elasticities of demand and charging each group a different price  third degree price discrimination is the most prevalent type citation needed    there are three conditions that must be present for a company to engage in successful price discrimination  first  the company must have market power    second  the company must be able to sort customers according to their willingness to pay for the good    third  the firm must be able to prevent resell     a company must have some degree of market power to practice price discrimination  without market power a company cannot charge more than the market price    any market structure characterized by a downward sloping demand curve has market power   monopoly  monopolistic competition and oligopoly    the only market structure that has no market power is perfect competition       a company wishing to practice price discrimination must be able to prevent middlemen or brokers from acquiring the consumer surplus for themselves  the company accomplishes this by preventing or limiting resale  many methods are used to prevent resale  for example persons are required to show photographic identification and a boarding pass before boarding an airplane  most travelers assume that this practice is strictly a matter of security  however  a primary purpose in requesting photographic identification is to confirm that the ticket purchaser is the person about to board the airplane and not someone who has repurchased the ticket from a discount buyer citation needed    the inability to prevent resale is the largest obstacle to successful price discrimination    companies have however developed numerous methods to prevent resale  for example  universities require that students show identification before entering sporting events  governments may make it illegal to resale tickets or products  in boston  red sox baseball tickets can only be resold legally to the team     the three basic forms of price discrimination are first  second and third degree price discrimination  in first degree price discrimination the company charges the maximum price each customer is willing to pay  the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a unit of the good is the reservation price  thus for each unit the seller tries to set the price equal to the consumer s reservation price    direct information about a consumer s willingness to pay is rarely available  sellers tend to rely on secondary information such as where a person lives  postal codes   for example  catalog retailers can use mail high priced catalogs to high income postal codes      first degree price discrimination most frequently occurs in regard to professional services or in transactions involving direct buyer seller negotiations  for example  an accountant who has prepared a consumer s tax return has information that can be used to charge customers based on an estimate of their ability to pay       in second degree price discrimination or quantity discrimination customers are charged different prices based on how much they buy  there is a single price schedule for all consumers but the prices vary depending on the quantity of the good bought    the theory of second degree price discrimination is a consumer is willing to buy only a certain quantity of a good at a given price  companies know that consumer s willingness to buy decreases as more units are purchased  the task for the seller is to identify these price points and to reduce the price once one is reached in the hope that a reduced price will trigger additional purchases from the consumer  for example  sell in unit blocks rather than individual units     in third degree price discrimination or multi market price discrimination    the seller divides the consumers into different groups according to their willingness to pay as measured by their price elasticity of demand  each group of consumers effectively becomes a separate market with its own demand curve and marginal revenue curve    the firm then attempts to maximize profits in each segment by equating mr and mc        generally the company charges a higher price to the group with a more price inelastic demand and a relatively lesser price to the group with a more elastic demand    examples of third degree price discrimination abound  airlines charge higher prices to business travelers than to vacation travelers  the reasoning is that the demand curve for a vacation traveler is relatively elastic while the demand curve for a business traveler is relatively inelastic  any determinant of price elasticity of demand can be used to segment markets  for example  seniors have a more elastic demand for movies than do young adults because they generally have more free time  thus theaters will offer discount tickets to seniors       assume that by a uniform pricing system the monopolist would sell five units at a price of     per unit  assume that his marginal cost is    per unit  total revenue would be      total costs would be     and profits would be      if the monopolist practiced price discrimination he would sell the first unit for     the second unit for     and so on  total revenue would be       his total cost would be     and his profit would be            several things are worth noting  the monopolist acquires all the consumer surplus and eliminates practically all the deadweight loss because he is willing to sell to anyone who is willing to pay at least the marginal cost    thus the price discrimination promotes efficiency  secondly  by the pricing scheme price   average revenue and equals marginal revenue  that is the monopolist behaving like a perfectly competitive company    thirdly  the discriminating monopolist produces a larger quantity than the monopolist operating by a uniform pricing scheme       successful price discrimination requires that companies separate consumers according to their willingness to buy  determining a customer s willingness to buy a good is difficult  asking consumers directly is fruitless  consumers don t know  and to the extent they do they are reluctant to share that information with marketers  the two main methods for determining willingness to buy are observation of personal characteristics and consumer actions  as noted information about where a person lives  postal codes   how the person dresses  what kind of car he or she drives  occupation  and income and spending patterns can be helpful in classifying citation needed    the price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be got  the natural price  or the price of free competition  on the contrary  is the lowest which can be taken  not upon every occasion indeed  but for any considerable time together  the one is upon every occasion the highest which can be squeezed out of the buyers  or which it is supposed they will consent to give  the other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly afford to take  and at the same time continue their business             monopoly  besides  is a great enemy to good management             adam smith         the wealth of nations    according to the standard model  in which a monopolist sets a single price for all consumers  the monopolist will sell a lesser quantity of goods at a higher price than would companies by perfect competition  because the monopolist ultimately forgoes transactions with consumers who value the product or service more than its cost  monopoly pricing creates a deadweight loss referring to potential gains that went neither to the monopolist nor to consumers  given the presence of this deadweight loss  the combined surplus  or wealth  for the monopolist and consumers is necessarily less than the total surplus obtained by consumers by perfect competition  where efficiency is defined by the total gains from trade  the monopoly setting is less efficient than perfect competition citation needed    it is often argued that monopolies tend to become less efficient and less innovative over time  becoming  complacent   because they do not have to be efficient or innovative to compete in the marketplace  sometimes this very loss of psychological efficiency can increase a potential competitor s value enough to overcome market entry barriers  or provide incentive for research and investment into new alternatives  the theory of contestable markets argues that in some circumstances  private  monopolies are forced to behave as if there were competition because of the risk of losing their monopoly to new entrants  this is likely to happen when a market s barriers to entry are low  it might also be because of the availability in the longer term of substitutes in other markets  for example  a canal monopoly  while worth a great deal during the late   th century united kingdom  was worth much less during the late   th century because of the introduction of railways as a substitute citation needed    a natural monopoly is an organization that experiences increasing returns to scale over the relevant range of output and relatively high fixed costs    a natural monopoly occurs where the average cost of production  declines throughout the relevant range of product demand   the relevant range of product demand is where the average cost curve is below the demand curve    when this situation occurs  it is always cheaper for one large company to supply the market than multiple smaller companies  in fact  absent government intervention in such markets  will naturally evolve into a monopoly  an early market entrant that takes advantage of the cost structure and can expand rapidly can exclude smaller companies from entering and can drive or buy out other companies  a natural monopoly suffers from the same inefficiencies as any other monopoly  left to its own devices  a profit seeking natural monopoly will produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs  regulation of natural monopolies is problematic citation needed fragmenting such monopolies is by definition inefficient  the most frequently used methods dealing with natural monopolies are government regulations and public ownership  government regulation generally consists of regulatory commissions charged with the principal duty of setting prices       to reduce prices and increase output  regulators often use average cost pricing  by average cost pricing  the price and quantity are determined by the intersection of the average cost curve and the demand curve    this pricing scheme eliminates any positive economic profits since price equals average cost  average cost pricing is not perfect  regulators must estimate average costs  companies have a reduced incentive to lower costs  regulation of this type has not been limited to natural monopolies    average cost pricing does also have some disadvantages  by setting price equal to the intersection of the demand curve and the average total cost curve  the firm s output is allocatively inefficient as the price exceeds the marginal cost  which is the output quantity for a perfectly competitive and allocatively efficient market      a government granted monopoly  also called a  de jure monopoly   is a form of coercive monopoly by which a government grants exclusive privilege to a private individual or company to be the sole provider of a commodity  potential competitors are excluded from the market by law  regulation  or other mechanisms of government enforcement citation needed    a monopolist should shut down when price is less than average variable cost for every output level     in other words where the demand curve is entirely below the average variable cost curve    under these circumstances at the profit maximum level of output  mr   mc  average revenue would be less than average variable costs and the monopolists would be better off shutting down in the short term       when monopolies are not ended by the open market  sometimes a government will either regulate the monopoly  convert it into a publicly owned monopoly environment  or forcibly fragment it  see antitrust law and trust busting   public utilities  often being naturally efficient with only one operator and therefore less susceptible to efficient breakup  are often strongly regulated or publicly owned  american telephone   telegraph  at t  and standard oil are debatable examples of the breakup of a private monopoly by government  when at t  a monopoly previously protected by force of law  was broken up into various components in       mci  sprint  and other companies were able to compete effectively in the long distance phone market citation needed    the existence of a very high market share does not always mean consumers are paying excessive prices since the threat of new entrants to the market can restrain a high market share company s price increases  competition law does not make merely having a monopoly illegal  but rather abusing the power a monopoly may confer  for instance through exclusionary practices  i e  pricing high just because you are the only one around   it may also be noted that it is illegal to try to obtain a monopoly  by practices of buying out the competition  or equal practices  if one occurs naturally  such as a competitor going out of business  or lack of competition  it is not illegal until such time as the monopoly holder abuses the power     first it is necessary to determine whether a company is dominant  or whether it behaves  to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors  customers and ultimately of its consumer     as with collusive conduct  market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the company and product in question is sold  the herfindahl hirschman index  hhi  is sometimes used to assess how competitive an industry is    in the us  the merger guidelines state that a post merger hhi below      is viewed as unconcentrated while hhis above that will provoke further review       by european union law  very large market shares raise a presumption that a company is dominant    which may be rebuttable    if a company has a dominant position  then there is  a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market     the lowest yet market share of a company considered  dominant  in the eu was             certain categories of abusive conduct are usually prohibited by a country s legislation    the main recognised categories are     despite wide agreement that the above constitute abusive practices  there is some debate about whether there needs to be a causal connection between the dominant position of a company and its actual abusive conduct  furthermore  there has been some consideration of what happens when a company merely attempts to abuse its dominant position     the term  monopoly  first appears in aristotle s politics  aristotle describes thales of miletus s cornering of the market in olive presses as a monopoly                      the meaning and understanding of the english word  monopoly  has changed over the years       vending of common salt  sodium chloride  was historically a natural monopoly  until recently  a combination of strong sunshine and low humidity or an extension of peat marshes was necessary for producing salt from the sea  the most plentiful source  changing sea levels periodically caused salt  famines  and communities were forced to depend upon those who controlled the scarce inland mines and salt springs  which were often in hostile areas  e g  the sahara desert  requiring well organised security for transport  storage  and distribution     the salt commission was a legal monopoly in china  formed in      the commission controlled salt production and sales in order to raise tax revenue for the tang dynasty     the  gabelle  was a notoriously high tax levied upon salt in the kingdom of france  the much hated levy had a role in the beginning of the french revolution  when strict legal controls specified who was allowed to sell and distribute salt  first instituted in       the gabelle was not permanently abolished until            robin gollan argues in the coalminers

management of coal companies agreeing to fix a minimum price for sale at dock  this collusion was known as  the vend   the vend ended and was reformed repeatedly during the late   th century  ending

of price fixing in the diamond trade in the     s  de beers is well known for its monopoloid practices throughout the   th century  whereby it used its dominant position to manipulate the international diamond market  the company used several methods to exercise this control over the market  firstly  it convinced independent producers to join its single channel monopoly  it flooded the market with diamonds similar to those of producers who refused to join the cartel  and lastly  it purchased and stockpiled diamonds produced by other manufacturers in order to control prices through limiting supply     in       the de beers business model changed due to factors such as the decision by producers in russia  canada and australia to distribute diamonds outside the de beers channel  as well as rising awareness of blood diamonds that forced de beers to  avoid the risk of bad publicity  by limiting sales to its own mined products  de beers  market share by value fell from as high as     in the     s to less than     in       having resulted in a more fragmented diamond market with more transparency and greater liquidity     in november      the oppenheimer family announced its
