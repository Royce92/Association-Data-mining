 the disk controller is the circuit which enables the cpu to communicate with a hard disk  floppy disk or other kind of disk drive     early disk controllers were identified by their storage methods and data encoding  they were typically implemented on a separate controller card  modified frequency modulation  mfm  controllers were the most common type in small computers  used for both floppy disk and hard disk drives  run length limited  rll  controllers used data compression to increase storage capacity by about      priam created a proprietary storage algorithm that could double the disk storage  shugart associates systems interface  sasi  was a predecessor to scsi     modern disk controllers are integrated into the disk drive  for example  disks called  scsi disks  have built in scsi controllers  in the past  before most scsi controller functionality was implemented in a single chip  separate scsi controllers interfaced disks to the scsi bus     the most common types of interfaces provided nowadays by disk controllers are pata  ide  and serial ata for home use  high end disks use scsi  fibre channel or serial attached scsi  disk controllers can also control the timing of access to flash memory which is not mechanical in nature  i e  no physical disk      the correct term for the component that allows a computer to talk to a peripheral bus is host adapter or host bus adapter  hba   on the other hand  a disk controller allows a disk to talk to the same bus  those two are often confused  especially in the pc world  in fact signals read by a disk read and write head are converted by a disk controller  then transmitted over the peripheral bus  then converted again by the host adapter into the suitable format for the motherboard s bus  and then read by the cpu     sometimes there may be yet another controller between a host adapter and a disk controller   a disk array controller that allows hardware raid to be formed  sometimes it may be even physically integrated with an hba  but it performs different functions     this article is based on material taken from the free on line dictionary of computing prior to   november      and incorporated under the  relicensing  terms of the gfdl  version     or later
