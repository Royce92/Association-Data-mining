 a computer appliance is generally a separate and discrete hardware device with integrated software  firmware   specifically designed to provide a specific computing resource  these devices became known as  appliances  because of their similarity to home appliances  which are generally  closed and sealed    not serviceable by the owner  the hardware and software are pre integrated and pre configured before delivery to customer  to provide a  turn key  solution to a particular problem  unlike general purpose computers  appliances are generally not designed to allow the customers to change the software  including the underlying operating system   or to flexibly reconfigure the hardware     another form of appliance is the virtual appliance  which has similar functionality to a dedicated hardware appliance  but is distributed as a software virtual machine image for a hypervisor equipped device             traditionally  software applications run on top of a general purpose operating system  which uses the hardware resources of the computer  primarily memory  disk storage  processing power  and networking bandwidth  to meet the computing needs of the user  the main issue with the traditional model is related to complexity  it is complex to integrate the operating system and applications with a hardware platform  and complex to support it afterwards     by tightly constraining the variations of the hardware and software  the appliance becomes easily deployable  and can be used without nearly as wide  or deep  it knowledge  additionally  when problems and errors appear  the supporting staff very rarely needs to explore them deeply to understand the matter thoroughly  the staff needs merely training on the appliance management software to be able to resolve most of problems     in all forms of the computer appliance model  customers benefit from easy operations  the appliance has exactly one combination of hardware and operating system and application software  which has been pre installed at the factory  this prevents customers from needing to perform complex integration work  and dramatically simplifies troubleshooting  in fact  this  turnkey operation  characteristic is the driving benefit that customers seek when purchasing appliances     to be considered an appliance  the  hardware  device needs to be integrated with software  and both are supplied as a package citation needed this distinguishes appliances from  home grown  solutions  or solutions requiring complex implementations by integrators or value added resellers  vars      the appliance approach helps to decouple the various systems and applications  for example in the data center  once a resource is decoupled  in theory it can be also centralized to become shared among many systems  centrally managed and optimized  all without requiring changes to any other system     the majorcitation needed disadvantage of deploying a computer appliance is that since they are designed to supply a specific resource  they most often include a customized operating system running over specialized hardware  neither of which are likely to be compatible with the other systems previously deployed  customers lose flexibility     the variety of computer appliances reflects the wide range of computing resources they provide to applications  some examples     aside from its deployment within data centers  many computer appliances are directly used by the general public  these include citation needed    the world of industrial automation has been rich in appliances  these appliances have been hardened to withstand temperature and vibration extremes  these appliances are also highly configurable  enabling customization to meet a wide variety of applications  the key benefits of an appliance in automation are     types of automation appliances citation needed    there are several design patterns adopted by computer appliance vendors  a few of which are shown below  since the whole concept of an appliance rests on keeping such implementation details away from the end user  it is difficult to match these patterns to specific appliances  particularly since they can and do change without affecting external capabilities or performance     sometimes  these techniques are mixed  for example  a vpn appliance might contain a limited access software firewall running on linux  with an encryption asic to speed up vpn access     some computer appliances use solid state storage  while others use a hard drive to load an operating system  again  the two methods might be mixed an asic print server might allow an optional hard drive for job queueing  or a linux based device may encode linux in firmware  so that a hard drive is not needed to load the operating system
