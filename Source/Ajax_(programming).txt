 ajax  also ajax    e d  ks   short for asynchronous javascript and xml     is a group of interrelated web development techniques used on the client side to create asynchronous web applications  with ajax  web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously  in the background  without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page  data can be retrieved using the xmlhttprequest object  despite the name  the use of xml is not required  json is often used in the ajaj variant   and the requests do not need to be asynchronous      ajax is not a single technology  but a group of technologies  html and css can be used in combination to mark up and style information  the dom is accessed with javascript to dynamically display   and allow the user to interact with   the information presented  javascript and the xmlhttprequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server to avoid full page reloads             in the early     s  most web sites were based on complete html pages  each user action required that a complete page be loaded from the server  this process was inefficient  as reflected by the user experience  all page content disappeared  then reappeared  each time the browser reloaded a page because of a partial change  all of the content had to be re sent  even though only some of the information had changed  this placed additional load on the server and used excessive bandwidth     in       the iframe tag was introduced by internet explorer to load or to fetch content asynchronously     in       microsoft outlook web app team implemented the first component xmlhttp by client script     in       microsoft used its iframe technology to dynamically update the news stories and stock quotes on the default page for internet explorer   and created the xmlhttp activex control in internet explorer    which was later adopted by mozilla  safari  opera and other browsers as the xmlhttprequest javascript object   microsoft has adopted the native xmlhttprequest model as of internet explorer    though the activex version is still supported  the utility of background http requests to the server and asynchronous web technologies remained fairly obscure until it started appearing in full scale online applications such as outlook web app         and oddpost            google made a wide deployment of standards compliant  cross browser ajax with gmail        and google maps          in october      kayak com s public beta release was among the first large scale e commerce uses of what their developers at that time called  the xml http thing       the term  ajax  was publicly stated on    february      by jesse james garrett in an article titled  ajax  a new approach to web applications   based on techniques used on google pages      on   april       the world wide web consortium  w c  released the first draft specification for the xmlhttprequest object in an attempt to create an official web standard      the term ajax has come to represent a broad group of web technologies that can be used to implement a web application that communicates with a server in the background  without interfering with the current state of the page  in the article that coined the term ajax   jesse james garrett explained that the following technologies are incorporated     since then  however  there have been a number of developments in the technologies used in an ajax application  and the definition of the term ajax  xml is not required for data interchange and  therefore  xslt is not required for the manipulation of data  javascript object notation  json  is often used as an alternative format for data interchange    although other formats such as preformatted html or plain text can also be used       asynchronous html and http  ahah  involves using xmlhttprequest to retrieve  x html fragments  which are then inserted directly into the web page     here is an example of a simple ajax request using the get method  written in javascript     get ajax data js     send ajax data php     this example uses the popular javascript library jquery  to do the same thing as the example above
