 reliability  availability  and serviceability  ras  is a computer hardware engineering term  the phrase was originally used by ibm as a term to describe the robustness of their mainframe computers       computers designed with higher levels of ras have a multitude of features that protect data integrity and help them stay available for long periods of time without failure    this data integrity and uptime is a particular selling point for mainframes and fault tolerant systems             while ras originated as a hardware oriented term  systems thinking has extended the concept of reliability availability serviceability to systems in general  including software      note the distinction between reliability and availability  reliability measures the ability of a system to function correctly  including avoiding data corruption  whereas availability measures how often the system is available for use  even though it may not be functioning correctly  for example  a server may run forever and so have ideal availability  but may be unreliable  with frequent data corruption      physical faults can be temporary or permanent     transient and intermittent faults can typically be handled by detection and correction by e g  ecc codes or instruction replay  see below   permanent faults will lead to uncorrectable errors which can be handled by replacement by duplicate hardware  e g  processor sparing  or by the passing of the uncorrectable error to high level recovery mechanisms  a successfully corrected intermittent fault can also be reported to the os to provide information for predictive failure analysis     example hardware features for improving ras include the following  listed by subsystem     fault tolerant designs extended the idea by making ras to be the defining feature of their computers for applications like stock market exchanges or air traffic control  where system crashes would be catastrophic  fault tolerant computers  e g   see tandem computers and stratus technologies   which tend to have duplicate components running in lock step for reliability  have become less popular  due to their high cost  high availability systems  using distributed computing techniques like computer clusters  are often used as cheaper alternatives citation needed
