 a media market  broadcast market  media region  designated market area  dma   television market area  or simply market is a region where the population can receive the same  or similar  television and radio station offerings  and may also include other types of media including newspapers and internet content  they can coincide or overlap with   or more metropolitan areas  though rural regions with few significant population centers can also be designated as markets  conversely  very large metropolitan areas can sometimes be subdivided into multiple segments  market regions may overlap  meaning that people residing on the edge of one media market may be able to receive content from other nearby markets  they are widely used in audience measurements  which are compiled in the united states by nielsen media research  nielsen measures both television and radio audiences since its acquisition of arbitron  which was completed in september           markets are identified by the largest city  which are usually located in the center of the market region  however  geography and the fact that some metropolitan areas have large cities separated by some distance can make markets have unusual shapes and result in two  three  or more names being used to identify a single region  such as wichita hutchinson  kansas  chico redding  california  albany schenectady troy  new york  and harrisburg lebanon lancaster york  pennsylvania      in north america  radio markets are generally a bit smaller than their television counterparts  as broadcast power restrictions are stricter for radio than tv  and tv reaches further via cable  am band and fm band radio ratings are sometimes separated  as are broadcast and cable television  market researchers also subdivide ratings demographically between different age groups  genders  and ethnic backgrounds  as well as psychographically between income levels and other non physical factors  this information is used by advertisers to determine how to reach a specific audience  in countries such as the united kingdom  a government body defines the media markets  in countries such as the united states  media regions are defined by a privately held institution  without government status             a television market area  tma  is a group of counties in the united states covered by a specific group of television stations  the term is used by the u s  government s federal communications commission  fcc  to regulate broadcast  cable  and satellite transmissions  according to the code of federal regulations  at    cfr         and fcc gov  the tmas not only have full control over local broadcasts  but also delineate which channels will be received by satellite or cable subscribers   must carry  rules   these market areas can also be used to define restrictions on rebroadcasting of broadcast television signals  generally speaking  only stations within the same market area can be rebroadcast  the only exception to this rule is the  significantly viewed  list   virtually all of the united states is located within the boundaries of exactly one tma     a similar term used by nielsen media research is the designated market area  dma   and they control the trademark on it  dmas are used by nielsen media research to identify tv stations that best reach an area and attract the most viewers  there are     nielsen dmas in the united states     of which are metered  in other words  viewership in these markets are estimated automatically instead of through the archaic diary system still in use in the smaller markets    there are also     tmas regulated by the fcc within the united states citation needed    tmas may cover a much larger area than the stations that serve it  especially since the digital television transition  this is particularly true in markets that have hilly or mountainous terrain that is ill suited for digital broadcasting  in these cases  the outlying areas of a tma may only be served by cable and satellite  or perhaps by small translators   there are some cases  such as that of olean  new york  where a sizable number of independent stations operate  but none carry any major network affiliation unless they operate as translators  because of this  olean is considered part of the buffalo  new york market despite none of that city s major signals reaching the city from    miles away   conversely  a geographically small market such as erie  pennsylvania may have stations where their signal spills well over into neighboring tmas  most of chautauqua county  new york is closer to erie than buffalo  but the county is also located within the buffalo dma      arbitron  now nielsen audio  at one time also maintained similar areas for television ratings  each called an area of dominant influence  adi   there were     adi s in the united states  arbitron stopped offering a television ratings service     arbitron  now known as nielsen audio  maintains smaller areas for radio stations  each is called an arbitron radio metro  whereas a typical tma may cover ten counties  an arbitron market generally covers two to four  and a tma may contain two to four separate radio metros  there are     radio metros in the united states  but not all areas of the country are covered     in       nielsen began offering radio ratings in competition with arbitron  starting in those markets ranked    st and smaller      canada also has a similar system  run by numeris citation needed
