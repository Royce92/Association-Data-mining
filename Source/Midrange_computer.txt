 midrange computers  or midrange systems  are a class of computer systems which fall in between mainframe computers and microcomputers     the class emerged in the     s and machines were generally known at the time as minicomputers   especially models from digital equipment corporation  pdp line   data general  hewlett packard  hp     line and successors   and sun microsystems  sparc enterprise   these were widely used in science and research as well as for business     ibm favored the term  midrange computer  for their comparable more business oriented system    system     system     system     system     and as     ranges  which are now represented by the ibm i     since the     s  when the client server model of computing became predominant  computers of the comparable class are instead universally known as servers to recognize that they usually  serve  end users at their  client  computers     midrange systems are primarily high end network servers and other types of servers that can handle the large scale processing of many business applications  although not as powerful as mainframe computers  they are less costly to buy  operate  and maintain than mainframe systems and thus meet the computing needs of many organizations  midrange systems have become popular as powerful network servers to help manage large internet web sites  corporate intranets and extranets  and other networks  today  midrange systems include servers used in industrial process control and manufacturing plants and play major roles in computer aided manufacturing  cam   they can also take the form of powerful technical workstations for computer aided design  cad  and other computation and graphics intensive applications  midrange system are also used as front end servers to assist mainframe computers in telecommunications processing and network management
