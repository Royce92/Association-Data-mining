 xen   z n  is a hypervisor using a microkernel design  providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently     the university of cambridge computer laboratory developed the first versions of xen  the xen community develops and maintains xen as free and open source software  subject to the requirements of the gnu general public license  gpl   version    xen is currently available for the ia     x      and arm instruction sets             xen runs in a more privileged cpu state than any other software on the machine     responsibilities of the hypervisor include memory management and cpu scheduling of all virtual machines   domains    and for launching the most privileged domain   dom      the only virtual machine which by default has direct access to hardware  from the dom  the hypervisor can be managed and unprivileged domains   domu   can be launched      the dom  domain is typically a version of linux  or bsd  user domains may either be traditional operating systems  such as microsoft windows under which privileged instructions are provided by hardware virtualization instructions  if the host processor supports x   virtualization  e g   intel vt x and amd v    or para virtualized operating system whereby the operating system is aware that it is running inside a virtual machine  and so makes hypercalls directly  rather than issuing privileged instructions     xen boots from a bootloader such as gnu grub  and then usually loads a paravirtualized host operating system into the host domain  dom       xen originated as a research project at the university of cambridge  led by ian pratt  senior lecturer at cambridge who co founded xensource  inc  with simon crosby also of cambridge university  the first public release of xen was made in          xen has been supported originally by xensource inc   and since the acquisition of xensource by citrix in october       this organisation supports the development of the free software project and also sells enterprise versions of the software     on    october       citrix systems completed its acquisition of xensource   and the xen project moved to the xen org domain  this move had started some time previously  and made public the existence of the xen project advisory board  xen ab   which had members from citrix  ibm  intel  hewlett packard  novell  red hat  sun microsystems and oracle  the xen advisory board advises the xen project leader and is responsible for the xen trademark   which citrix has freely licensed to all vendors and projects that implement the xen hypervisor      citrix has also used the xen brand itself for some proprietary products unrelated to xen  including at least  xenapp  and  xendesktop      on    april       it was announced that the xen project was moved under the auspices of the linux foundation as a collaborative project   the linux foundation launched a new trademark for  xen project  to differentiate the project from any commercial use of the older  xen  trademark  a new community website was launched at xenproject org  as part of the transfer  project members at the time of the announcement included  amazon  amd  bromium  ca technologies  calxeda  cisco  citrix  google  intel  oracle  samsung  and verizon   the xen project itself is self governing       the releases up to       also added     since version     of the linux kernel  xen support for dom  and domu exists in the mainline kernel       internet hosting service companies use hypervisors to provide virtual private servers  amazon ec   ibm softlayer    liquid web  fujitsu global cloud platform    linode  orionvm   and rackspace cloud use xen as the primary vm hypervisor for their product offerings       virtual machine monitors  also known as hypervisors  also often operate on mainframes and large servers running ibm  hp  and other systems citation needed server virtualization can provide benefits such as     xen s support for virtual machine live migration from one host to another allows workload balancing and the avoidance of downtime     virtualization also has benefits when working on development  including the development of operating systems   running the new system as a guest avoids the need to reboot the physical computer whenever a bug occurs  sandboxed guest systems can also help in computer security research  allowing study of the effects of some virus or worm without the possibility of compromising the host system     finally  hardware appliance vendors may decide to ship their appliance running several guest systems  so as to be able to execute various pieces of software that require different operating systems     xen supports two different approaches to running the guest operating system  the choice of approach is up to the xen hosting system administrator     xen supports a form of virtualization known as paravirtualization  in which guests run a modified operating system  the guests are modified to use a special hypercall abi  instead of certain architectural features     through paravirtualization  xen can achieve high performance even on its host architecture  x    which has a reputation for non cooperation with traditional virtualization techniques         xen can run paravirtualized guests   pv guests  in xen terminology  even on cpus without any explicit support for virtualization     paravirtualization avoids the need to emulate a full set of hardware and firmware services  which makes a pv system simpler to manage and reduces the attack surface exposed to potentially malicious guests     on    bit x    the xen host kernel code runs in ring    while the hosted domains run in ring    kernel  and ring    applications      cpus that support virtualization make it possible to support unmodified guests  including proprietary operating systems  such as microsoft windows   this is known as hardware assisted virtualization  however in xen this is known as hardware virtual machine  hvm      hvm extensions provide additional execution modes  with an explicit distinction between the most privileged modes used by the hypervisor with access to the real hardware  called  root mode  in x    and the less privileged modes used by guest kernels and applications with  hardware  accesses under complete control of the hypervisor  in x    known as  non root mode   both root and non root mode have rings          both intel and amd have contributed modifications to xen to support their respective intel vt x and amd v architecture extensions    support for arm v a and v a virtualization extensions came with xen           hvm extensions also often offer new instructions to support direct calls by a paravirtualized guest driver into the hypervisor  typically used for i o or other operations needing high performance  these allow hvm guests with suitable minor modifications to gain many of the performance benefits of paravirtualised i o     in current versions of xen  up to      only fully virtualised hvm guests can make use of hardware support for multiple independent levels of memory protection and paging  as a result  for some workloads  hvm guests with pv drivers  also known as pv on hvm  or pvh  provide better performance than pure pv guests     xen hvm has device emulation based on the qemu project to provide i o virtualization to the virtual machines  the system emulates hardware via a patched qemu  device manager   qemu dm  daemon running as a backend in dom   this means that the virtualized machines see an emulated version of a fairly basic pc  in a performance critical environment  pv on hvm disk and network drivers are used during normal guest operation  so that the emulated pc hardware is mostly used for booting     administrators can  live migrate  xen virtual machines between physical hosts across a lan without loss of availability  during this procedure  the lan iteratively copies the memory of the virtual machine to the destination without stopping its execution  the process requires a stoppage of around       xa ms to perform final synchronization before the virtual machine begins executing at its final destination  providing an illusion of seamless migration  similar technology can serve to suspend running virtual machines to disk   freezing  their running state for resumption at a later date     the xen hypervisor has been ported to a number of processor families     xen can scale to      physical cpus      vcpus per hvm guest      vcpus per pv guest    xa tb of ram per host  and up to  xa tb of ram per hvm guest or     gb of ram per pv guest       xen can be shipped in a dedicated virtualization platform  such as citrix xenserver enterprise edition  formerly xensource s xenenterprise      alternatively  xen is distributed as an optional configuration of many standard operating systems  xen is available for and distributed with     guest systems can run fully virtualized  which requires hardware support  or paravirtualized  which requires a modified guest operating system      most operating systems which can run on pc can run as a xen hvm guest     additionally the following systems have patches allowing them to operate as paravirtualized xen guests     xen version     introduced the capability to run microsoft windows as a guest operating system unmodified if the host machine s processor supports hardware virtualization provided by intel vt x  formerly codenamed vanderpool  or amd v  formerly codenamed pacifica      during the development of xen   x  microsoft research  along with the university of cambridge operating system group  developed a port of windows xp to xen   made possible by microsoft s academic licensing program  the terms of this license do not allow the publication of this port  although documentation of the experience appears in the original xen sosp paper       james harper and the xen open source community have started developing gpl d paravirtualisation drivers for windows  these provide front end drivers for the xen block and network devices  and allow much higher disk and network performance for windows systems running in hvm mode  without these drivers all disk and network traffic has to be processed through qemu dm       third party developers have built a number of tools  known as xen management consoles  to facilitate the common tasks of administering a xen host  such as configuring  starting  monitoring and stopping of xen guests  examples include     novell s platespin orchestrate also manages xen virtual machines for xen shipping in suse linux enterprise server     the xen hypervisor is covered by the gnu general public licence  so all of these versions contain a core of free software with source code  however  many of them contain proprietary additions
