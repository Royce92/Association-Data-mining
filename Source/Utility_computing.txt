 utility computing is a service provisioning model in which a service provider makes computing resources and infrastructure management available to the customer as needed  and charges them for specific usage rather than a flat rate  like other types of on demand computing  such as grid computing   the utility model seeks to maximize the efficient use of resources and or minimize associated costs  utility is the packaging of computing resources  such as computation  storage and services  as a metered service  this model has the advantage of a low or no initial cost to acquire computer resources  instead  computational resources are essentially rented     this repackaging of computing services became the foundation of the shift to  on demand  computing  software as a service and cloud computing models that further propagated the idea of computing  application and network as a service     there was some initial skepticism about such a significant shift   however  the new model of computing caught on and eventually became mainstream     ibm  hp and microsoft were early leaders in the new field of utility computing  with their business units and researchers working on the architecture  payment and development challenges of the new computing model  google  amazon and others started to take the lead in       as they established their own utility services for computing  storage and applications     utility computing can support grid computing which has the characteristic of very large computations or a sudden peaks in demand which are supported via a large number of computers      utility computing  has usually envisioned some form of virtualization so that the amount of storage or computing power available is considerably larger than that of a single time sharing computer  multiple servers are used on the  back end  to make this possible  these might be a dedicated computer cluster specifically built for the purpose of being rented out  or even an under utilized supercomputer  the technique of running a single calculation on multiple computers is known as distributed computing     the term  grid computing  is often used to describe a particular form of distributed computing  where the supporting nodes are geographically distributed or cross administrative domains  to provide utility computing services  a company can  bundle  the resources of members of the public for sale  who might be paid with a portion of the revenue from clients     one model  common among volunteer computing applications  is for a central server to dispense tasks to participating nodes  on the behest of approved end users  in the commercial case  the paying customers   another model  sometimes called the virtual organization  vo  citation needed is more decentralized  with organizations buying and selling computing resources as needed or as they go idle     the definition of  utility computing  is sometimes extended to specialized tasks  such as web services             utility computing merely means  pay and use   with regards to computing power  utility computing is not a new concept  but rather has quite a long history  among the earliest references is      john mccarthy  speaking at the mit centennial in          ibm and other mainframe providers conducted this kind of business in the following two decades  often referred to as time sharing  offering computing power and database storage to banks and other large organizations from their world wide data centers  to facilitate this business model  mainframe operating systems evolved to include process control facilities  security  and user metering  the advent of mini computers changed this business model  by making computers affordable to almost all companies  as intel and amd increased the power of pc architecture servers with each new generation of processor  data centers became filled with thousands of servers     in the late    s utility computing re surfaced  insynq      inc  launched on demand applications and desktop hosting services in      using hp equipment  in       hp set up the utility computing division in mountain view  ca  assigning former bell labs computer scientists to begin work on a computing power plant  incorporating multiple utilities to form a software stack  services such as  ip billing on tap  were marketed  hp introduced the utility data center in       sun announced the sun cloud service to consumers in       in december       alexa launched alexa web search platform  a web search building tool for which the underlying power is utility computing  alexa charges users for storage  utilization  etc  there is space in the market for specific industries and applications as well as other niche applications powered by utility computing  for example  polyserve inc  offers a clustered file system based on commodity server and storage hardware that creates highly available utility computing environments for mission critical applications including oracle and microsoft sql server databases  as well as workload optimized solutions specifically tuned for bulk storage  high performance computing  vertical industries such as financial services  seismic processing  and content serving  the database utility and file serving utility enable it organizations to independently add servers or storage as needed  retask workloads to different hardware  and maintain the environment without disruption     in spring       tera announced its applogic service and later that summer amazon launched amazon ec   elastic compute cloud   these services allow the operation of general purpose computing applications  both are based on xen virtualization software and the most commonly used operating system on the virtual computers is linux  though windows and solaris are supported  common uses include web application  saas  image rendering and processing but also general purpose business applications     decision support and
