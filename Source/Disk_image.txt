 disk images  in computing  are computer files containing the contents and structure of a disk volume or an entire data storage device  such as a hard drive  tape drive  floppy disk  optical disc or usb flash drive  a disk image is usually created by creating a sector by sector copy of the source medium  thereby perfectly replicating the structure and contents of a storage device independent of the file system  depending on the disk image format  a disk image may span one or more computer files     disk image file formats may be open standards  such as the iso image format for optical disc images  or proprietary to particular software applications     as disk images contain the contents of entire disks  they can be huge  some disk imaging utilities are filesystem aware and can omit copying unused space from the source media  or compress the disk they represent to reduce storage requirements             disk images were originally  in the late     s  used for backup and disk cloning of mainframe disk media  the early ones were as small as   megabytes and as large as     megabytes  and the copy medium was magnetic tape  which ran as large as     megabytes per reel   disk images became much more popular when floppy disk media became popular  where replication or storage of an exact structure was necessary and efficient  especially in the case of copy protected floppy disks     disk images are used heavily for duplication of optical media including dvds  blu ray disks  etc  it is also used to make perfect clones of hard disks     a virtual disk may emulate any type of physical drive  such as a hard drive  tape drive  key drive  floppy drive  cd dvd bd hd dvd or a network share among others  and of course  since it is not physical  requires a virtual reader device matched to it  see below   an emulated drive is typically created either in ram for fast read write access  known as a ram disk   or on a hard drive  typical uses of virtual drives include the mounting of disk images of cds and dvds  and the mounting of virtual hard disks for the purpose of on the fly disk encryption   otfe       some operating systems such as linux  and mac os x  have virtual drive functionality built in  such as the loop device   while others such as microsoft windows require additional software  windows   includes native virtual drive functionality known as hyper v      virtual drives are typically read only  being used to mount existing disk images which are not modifiable by the drive  however some software provides virtual cd dvd drives which can produce new disk images  this type of virtual drive goes by a variety of names  including  virtual burner      using disk images in a virtual drive allows users to shift data between technologies  for example from cd optical drive to hard disk drive  this may provide advantages such as speed and noise  hard disk drives are typically four or five times faster than optical drives   and also quieter   in addition it may reduce power consumption  since it may allow just one device  a hard disk  to be used instead of two  hard disk plus optical drive      virtual drives may also be used as part of emulation of an entire machine  a virtual machine      since the spread of broadband  cd and dvd images have become a common medium for linux distributions   applications for mac os x are often delivered online as an apple disk image containing a file system that includes the application  documentation for the application  and so on  online data and bootable recovery cd images are provided for customers of certain commercial software companies     disk images may also be used to distribute software across a company network  or for portability  many cd dvd images can be stored on a hard disk drive   there are several types of software that allow software to be distributed to large numbers of networked machines with little or no disruption to the user  some can even be scheduled to update only at night so that machines are not disturbed during business hours  these technologies reduce end user impact and greatly reduce the time and man power needed to ensure a secure corporate environment   efficiency is also increased because there is much less opportunity for human error  disk images may also be needed to transfer software to machines without a compatible physical disk drive     for computers running mac os x  disk images are the most common file type used for software downloads  typically downloaded with a web browser  the images are typically compressed apple disk image   dmg suffix  files  they are usually opened by directly mounting them without using a real disk  the advantage compared with some other technologies  such as zip and rar archives  is they do not need redundant drive space for the unarchived data     software packages for windows are also sometimes distributed as disk images including iso images  while windows versions prior to windows   do not natively support mounting disk images to the files system  several software options are available to do this  see comparison of disc image software     virtual hard disks are often used in on the fly disk encryption   otfe   software such as freeotfe and truecrypt  where an encrypted  image  of a disk is stored on the computer  when the disk s password is entered  the disk image is  mounted   and made available as a new volume on the computer  files written to this virtual drive are written to the encrypted image  and never stored in cleartext     the process of making a computer disk available for use is called  mounting   the process of removing it is called  dismounting  or  unmounting   the same terms are used for making an encrypted disk available or unavailable     a hard disk image is interpreted by a virtual machine monitor as a system hard disk drive  it administrators and software developers administer them through offline operations using built in or third party tools  in terms of naming  a hard disk image for a certain virtual machine monitor has a specific file type extension  e g    vmdk for vmware vmdk   vhd for xen and microsoft hyper v   vdi for oracle vm virtualbox  etc      hard drive imaging is used in several major application areas     there are two schemes predominant across all virtual machine monitor implementations     the virtual disk is implemented as either split over a collection of flat files  typically each one is  gb in size  collectively called a split flat file  or as a single  large monolithic flat file  the pre allocated storage scheme is also referred to as a thick provisioning  scheme     the virtual disk can again be implemented using split or monolithic files  except that storage is allocated on demand  several virtual machine monitor implementations initialize the storage with zeros before providing it to the virtual machine that is in operation  the dynamic growth storage scheme is also referred to as a thin provisioning  scheme     there are two modes in which a raw disk can be mapped for use by a virtual machine     some backup programs only back up user files  boot information and files locked by the operating system  such as those in use at the time of the backup  may not be saved on some operating systems  a disk image contains all files  faithfully replicating all data  for this reason  it is also used for backing up cds and dvds     non software type files can usually be backed up with file based backup software  and this is preferred because file based backup usually saves more time or space because they never copy unused space  as a bit identical image does   they usually are capable of incremental backups  and generally have more flexibility  but for software files  file based backup solutions may fail to reproduce all necessary characteristics  particularly with windows systems  for example  in windows certain registry keys use short filenames  which are sometimes not reproduced by file based backup  some commercial software uses copy protection that will cause problems if a file is moved to a different disk sector  and file based backups do not always reproduce metadata such as security attributes  creating a bit identical disk image is one way to ensure the system backup will be exactly as the original  bit identical images can be made in linux with dd  available on nearly all live cds     most commercial imaging software is  user friendly  and  automatic  but may not create bit identical images  these programs have most of the same advantages  except that they may allow restoring to partitions of a different size or file allocation size  and thus may not put files on the same exact sector  additionally  if they do not support windows vista  they may slightly move or realign partitions and thus make vista unbootable  see windows vista startup process      large enterprises often need to buy or replace new computer systems in large numbers  installing operating system and programs into each of them one by one requires a lot of time and effort and has a significant possibility of human error  therefore  system administrators use disk imaging to quickly clone the fully prepared software environment of a reference system  this method saves time and effort and allows administrators to focus on unique distinctions that each system must bear     there are several types of disk imaging software available that use single instancing technology to reduce the time  bandwidth  and storage required to capture and archive disk images  this makes it possible to rebuild and transfer information rich disk images at lightning speeds  which is a significant improvement over the days when programmers spent hours configuring each machine within an organization      emulators frequently use disk images to simulate the floppy drive of the computer being emulated  this is usually simpler to program than accessing a real floppy drive  particularly if the disks are in a format not supported by the host operating system   and allows a large library of software to be managed     a mini image is an optical disc image file in a format that fakes the disk s content to bypass cd dvd copy protection     because they are the full size of the original disk  mini images are stored instead  mini images are small  on the order of kilobytes  and contain just the information necessary to bypass cd checks  therefore  the mini image is a form of a no cd crack  for pirated games  and legally backed up games  mini images do not contain the real data from an image file  just the code that is needed to satisfy the cd check  they cannot provide cd or dvd backed data to the computer program such as on disk image or video files     creating a disk image is achieved with a suitable program  different disk imaging programs have varying capabilities  and may focus on hard drive imaging  including hard drive backup  restore and rollout   or optical media imaging  cd dvd images      a virtual disk writer or virtual burner is a computer program that emulates an actual disc authoring device such as a cd writer or dvd writer  instead of writing data to an actual disc  it creates a virtual disk image     a virtual burner  by definition  appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities  as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create virtual disk images   thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs       in most cases  a file format is tied to a particular software package  the software defines and uses its own  often proprietary  image format  though some formats are widely supported by open standards  these formats are supported by nearly all optical disc software packages     rawwrite and winimage are examples of floppy disk image file writer creator for ms dos and microsoft windows  they can be used to create raw image files from a floppy disk  and write such image files to a floppy     in unix or similar systems the dd program can be used to create disk images  or to write them to a particular disk  it is also possible to mount and access them at block level using a loop device     apple disk copy can be used on mac os systems to create and write disk image files     authoring software for cds dvds such as nero burning rom can generate and load disk images for optical media
