 hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower  the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water  it is the most widely used form of renewable energy  accounting for    percent of global electricity generation         terawatt hours of electricity production in        and is expected to increase about      each year for the next    years     hydropower is produced in     countries  with the asia pacific region generating    percent of global hydropower in       china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with     terawatt hours of production in       representing around    percent of domestic electricity use  there are now four hydroelectricity stations larger than   xa gw  the three gorges dam and xiluodu dam in china  itaipu dam across the brazil paraguay border  and guri dam in venezuela      the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low  making it a competitive source of renewable electricity  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than    megawatts is   to   u s  cents per kilowatt hour   it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  however  damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems  and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife   once a hydroelectric complex is constructed  the project produces no direct waste  and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide  co   than fossil fuel powered energy plants                  hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks  in the mid     s  french engineer bernard forest de b lidor published architecture hydraulique which described vertical  and horizontal axis hydraulic machines  by the late   th century  the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics   the growing demand for the industrial revolution would drive development as well   in      the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at cragside in northumberland  england by william george armstrong  it was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery   the old schoelkopf power station no    near niagara falls in the u s  side began to produce electricity in       the first edison hydroelectric power station  the vulcan street plant  began operating september           in appleton  wisconsin  with an output of about      kilowatts   by      there were    hydroelectric power stations in the u s  and canada  by      there were     in the u s  alone      at the beginning of the   th century  many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas  grenoble  france held the international exhibition of hydropower and tourism with over one million visitors  by      as     of the power produced in the united states was hydroelectric  the federal power act was enacted into law  the act created the federal power commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water  as the power stations became larger  their associated dams developed additional purposes to include flood control  irrigation and navigation  federal funding became necessary for large scale development and federally owned corporations  such as the tennessee valley authority        and the bonneville power administration        were created   additionally  the bureau of reclamation which had begun a series of western u s  irrigation projects in the early   th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the      hoover dam   the u s  army corps of engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development  completing the bonneville dam in      and being recognized by the flood control act of      as the premier federal flood control agency       hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the   th century  hydropower was referred to as white coal for its power and plenty    hoover dam s initial       mw power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in       it was eclipsed by the      mw grand coulee dam in         the itaipu dam opened in      in south america as the largest  producing        mw but was surpassed in      by the three gorges dam in china at        mw  hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries  including norway  democratic republic of the congo  paraguay and brazil  with over     of their electricity  the united states currently has over       hydroelectric power stations that supply      of its total electrical production output  which is     of its renewable electricity      most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator  the power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water s outflow  this height difference is called the head  the amount of potential energy in water is proportional to the head  a large pipe  the  penstock   delivers water to the turbine       this method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations  at times of low electrical demand  the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir  when the demand becomes greater  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine  pumped storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large scale grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system  pumped storage is not an energy source  and appears as a negative number in listings       run of the river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity  so that the water coming from upstream must be used for generation at that moment  or must be allowed to bypass the dam  in the united states  run of the river hydropower could potentially provide        mw  about       of total use in      if continuously available        a tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides  such sources are highly predictable  and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs  can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods  less common types of hydro schemes use water s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot waterwheels  tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world  in great britain  there are eight sites that could be developed  which have the potential to generate     of the electricity used in            although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations  facilities from over a few hundred megawatts to more than    gw are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities  currently  only three facilities over    gw         mw  are in operation worldwide  three gorges dam at      gw  itaipu dam at    gw  and guri dam at      gw  large scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world  with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations     small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant  the definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to    megawatts  mw  is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro  this may be stretched to    mw and    mw in canada and the united states  small scale hydroelectricity production grew by     during      from       raising the total world small hydro capacity to    gw  over     of this was in china     gw   followed by japan      gw   the united states    gw   and india    gw        small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low cost renewable energy  alternatively  small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network  or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network  since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work  they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro  this decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production     micro hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to     kw of power  these installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community  or are sometimes connected to electric power networks  there are many of these installations around the world  particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel    micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas  water flow  and thus available hydro power  is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum     pico hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power generation of under   kw  it is useful in small  remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity  for example  to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a tv or radio for a few homes    even smaller turbines of        w may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only  xa m   xa ft   a pico hydro setup is typically run of the river  meaning that dams are not used  but rather pipes divert some of the flow  drop this down a gradient  and through the turbine before returning it to the stream     an underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways  such as a waterfall or mountain lake  an underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway     a simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is    where    annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply  in some installations  the water flow rate can vary by a factor of      over the course of a year     hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands   hydro turbines have a start up time of the order of a few minutes    it takes around    to    seconds to bring a unit from cold start up to full load  this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants    power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation    hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs    instead  it serves as backup for non hydro generators       the major advantage of hydroelectricity is elimination of the cost of fuel  the cost of operating a hydroelectric station is nearly immune to increases in the cost of fossil fuels such as oil  natural gas or coal  and no imports are needed  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than    megawatts is   to   u s  cents per kilowatt hour      hydroelectric stations have long economic lives  with some plants still in service after        years    operating labor cost is also usually low  as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation     where a dam serves multiple purposes  a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost  providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation  it has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the three gorges dam will cover the construction costs after   to   years of full generation    additionally  some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return  unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place       while many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks  some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises  dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants  for example  the grand coulee dam switched to support alcoa aluminium in bellingham  washington  united states for american world war ii airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens  in addition to aluminium power  after the war  in suriname  the brokopondo reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the alcoa aluminium industry  new zealand s manapouri power station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at tiwai point     since hydroelectric dams do not burn fossil fuels  they do not directly produce carbon dioxide  while some carbon dioxide is produced during manufacture and construction of the project  this is a tiny fraction of the operating emissions of equivalent fossil fuel electricity generation  one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the paul scherrer institut and the university of stuttgart which was funded by the european commission    according to that study  hydroelectricity produces the least amount of greenhouse gases and externality of any energy source    coming in second place was wind  third was nuclear energy  and fourth was solar photovoltaic    the low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates  the above study was for local energy in europe  presumably similar conditions prevail in north america and northern asia  which all see a regular  natural freeze thaw cycle  with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth   greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas       reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports  and become tourist attractions themselves  in some countries  aquaculture in reservoirs is common  multi use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply  large hydro dams can control floods  which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project       large reservoirs required for the operation of hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams  destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests  marshland and grasslands  the loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir       hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site  generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment  water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment  which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks    since turbine gates are often opened intermittently  rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed     when water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream  this has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations  particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation  siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam  eventually  some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over top during a flood and fail         changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam  lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity  the result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power  the risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change    one study from the colorado river in the united states suggest that modest climate changes  such as an increase in temperature in   degree celsius resulting in a     decline in precipitation  might reduce river run off by up to        brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heaving reliance on hydroelectricity  as increasing temperatures  lower water  ow and alterations in the rainfall regime  could reduce total energy production by    annually by the end of the century       lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions  as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane  this is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment  and forming methane  a greenhouse gas  according to the world commission on dams report    where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity  less than     watts per square metre of surface area  and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir  greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil fired thermal generation plant       in boreal reservoirs of canada and northern europe  however  greenhouse gas emissions are typically only    to    of any kind of conventional fossil fuel thermal generation  a new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay       another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned  in       the world commission on dams estimated that dams had physically displaced       million people worldwide       because large conventional dammed hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water  a failure due to poor construction  natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure  dam failures have been some of the largest man made disasters in history     the banqiao dam failure in southern china directly resulted in the deaths of        people  and another         from epidemics  millions were left homeless  also  the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as      disaster at vajont dam in italy  where almost       people died       smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk  but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned  for example  the small kelly barnes dam failed in       causing    deaths with the toccoa flood  ten years after its power station was decommissioned the earthen embankment dam failed       hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion  including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide  nitric oxide  carbon monoxide  dust  and mercury in the coal  hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions  compared to nuclear power  hydroelectricity generates no nuclear waste  has none of the dangers associated with uranium mining  nor nuclear leaks     compared to wind farms  hydroelectricity power stations have a more predictable load factor  if the project has a storage reservoir  it can generate power when needed  hydroelectric stations can be easily regulated to follow variations in power demand     the ranking of hydro electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating  hydro accounted for    percent of global electricity consumption  and       terawatt hours of electricity production in       which continues the rapid rate of increase experienced between      and           hydropower is produced in     countries  with the asia pacific region generated    percent of global hydropower in       china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with     terawatt hours of production in       representing around    percent of domestic electricity use  brazil  canada  new zealand  norway  paraguay  austria  switzerland  and venezuela have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power  paraguay produces      of its electricity from hydroelectric dams  and exports     of its production to brazil and to argentina  norway produces        of its electricity from hydroelectric sources       there are now three hydroelectric stations larger than    gw  the three gorges dam in china  itaipu dam across the brazil paraguay border  and guri dam in venezuela      a hydro electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year  the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the capacity factor  the installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings       construction
