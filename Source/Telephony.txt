 telephony   t  l f ni  t  lef   nee  is the field of technology involving the development  application  and deployment of telecommunication services for the purpose of electronic transmission of voice  fax  or data  between distant parties  the history of telephony is intimately linked to the invention and development of the telephone     telephony is commonly referred to as the construction or operation of telephones and telephonic systems and as a system of telecommunications in which telephonic equipment is employed in the transmission of speech or other sound between points  with or without the use of wires   the term is also used frequently to refer to computer hardware  software  and computer network systems  that perform functions traditionally performed by telephone equipment  in this context the technology is specifically referred to as internet telephony  or voice over internet protocol  voip              the first telephones were connected directly in pairs  each user had a separate telephone wired to the locations he might wish to reach  this quickly became inconvenient and unmanageable when people wanted to communicate with more than a few people  the inventions of the telephone exchange provided the solution for establishing telephone connections with any other telephone in service in the local area  each telephone was connected to the exchange via one wire pair  the local loop  nearby exchanges in other service areas were connected with trunk lines and long distance service could be established by relaying the calls through multiple exchanges     initially the switchboards were manually operated by an attendant  a switchboard operator  when a customer cranked a handle on the telephone  it turned on an indicator on the board in front of the operator who would plug the operator headset into that jack and offer service  the caller had to ask for the called party by name  later by number  and the operator connected one end of a circuit into the called party jack to alert them  if the called station answered the operator disconnected their headset and complete the station to station circuit  trunk calls were made with the assistance of other operators at other exchangers in the network     in modern times  most telephones are plugged into telephone jacks  the jacks are connected by inside wiring to a drop wire which connects the building to a cable  cables usually bring a large number of drop wires from all over a district access network to one wire center or telephone exchange  when a telephone user wants to make a telephone call  equipment at the exchange examines the dialed telephone number and connects that telephone line to another in the same wire center  or to a trunk to a distant exchange  most of the exchanges in the world are interconnected through a system of larger switching systems  forming the public switched telephone network  pstn      after the middle of the   th century  fax and data became important secondary users of the network created to carry voices  and late in the century  parts of the network were upgraded with isdn and dsl to improve handling of such traffic     today  telephony uses digital technology  digital telephony  in the provisioning of telephone services and systems  telephone calls can be provided digitally  but may be restricted to cases in which the last mile is digital  or where the conversion between digital and analog signals takes place inside the telephone  this advancement has reduced costs in communication  and improved the quality of voice services  the first implementation of this was  isdn  that permitted all data transport from end to end speedily over telephone lines  this service was later made much less important due to the ability to provide digital services based on the ip protocol     since the advent of personal computer technology in the     s  computer telephony integration has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services  initiated and controlled by the computer  such as making and receiving voice  fax  and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification  the integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development in the evolution of the automated office  the term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers  such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you re calling  it s also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls  in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center    cti is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks  but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation  primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification  which is a telephone service architecture that separates cti services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services  dialed number identification service  dnis  on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage  a new generation of applications  middleware  is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links     the term s scope has been broadened with the advent of the different new communication technologies  in its broadest sense  the terms encompasses phone communication  internet calling  mobile communication  faxing  voicemail and video conferencing  telephony s initial idea returns to pots   an acronym for  plain old telephone service   technically called the pstn  public switched telephone network      this system is being fiercely challenged by and to a great extent yielding to voice over ip  voip  technology  which is also commonly referred to as ip telephony and internet telephony  ip telephony is a modern form of telephony which uses the tcp ip protocol popularized by the internet to transmit digitized voice data  also  unlike traditional phone service  ip telephony service is relatively unregulated by government  in the united states  the federal communications commission  fcc  regulates phone to phone connections  but says they do not plan to regulate connections between a phone user and an ip telephony service provider using the internet  calls travel as packets of data on shared lines  avoiding the tolls of the pstn  the challenge in ip telephony is to deliver the voice  fax  or video packets in a dependable flow to the user  much of ip telephony focuses on that challenge      starting with the introduction of the transistor  invented in      by bell laboratories  to amplification and switching circuits in the     s  and through development of computer based electronic switching systems  the public switched telephone network  pstn  has gradually evolved towards automation and digitization of signaling and audio transmissions     digital telephony is the use of digital electronics in the operation and provisioning of telephony systems and services  since the     s a digital core network has replaced the traditional analog transmission and signaling systems  and much of the access network has also been digitized     digital telephony has dramatically improved the capacity  quality  and cost of the network  end to end analog telephone networks were first modified in the early     s by upgrading transmission networks with digital signal    ds  t   carrier systems  designed to support the basic  xa khz voice channel by sampling the bandwidth limited analog voice signal and encoding using pcm  while digitization allows wideband voice on the same channel  the improved quality of a wider analog voice channel did not find a large market in the pstn     later transmission methods such as sonet and fiber optic transmission further advanced digital transmission  although analog carrier systems existed that multiplexed multiple analog voice channels onto a single transmission medium  digital transmission allowed lower cost and more channels multiplexed on the transmission medium  today the end instrument often remains analog but the analog signals are typically converted to digital signals at the serving area interface  sai   central office  co   or other aggregation point  digital loop carriers  dlc  place the digital network ever closer to the customer premises  relegating the analog local loop to legacy status     a specialization of digital telephony  internet protocol  ip  telephony involves the application of digital networking technology that were the foundation to the internet to create  transmit  and receive telecommunications sessions over computer networks  internet telephony is commonly known as voice over internet protocol  voip   reflecting the principle  but it has been referred with many other terms  voip has proven to be a disruptive technology that is rapidly replacing traditional telephone infrastructure technologies  as of january       up to     of telephone subscribers in japan and south korea have switched to this digital telephone service  a january      newsweek article suggested that internet telephony may be  the next big thing    as of      many voip companies offer service to consumers and businesses     ip telephony uses an internet connection and hardware ip phones  analog telephone adapters  or softphone computer applications to transmit conversations encoded as data packets  in addition to replacing plain old telephone service  pots   ip telephony services are also competing with mobile phone services by offering free or lower cost connections via wifi hotspots  voip is also used on private networks which may or may not have a connection to the global telephone network     direct person to person communication includes non verbal cues expressed in facial and other bodily articulation  that cannot be transmitted in traditional voice telephony  video telephony restores such interactions to varying degrees  social context cues theory is a model to measure the success of different types of communication in maintaining the non verbal cues present in face to face interactions  the research examines many different cues  such as the physical context  different facial expressions  body movements  tone of voice  touch and smell     various communication cues are lost with the usage of the telephone  the communicating parties are not able to identify the body movements  and lack touch and smell  although this diminished ability to identify social cues is well known  wiesenfeld  raghuram  and garud point out that there is a value and efficiency to the type of communication for different tasks citation needed they examine work places in which different types of communication  such as the telephone  are more useful than face to face interaction     the expansion of communication to mobile telephone service has created a different filter of the social cues than the land line telephone  the use of instant messaging  such as texting  on mobile telephones has created a sense of community  in the social construction of mobile telephony it is suggested that each phone call and text message is more than an attempt to converse  instead  it is a gesture which maintains the social network between family and friends  although there is a loss of certain social cues through telephones  mobile phones bring new forms of expression of different cues that are understood by different audiences  new language additives attempt to compensate for the inherent lack of non physical interaction
