 operating systems based on the linux kernel are used in embedded systems such as consumer electronics  i e  set top boxes  smart tvs  in vehicle infotainment  ivi   networking equipment  such as wireless routers   machine control  industrial automation  navigation equipment  spacecraft flight software  and medical instruments in general      thanks to their nature of versatility  operating systems based on the linux kernel can be also found in mobile devices that are actually touchscreen based embedded devices  such as smartphones and tablets  together with personal digital assistants  pdas  and portable media players that also include a touchscreen             the linux kernel has been ported to a variety of cpus which are not only primarily used as the processor of a desktop or server computer  but also arc  arm  avr    etrax cris  fr v  h      ip      m  k  mips  mn       powerpc  superh  and xtensa processors  linux is also used as an alternative to using a proprietary operating system and its associated toolchain      due to its low cost and ease of customization  linux has been shipped in many consumer devices  devices covering pdas  like the sharp zaurus family   tomtom gps navigation devices  residential gateways like the linksys wrt  g series or smartphones such as the motorola exz series  openmoko handsets  and the nokia n    and nokia n      a linux kernel based operating system known as android  developed by google  has become a highly competitive platform for smartphones and tablets  first introduced in       in july       android s smartphone market share in the united states was          with the availability of consumer embedded devices  communities of users and developers were formed around theses devices  replacement or enhancements of the linux distribution shipped on the device has often been made possible thanks to availability of the source code and to the communities surrounding the devices  due to the high number of devices  standardized build systems have appeared like openembedded  buildroot  openwrt  and ltib     the advantages of embedded linux over proprietary embedded operating systems include multiple suppliers for software  development and support  no royalties or licensing fees  a stable kernel  the ability to read  modify and redistribute the source code  the technical disadvantages include a comparatively large memory footprint  kernel and root filesystem   complexities of user mode and kernel mode memory access  and a complex device drivers framework
