 a data storage device is a device for recording  storing  information  data   recording can be done using virtually any form of energy  spanning from manual muscle power in handwriting  to acoustic vibrations in phonographic recording  to electromagnetic energy modulating magnetic tape and optical discs     a storage device may hold information  process information  or both  a device that only holds information is a recording medium  devices that process information  data storage equipment  may either access a separate portable  removable  recording medium or a permanent component to store and retrieve information     electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve that data  most storage devices that do not require vision and a brain to read data fall into this category  electromagnetic data may be stored in either an analog data or digital data format on a variety of media  this type of data is considered to be electronically encoded data  whether or not it is electronically stored in a semiconductor device  for it is certain that a semiconductor device was used to record it on its medium  most electronically processed data storage media  including some forms of computer data storage  are considered permanent  non volatile  storage  that is  the data will remain stored when power is removed from the device  in contrast  most electronically stored information within most types of semiconductor  computer chips  microcircuits are volatile memory  for it vanishes if power is removed     with the exception of barcodes and ocr data  electronic data storage is easier to revise and may be more cost effective than alternative methods due to smaller physical space requirements and the ease of replacing  rewriting  data on the same medium  however  the durability of methods such as printed data is still superior to that of most electronic storage media  the durability limitations may be overcome with the ease of duplicating  backing up  electronic data             devices that are not used exclusively for recording  e g  hands  mouths  musical instruments  and devices that are intermediate the storing retrieving process  e g  eyes  ears  cameras  scanners  microphones  speakers  monitors  video projectors  are not usually considered storage devices  devices that are exclusively for recording  e g  printers   exclusively for reading  e g  barcode readers   or devices that process only one form of information  e g  phonographs  may or may not be considered storage devices  in computing these are known as input output devices     all information is data  however  not all data is information     many data storage devices are also media players  any device that can store and playback multimedia may also be considered a media player such as in the case with the hd media player  designated hard drives are used to play saved or streaming media on home cinemas or home theater pcs     in a recent study in science it was estimated that the world s technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than    optimally compressed  exabytes in       to      optimally compressed  exabytes in        doubling roughly every   years      in a less comprehensive study  the international data corporation estimated that the total amount of digital data was     exabytes in       and had for the first time exceeded the amount of storage      it is estimated that the year      marked the beginning of the digital age for information storage  the year that marked the date when human kind started to store more information on digital than on analog storage devices   in      only    of the world s capacity to store information was in digital format  which grew to    by           in the year       and exploded to     of the world s storage capacity by          any input output equipment may be considered data storage equipment if it writes to and reads from a data storage medium     data storage equipment uses either     the following are examples of those methods     a recording medium is a physical material that holds data expressed in any of the existing recording formats  with electronic media  the data and the recording medium is sometimess part of the surface of the medium     some recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature  volatile organic compounds may be used to preserve the environment or to purposely make data expire over time  data such as smoke signals or skywriting are temporary by nature     a typical way to classify data storage media is to consider its shape and type of movement  or non movement  relative to the read write device s  of the storage apparatus as listed     bekenstein        foresees that miniaturization might lead to the invention of devices that store bits on a single atom      especially for carrying around data  the weight and volume per mb are relevant  they are quite large for written and printed paper compared with modern electronic media  on the other hand  written and printer paper do not require  the weight and volume of  reading equipment  and handwritten edits only require simple writing equipment  such as a pen     with mobile data connections the data need not be carried around to be available
