explore ways to improve the facebook experience         on june           facebook introduced a  usernames  feature  whereby pages can be linked with simpler urls such as https   www facebook com facebook instead of https   www facebook com profile php id                 many new smartphones offer access to facebook services through either their web browsers or applications  an official facebook application is available for the operating systems android  ios  webos  and firefox os  nokia and research in motion both provide facebook applications for their own mobile devices  as of january           million active users access facebook through mobile devices every day  sherr  ian  january             facebook mobile users hit new highs  revenue jumps   cnet  retrieved march         xa     in may       facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles  if a user does not provide key information  such as location  hometown  or relationship status  other users can use a new  ask  button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click        on september          news feed was announced  which appears on every user s homepage and highlights information including profile changes  upcoming events  and birthdays of the user s friends     this enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause     initially  the news feed caused dissatisfaction among facebook users  some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information  others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities  such as relationship status changes  events  and conversations with other users         in response  zuckerberg issued an apology for the site s failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features  since then  users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends  users are now able to prevent user set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities  including profile changes  wall posts  and newly added friends        on february           facebook was granted a patent    on certain aspects of its news feed  the patent covers news feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user     the patent may encourage facebook to pursue action against websites that violate its patent  which may potentially include websites such as twitter        one of the most popular applications on facebook is the photos application  where users can upload albums and photos     facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos  compared with other image hosting services such as photobucket and flickr  which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload  during the first years  facebook users were limited to   xa photos per album  as of may       this limit has been increased to    xa photos per album                 privacy settings can be set for individual albums  limiting the groups of users that can see an album  for example  the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user s friends can see the album  while the privacy of another album can be set so that all facebook users can see it  another feature of the photos application is the ability to  tag   or label  users in a photo  for instance  if a photo contains a user s friend  then the user can tag the friend in the photo  this sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged  and provides them a link to see the photo        on june          facebook launched its app center to its users  it will help the users in finding games and other applications with ease     since the launch of the app center  facebook has seen    m monthly users with     times the installation of apps        the sorting and display of stories in a user s news feed is governed by the edgerank algorithm        the like button is a social networking feature  allowing users to express their appreciation of content such as status updates  comments  photos  and advertisements  it is also a social plug in of the facebook platformxa   launched on april               xa   that enables participating internet websites to display a similar like button     following the termination by the sheriff of hampton  virginia  us of employees who liked the facebook page of an adversary  a federal appeals court in virginia handed down a decision that the us constitution protects the rights of us citizens to like any facebook page of their choosing  us circuit judge william traxler likened the practice to displaying a  political sign in one s front yard         following a lengthy period of calls from the public to include a dislike button on the facebook interface  zuckerberg explained in a q a session on december           that his reticence was due to a concern about a tone of negativity on the platform whereby users could  shame  others and he offered the comment option for situations where people were unwilling to use the like function  however  he said   we re facebook thinking about it dislike button     it s an interesting question   and said that he likes the idea of facebook users being able to express a greater variety of emotions        on september           facebook added the ability for users to provide a  subscribe  button on their page  which allows users to subscribe to public postings by the user without needing to add them as a friend     in conjunction  facebook also introduced a system in february      to verify the identity of certain accounts  unlike a similar system used by twitter  verified accounts do not display a special verification badge  but are given a higher priority in a user s  subscription suggestions         in december       facebook announced that due to user confusion surrounding its function  the subscribe button would be re labeled as a  follow  button making it more similar to other social networks with similar functions        the media often compares facebook to myspace  but one significant difference between the two web sites is the level of customization     another difference is facebook s requirement that users give their true identity  a demand that myspace does not make     myspace allows users to decorate their profiles using html and cascading style sheets  css   while facebook allows only plain text     facebook has a number of features with which users may interact  they include the wall  a space on every user s profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see     pokes  which allows users to send a virtual  poke  to each other  a notification then tells a user that they have been poked      photos  where users can upload albums and photos     and status  which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions     depending on privacy settings  anyone who can see a user s profile can also view that user s wall  in july       facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the wall  whereas the wall was previously limited to textual content only        facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile     the website is free to its users and generates revenue from advertising  such as banner ads     facebook requires a user s name and profile picture  if applicable  to be accessible by everyone  users can control who sees other information they have shared  as well as who can find them in searches  through their privacy settings        on november          facebook launched facebook beacon  which was a part of facebook s advertisement system until it was discontinued in       its purpose was to allow targeted advertisements and allowing users to share their activities with their friends     in       facebook s security team began expanding its efforts to reduce the risks to users  privacy     but privacy concerns remain        since       among other social media services  the national security agency has been taking publicly posted profile information from users facebook profiles to discover who they interact with        on november           facebook settled federal trade commission charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises        in august      high tech bridge published a study showing that links included in facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by facebook     in january      two users filed a lawsuit against facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice        on july           facebook announced its bug bounty program in which security researchers will be paid a minimum of      for reporting security holes on facebook website  facebook s whitehat page for security researchers says   if you give us a reasonable time to respond to your report before making any information public and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations  destruction of data  and interruption or degradation of our service during your research  we will not bring any lawsuit against you or ask law enforcement to investigate you            facebook started paying researchers who find and report security bugs by issuing them custom branded  white hat  debit cards that can be reloaded with funds each time the researchers discover new flaws   researchers who find bugs and security improvements are rare  and we value them and have to find ways to reward them   ryan mcgeehan  former manager of facebook s security response team  told cnet in an interview   having this exclusive black card is another way to recognize them  they can show up at a conference and show this card and say  i did special work for facebook          india  which has the second largest number of bug hunters in the world     tops the facebook bug bounty program with the largest number of valid bugs   researchers in russia earned the highest amount per

posed the biggest threat to security  well ahead of myspace  twitter  and linkedin        facebook is the most popular social networking site in several english speaking countries  including canada     the united kingdom     and the united states              however  facebook still receives limited adoption in countries such as japan  where domestically created social networks are still largely preferred     in regional internet markets  facebook penetration is highest in north america     percent   followed by middle east africa     percent   latin america     percent   europe     percent   and asia pacific     percent      some of the top competitors were listed in      by mashable        the website has won awards such as placement into the  top     classic websites  by pc magazine in          and winning the  people s voice award  from the webby awards in          in a      study conducted by student monitor  a company specializing in research concerning the college student market  facebook was named the second most popular thing among undergraduates  tied with beer and only ranked lower than the ipod        in       facebook won the crunchie  best overall startup or product  for the third year in a row    and was recognized as one of the  hottest silicon valley companies  by lead        however  in a july      survey performed by the american customer satisfaction index  facebook received a score of    out of      placing it in the bottom    of all private sector companies in terms of customer satisfaction  alongside industries such as the irs e file system  airlines  and cable companies  the reasons why facebook scored so poorly include privacy problems  frequent changes to the website s interface  the results returned by the news feed  and spam        in december       the supreme court of the australian capital territory ruled that facebook is a valid protocol to serve court notices to defendants  it is believed to be the world s first legal judgement that defines a summons posted on facebook as legally binding     in march       the new zealand high court associate justice david gendall allowed for the serving of legal papers on craig axe by the company axe market garden via facebook        employers have also used facebook as a means to keep tabs on their employees and have even been known to fire them over posts they have made        by       the use of facebook had already become so ubiquitous that the generic verb  facebooking  had come into use to describe the process of browsing others  profiles or updating one s own     in       collins english dictionary declared  facebook  as its new word of the year     in december       the new oxford american dictionary declared its word of the year to be the verb  unfriend   defined as  to remove someone as a  friend  on a social networking site such as facebook        in early       openbook was established  an avowed parody  and privacy advocacy  website    that enables text based searches of those wall posts that are available to  everyone   i e  to everyone on the internet     writers for the wall street journal found in      that facebook apps were transmitting identifying information to  dozens of advertising and internet tracking companies   the apps used an http referrer which exposed the user s identity and sometimes their friends   facebook said   we have taken immediate action to disable all applications that violate our terms         in january       the countries with the most facebook users were        facebook s popularity throughout the world  especially as a tool for political movements or procrastination  has led to some countries and employers blocking access to the site     all of the above total     million members or about      percent of facebook s   billion worldwide members     as of march       facebook reported having      billion monthly active users  globally        in regards to facebook s mobile usage  per an analyst report in early       there are     million android users      million iphone users     million ipad users and    million messenger users  and a total of     million mobile facebook users        facebook popularity  active users of facebook increased from just a million in      to over     million in             population pyramid of facebook users by age as of january               on april           greenpeace released a report showing that of the top ten big brands in cloud computing  facebook relied the most on coal for electricity for its data centers  at the time  data centers consumed up to    of all global electricity and this amount was projected to increase  phil radford of greenpeace said  we are concerned that this new explosion in electricity use could lock us into old  polluting energy sources instead of the clean energy available today      on thursday  december           greenpeace and facebook announced together that facebook would shift to use clean and renewable energy to power its own operations  marcy scott lynn  of facebook s sustainability program  said it looked forward  to a day when our primary energy sources are clean and renewable  and that the company is  working with greenpeace and others to help bring that day closer            in may      emails were sent to journalists and bloggers making critical allegations about google s privacy policies  however it was later discovered that pr giant burson marsteller was paid for the emails by facebook         a      study in the online journal first monday  examines how parents consistently enable children as young as    years old to sign up for accounts  directly violating facebook s policy banning young visitors  this policy is in compliance with a united states law  the      children s online privacy protection act  which requires minors aged    or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites  in other jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age  facebook enforces the lower age  of the       households surveyed for the study      of parents reported that their child joined facebook when they were younger than     the minimum age in the site s terms of service  the study also reported that facebook removes roughly        users each day for violating its minimum age policy  the study s authors also note   indeed  facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join   the findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of united states federal law  but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors  only     of parents said they were aware that facebook has a minimum signup age      of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation  or thought the signup age was    or     and not           in november       several facebook users in bangalore  india reported that their accounts had been hacked and their profile pictures replaced with pornographic images  for more than a week  users  news feeds were spammed with pornographic  violent and sexual content  and it was reported that more than         accounts were affected  facebook described the reports as inaccurate  and bangalore police speculated that the stories may have been rumors spread by facebook s competitors           on august           facebook s guest service treatment was widely decried  that day  it was reported that a facebook user from yatta  west bank       khalil shreateh had found a bug that allowed him to post material to other users  facebook walls  users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the facebook walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to  to prove that he was telling the truth  shreateh posted material to sarah goodin s wall  a friend of facebook ceo mark zuckerberg  following this  shreateh contacted facebook s security team with the proof that his bug was real  explaining in detail what was going on  facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a      usd fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market  however  it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying shreateh the fee  facebook originally told him that  this was not a bug  and dismissed him  shreateh then tried a second time to inform facebook  but they dismissed him yet again  on the third try  shreateh used the bug to post a message to mark zuckerberg s wall  stating  sorry for breaking your privacy     but a couple of days ago  i found a serious facebook exploit  and that facebook s security team was not taking him seriously  within minutes  a security engineer contacted shreateh  questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system  facebook temporarily suspended shreateh s account and fixed the bug after several days  facebook refused to pay out the bounty to shreateh  stating that by posting to zuckerberg s account  shreateh had violated one of their terms of service policies and therefore  could not be paid   facebook also noted that in shreateh s initial reports  he had failed to provide technical details for facebook to act on the bug              on august           yahoo news reported that marc maiffret  a chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm beyondtrust  is prompting hackers to support in raising a         reward for khalil shreateh  on august     maiffret stated that he had already raised        in his efforts  including the        he himself contributed  he and other hackers alike have denounced facebook for refusing shreateh compensation  stated maiffret   he is sitting there in palestine doing this research on a five year old laptop that looks like it is half broken  it s something that might help him out in a big way   facebook representatives have since responded   we will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users   facebook representatives also claimed they d paid out over    million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past        a      study examined the reasons users eventually quit the site  it found the most common reasons were privacy concerns        general dissatisfaction with facebook        negative aspects regarding facebook friends       and the feeling of getting addicted to facebook       facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy  more addicted to the internet and more conscientious        following the release of the facebook iphone app  paper  at the beginning of february       developer company fiftythree sent a correspondence to the social media company regarding its own app  also entitled paper and trademarked in       asking facebook to cease using an app name that they consider their own  in response  facebook stated that it will continue to use the paper title but conceded that it should have informed fiftythree at an earlier point in time  fiftythree articulated its desired outcome in a blog post   there s a simple fix here  we think facebook can apply the same degree of thought they put into the app into building a brand name of their own  an app about stories shouldn t start with someone else s story  facebook should stop using our brand name            on march       judge richard seeborg issued an order approving the class settlement in lane v  facebook  inc      the class action lawsuit arising out of facebook s beacon program     academic and facebook researchers have collaborated to test if the messages people see on facebook can influence their behavior  for instance  in  a    million person experiment in social influence and political mobilization   during the      elections  facebook users were given the opportunity to  tell your friends you voted  by clicking on an  i voted  button  users were    more likely to click the button if it was associated with friends who had already voted        much more controversially  a      study of  emotional contagion through social networks  manipulated the balance of positive and negative messages seen by         facebook users     the researchers concluded that they had found  some of the first experimental evidence to support the controversial claims that emotions can spread throughout a network  though the effect sizes from the manipulations are small          unlike the  i voted  study  which had presumptively beneficial ends and raised few concerns  this study was criticized for both its ethics and methods claims  as controversy about the study grew  adam kramer  a lead author of both studies and member of the facebook data team  defended the work in a facebook update  a few days later  sheryl sandburg  facebook s coo  made a statement while traveling abroad  while at an indian chambers of commerce event in new delhi she stated that  this was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products  and that was what it was  it was poorly communicated and for that communication we apologize  we never meant to upset you          shortly thereafter  on july          usa today reported that the privacy watchdog group electronic privacy information center  epic  had filed a formal complaint with the federal trade claiming that facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent  in its complaint the epic alleged that facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions   at the time of the experiment  facebook did not state in the data use policy that user data would be used for research purposes  facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers         beyond the ethical concerns  other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study s findings  john grohol  writing at psyccentral  argued that despite its title and claims of  emotional contagion   this study did not look at emotions at all  instead  its authors used an application  called  linguistic inquiry and word count  or liwc       that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users  sentiments  he wrote that a shortcoming of the liwc tool is that it does not understand negations  hence  the tweet  i am not happy  would be scored as positive   since the liwc      ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication  so do the researchers   grohol concluded that given these subtleties  the effect size of the findings are little more than a  statistical blip      kramer et al         found a         that s not   percent  that s     th of one percent     decrease in negative words in people s status updates when the number of negative posts on their facebook news feed decreased  do you know how many words you d have to read or write before you ve written one less negative word due to this effect  probably thousands        the consequences of the controversy are pending  be it ftc or court proceedings  but it did prompt an  editorial expression of concern  from its publisher  the proceedings of the national academy of sciences  as well as an blog posting from okcupid that  we experiment on human beings   in september       law professor james grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were  illegal  immoral  and mood altering  and filed notices with the maryland attorney general and cornell institutional review board        in the uk  the study was also criticised by the british psychological society which said  in a letter to the guardian   there has undoubtedly been some degree of harm caused  with many individuals affected by increased levels of negative emotion  with consequent potential economic costs  increase in possible mental health problems and burden on health services  the so called  positive  manipulation is also potentially harmful         facebook has a real name system policy for user profiles  the real name policy stems from the position  that way  you always know who you re connecting with  this helps keep our community safe         facebook s real name system does not allow adopted names or pseudonyms  and in its enforcement has suspended accounts of legitimate users  until the user provides identification indicating the name  facebook representatives have described these incidents as very rare     a user claimed responsibility via the anonymous android and ios app secret for reporting  fake names  which caused user profiles to be suspended  specifically targeting the stage names of drag queens     on october          chris cox  chief product officer at facebook  offered an apology   in the two weeks since the real name policy issues surfaced  we ve had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it  we ve also come to understand how painful this has been  we owe you a better service and a better experience using facebook  and we re going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using facebook as you were         in april       facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on facebook     the company began its push by inviting a select group of british advertising leaders to meet facebook s top executives at an  influencers  summit  in february       facebook has now been involved in campaigns for true blood  american idol  and top gear     news and media outlets such as the washington post     financial times    and abc news    have used aggregated facebook fan data to create various infographics and charts to accompany their articles  in       the beauty pageant miss sri lanka online was run exclusively using facebook        facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways  with its availability on many mobile devices  facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends  relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world  as long as there is access to the internet  it can also unite people with common interests and or beliefs through groups and other pages  and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends because of the widespread reach of its network              recent studies have shown that facebook causes negative effects on self esteem by triggering feelings of envy  with vacation and holiday photos proving to be the largest resentment triggers  other prevalent causes of envy include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty such envious feelings leave people lonely and dissatisfied with their own lives  a joint study by two german universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting facebook  and another study by utah valley university found that college students felt worse about their own lives following an increase in the amount of time spent on facebook              according to professor of psychology susan krauss whitbourne  although facebook has an upside of friending people  there is also the downside of having someone unfriend or reject another person     whitbourne refers to unfriended persons on facebook as victims of estrangement     unfriending someone is seldom a mutual decision and the person often does not know they have been unfriended        facebook s role in the american political process was demonstrated in january       shortly before the new hampshire primary  when facebook teamed up with abc and saint anselm college to allow users to give live feedback about the  back to back  january   republican and democratic debates           charles gibson moderated both debates  held at the dana center for the humanities at saint anselm college  facebook users took part in debate groups organized around specific topics  register to vote  and message questions        over a million people installed the facebook application  us politics on facebook  in order to take part  and the application measured users  responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates     this debate showed the broader community what many young students had already experienced  facebook as a popular and powerful new way to interact and voice opinions  a poll by cbs news  uwire and the chronicle of higher education claimed to illustrate how the  facebook effect  has affected youth voting rates  support by youth of political candidates  and general involvement by the youth population in the      election        in february       a facebook group called  one million voices against farc  organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of colombians marched in protest against the revolutionary armed forces of colombia  better known as the farc  from the group s spanish name      in august       one of north korea s official government websites and the official news agency of the country  uriminzokkiri  joined facebook        during the arab spring many journalists made claims that facebook played a
