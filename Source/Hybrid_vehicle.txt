 a hybrid vehicle is a vehicle that uses two or more distinct power sources to move the vehicle   the term most commonly refers to hybrid electric vehicles  hevs   which combine an internal combustion engine and one or more electric motors  however  other mechanisms to capture and use energy may also be included             power sources for hybrid vehicles include     mopeds  electric bicycles  and even electric kick scooters are a simple form of a hybrid  as power is delivered both via an internal combustion engine or electric motor and the rider s muscles  early prototypes of motorcycles in the late   th century used the same principles to power it up     the first known prototype and publication of an sh bicycle is by augustus kinzel  us patent            in       in      bernie macdonalds conceived the electrilite  sh lightweight vehicle which used power electronics allowing regenerative braking and pedaling while stationary  in      thomas muller designed a  fahrrad mit elektromagnetischem antrieb  in his      diploma thesis and built a functional vehicle  in      j rg blatter and andreas fuchs of berne university of applied sciences built an sh bicycle and in      mounted the system onto a leitra tricycle  european patent ep           in      harald kutzke described his concept of the  active bicycle   the aim is to approach the ideal bicycle weighing nothing and having no drag by electronic compensation  until      fuchs and colleagues built several prototype sh tricycles and quadricycles      hybrid power trains use diesel electric or turbo electric to power railway locomotives  buses  heavy goods vehicles  mobile hydraulic machinery  and ships  typically some form of heat engine  usually diesel  drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump which powers one or more electric or hydraulic motors  there are advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements especially when multiple drives e g  driven wheels or propellers are required  there is power lost in the double conversion from typically diesel fuel to electricity to power an electric or hydraulic motor  with large vehicles the advantages often outweigh the disadvantages especially as the conversion losses typically decrease with size  with the exception of non nuclear submarines  presently there is no or relatively little secondary energy storage capacity on most heavy vehicles  e g  auxiliary batteries and hydraulic accumulators although this is now changing  submarines are one of the oldest widespread applications of hybrid technology  running on diesel engines while surfaced and switching to battery power when submerged  both series hybrid and parallel hybrid drivetrains were used in the second world war     europenthe new autorail   grande capacit   agc or high capacity railcar  built by the canadian company bombardier for service in france  this has dual mode  diesel and electric motors  and dual voltage capabilities       and       v  allowing it to be used on many different rail systems   the locomotive has been on trials in rotterdam  the netherlands with railfeeding  a genesse and wyoming company     chinanthe first hybrid evaluating prototype locomotive was designed and contracted by rail research center matrai in      and the sample was ready in       it was a g   locomotive that was converted to hybrid by using a    kw diesel generator and batteries and also was equipped with   ac traction motors  out of    retrofitted in the cover of the dc traction motors     japannthe first operational prototype of a hybrid train engine with significant energy storage and energy regeneration capability was introduced in japan as the kiha e     it utilizes battery packs of lithium ion batteries mounted on the roof to store recovered energy      north americanin the us  general electric introduced a prototype railroad engine with their  ecomagination  technology in       they store energy in a large set of sodium nickel chloride  na nicl   batteries to capture and store energy normally dissipated in dynamic braking or coasting downhill  they expect at least a     reduction in fuel use with this system and are now spending no more than    billion yr on hybrid research      variants of the typical diesel electric locomotive include the green goat  gg  and green kid  gk  switching yard engines built by canada s railpower technologies  they utilize a large set of heavy duty long life      yr  rechargeable lead acid  pba  batteries and      to      hp electric motors as the primary motive sources and a new clean burning diesel generator       hp  for recharging the batteries that is used only as needed  no power or fuel are wasted for idling typically        of the time for these type locomotives  it is unclear if dynamic braking  regenerative  power is recaptured for reuse  but in principle it should be easily utilized     since these engines typical need extra weight for traction purposes anyway the battery pack s weight is a negligible penalty  in addition the diesel generator and battery package are normally built on an existing  retired   yard  locomotive s frame for significant additional cost savings  the existing motors and running gear are all rebuilt and reused  diesel fuel savings of        and up to     pollution reductions are claimed over that of a  typical  older switching yard engine  the same advantages that existing hybrid cars have for use with frequent starts and stops and idle periods apply to typical switching yard use     green goat  locomotives have been purchased by canadian pacific railway  bnsf railway  kansas city southern railway  and union pacific railroad among others     railpower technologies engineers working with tsi terminal systems are testing a hybrid diesel electric power unit with battery storage for use in rubber tyred gantry  rtg  cranes  rtg cranes are typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers onto trains or trucks in ports and container storage yards  the energy used to lift the containers can be partially regained when they are lowered  diesel fuel and emission reductions of        are predicted by railpower engineers    first systems are expected to be operational in            early hybrid systems are being investigated for trucks and other heavy highway vehicles with some operational trucks and buses starting to come into use  the main obstacles seem to be smaller fleet sizes and the extra costs of a hybrid system are yet compensated for by fuel savings    but with the price of oil set to continue on its upward trend  the tipping point may be reached by the end of       dated info advances in technology and lowered battery cost and higher capacity etc  developed in the hybrid car industry are already filtering into truck use as toyota  ford  gm and others introduce hybrid pickups and suvs  kenworth truck company recently introduced a hybrid electric truck  called the kenworth t    class   that for city usage seems to be competitive      fedex and others are starting to invest in hybrid delivery type vehicles particularly for city use where hybrid technology may pay off first    as of december     update fedex is trialling two delivery trucks retrofitted with wrightspeed electric powertrains  with diesel powered generators  the retrofit kits are claimed to pay for themselves in a few years  the diesel engines run at a constant rpm to run at peak efficiency       since       the us military has been testing serial hybrid humvees     and have found them to deliver faster acceleration  a stealth mode with low thermal signature  near silent operation  and greater fuel economy     ships with both mast mounted sails and steam engines were an early form of hybrid vehicle  another example is the diesel electric submarine  this runs on batteries when submerged and the batteries can be re charged by the diesel engine when the craft is on the surface     newer hybrid ship propulsion schemes include large towing kites manufactured by companies such as skysails  towing kites can fly at heights several times higher than the tallest ship masts  capturing stronger and steadier winds     the boeing fuel cell demonstrator airplane has a proton exchange membrane  pem  fuel cell lithium ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor  which is coupled to a conventional propeller  the fuel cell provides all power for the cruise phase of flight  during takeoff and climb  the flight segment that requires the most power  the system draws on lightweight lithium ion batteries     the demonstrator aircraft is a dimona motor glider  built by diamond aircraft industries of austria  which also carried out structural modifications to the aircraft  with a wing span of      meters     feet   the airplane will be able to cruise at about    miles per hour     xa km h  on power from the fuel cell       hybrid fanwings have been designed  a fanwing is created by two engines with the capability to autorotate and landing like a helicopter       when the term hybrid vehicle is used  it most often refers to a hybrid electric vehicle  these encompass such vehicles as the saturn vue  toyota prius  toyota yaris  toyota camry hybrid  ford escape hybrid  toyota highlander hybrid  honda insight  honda civic hybrid  lexus rx    h and    h and others  a petroleum electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines  generally gasoline or diesel engines  powered by a variety of fuels  and electric batteries to power the vehicle  there are many types of petroleum electric hybrid drivetrains  from full hybrid to mild hybrid  which offer varying advantages and disadvantages   not in citation given    henri pieper in      developed the first petro electric hybrid automobile in the world  in       ferdinand porsche developed a series hybrid using two motor in wheel hub arrangements with a combustion generator set providing the electric power  setting two speed records citation needed while liquid fuel electric hybrids date back to the late   th century  the braking regenerative hybrid was invented by david arthurs  an electrical engineer from springdale  arkansas in          his home converted opel gt was reported to return as much as   mpg with plans still sold to this original design  and the  mother earth news  modified version on their website       the plug in electric vehicle  pev  is becoming more and more common  it has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services  the batteries can be plugged into house  mains  electricity for charging  as well being charged while the engine is running     given suitable infrastructure  permissions and vehicles  bevs can be recharged while the user drives  the bev establishes contact with an electrified rail  plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism  see conduit current collection   the bev s batteries are recharged by this process on the highway and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged  some of battery electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the london underground are capable of this mode of operation  power is picked up from the electtrified rails where possible  switching to battery power where the electricity supply is disconnected     this provides the advantage  in principle  of virtually unrestricted highway range as long as you stay where you have bev infrastructure access  since many destinations are within    xa km of a major highway  this may reduce the need for expensive battery systems  unfortunately private use of the existing electrical system is nearly universally prohibited     the technology for such electrical infrastructure is old and  outside of some cities  is not widely distributed  see conduit current collection  trams  electric rail  trolleys  third rail   updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs can be funded  in principle  by toll revenue  gasoline or other taxes     in addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for propulsion  some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types   fuels   using the same engine to be hybrids  although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms  these are perhaps more correctly described as dual mode vehicles     hydraulic hybrid and pneumatic hybrid vehicles use an engine to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via hydraulic  liquid  or pneumatic  compressed air  drive units  in most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain  serving solely to charge the energy accumulator  the transmission is seamless  regenerative breaking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator     a french company  mdi  has designed and has running models of a petro air hybrid engine car  the system does not use air motors to drive the vehicle  being directly driven by a hybrid engine  the engine uses a mixture of compressed air and gasoline injected into the cylinders    a key aspect of the hybrid engine is the  active chamber   which is a compartment heating air via fuel doubling the energy output    tata motors of india assessed the design phase towards full production for the indian market and moved into  completing detailed development of the compressed air engine into specific vehicle and stationary applications          petro hydraulic configurations have been common in trains and heavy vehicles for decades  the auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles     in petro hydraulic hybrids  the energy recovery rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than battery charged hybrids using the current battery technology  demonstrating a     to     increase in energy economy in us environmental protection agency  epa  testing    the charging engine needs only to be sized for average usage with acceleration bursts using the stored energy in the hydraulic accumulator  which is charged when in low energy demanding vehicle operation  the charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity  under tests undertaken by the us environmental protection agency  epa   a hydraulic hybrid ford expedition returned    miles per us gallon     xa l    xa km    xa mpg imp  city  and    miles per us gallon    xa l    xa km    xa mpg imp  highway      ups currently has two trucks in service with this technology       although petro hybrid technology has been known for decades  and used in trains and very large construction vehicles  heavy costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars  in the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro hybrid road vehicles in       a group of students at minneapolis  minnesota s hennepin vocational technical center  converted a volkswagen beetle car to run as a petro hydraulic hybrid using off the shelf components  a car rated at   mpg was returning   mpg with the   hp engine replaced by   hp engine  the experimental car reached   xa mph       in the     s  a team of engineers working at epa s national vehicle and fuel emissions laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical american sedan car  the test car achieved over    mpg on combined epa city highway driving cycles  acceleration was     xa mph in   seconds  using a     liter diesel engine  no lightweight materials were used the epa estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only      to the base cost of the vehicle       while the petro hydraulic system has faster and more efficient charge discharge cycling and is cheaper than petro electric hybrids  the accumulator size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than a battery set     research is underway in large corporations and small companies  focus has now switched to smaller vehicles  the system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars  a drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load  a british company  artemis intelligent power  has made a breakthrough by introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor pump  the digital displacement  motor pump  that is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads  making small applications of petro hydraulic hybrids feasible    the company converted a bmw car as a test bed to prove viability  the bmw    i  gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car  this test was using the standard      cc engine  the design of petro hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators entails downsizing an engine to average power usage  not peak power usage  peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator  a smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator       current vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine transmission setups  it is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups  one research project s goal is to create a blank paper design new car  to maximize the packaging of petro hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle  all bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car  one design has claimed to return    mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car  the small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw back kinetic braking energy  the hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes  mechanical transmissions  drive shafts and u joints  reducing costs and weight  hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles    the aim is    mpg in average driving conditions  energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator  a small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator  the accumulator is sized at running the car for    minutes when fully charged  the aim is a fully charged accumulator which will produce a     xa mph acceleration speed of under   seconds using four wheel drive           in january      industry giant chrysler announced a partnership with the us environmental protection agency  epa  to design and develop an experimental petro hydraulic hybrid powertrain suitable for use in large passenger cars  in      an existing production minvan will be adapted to the new hydraulic powertrain             psa peugeot citro n exhibited an experimental  hybrid air  engine at the      geneva motor show    the vehicle uses nitrogen gas compressed by energy harvested from braking or deceleration to power a hydraulic drive which supplements power from its conventional gasoline engine  the hydraulic and electronic components were supplied by robert bosch gmbh  production versions priced at about                   are scheduled for      or       mileage was estimated to be about    miles per gallon for city driving if installed in a citro n c        another form of hybrid vehicle are human power electric vehicles  these include such vehicles as the sinclair c   twike  electric bicycles  and electric skateboards     in a parallel hybrid vehicle  the single electric motor and the internal combustion engine are installed such that they can power the vehicle either individually or together  in contrast to the power split configuration typically only one electric motor is installed  most commonly the internal combustion engine  the electric motor and gear box are coupled by automatically controlled clutches  for electric driving the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gear box is engaged  while in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed     the first mass production parallel hybrid sold outside japan was the  st generation honda insight     these types use a generally compact electric motor  usually    xa kw  to provide auto stop start features and to provide extra power assist   during the acceleration  and to generate on the deceleration phase  aka regenerative braking      on road examples include honda civic hybrid  honda insight  nd generation  honda cr z  honda accord hybrid  mercedes benz s    bluehybrid  bmw   series hybrids  general motors bas hybrids  and smart fortwo with micro hybrid drive     passenger car installations include toyota prius  ford escape and fusion  as well as lexus rx   h  rx   h  gs   h  ls   h  and ct   h     in a power split hybrid electric drive train there are two motors  an electric motor and an internal combustion engine  the power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power splitter  which is a simple planetary gear set  the ratio can be from        for the combustion engine  or        for the electric motor  or anything in between  such as     for the electric motor and     for the combustion engine  the combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries     modern versions such as the toyota hybrid synergy drive have a second electric motor generator on the output shaft  connected to the wheels   in cooperation with the  primary  motor generator and the mechanical power split this provides a continuously variable transmission     on the open road  the primary power source is the internal combustion engine  when maximum power is required  for example to overtake  the electric motor is used to assist  this increases the available power for a short period  giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed  in most applications  the engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary reducing curbside emissions     a series  or serial hybrid vehicle is driven by an electric motor  functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient  with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient  there is no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels  and the purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery    series hybrids have also been referred to as extended range electric vehicle or range extended electric vehicle  erev reev   though range extension can be accomplished with parallel hybrid layouts     the bmw i  with range extender is the first production series hybrid  it operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low  and then activates the generator to maintain power  and is also available without the range extender  the fisker karma was also a series hybrid     when describing cars  the battery of a series hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in   but technically a series hybrid allows for a battery to only act as a buffer  and for regeneration purposes   and for the electric motor s power to be supplied constantly by the supporting engine  series arrangements have been common in diesel electric locomotives and ships  ferdinand porsche effectively invented this arrangement in racing cars in the early   th century  with porsche naming the arrangement  system mixt    a wheel hub motor arrangement  with a motor in each of the two front wheels was used  setting speed records  this arrangement was sometimes referred to as an electric transmission  as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission  the vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running     in      toyota released the first series hybrid bus sold in japan    gm introduced the chevy volt series plug in hybrid in       aiming for an all electric range of   xa mi    xa km     though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain  supercapacitors combined with a lithium ion battery bank have been used by afs trinity in a converted saturn vue suv vehicle  using supercapacitors they claim up to     mpg in a series hybrid arrangement       another subtype of hybrid vehicles is the plug in hybrid electric vehicle  phev   the plug in hybrid is usually a general fuel electric  parallel or serial  hybrid with increased energy storage capacity  usually through a li ion battery  which allows the vehicle to drive on all electric mode a distance that depends on the battery size and its mechanical layout  series or parallel   it may be connected to mains electricity supply at the end of the journey to avoid charging using the on board internal combustion engine         this concept is attractive to those seeking to minimize on road emissions by avoiding   or at least minimizing   the use of ice during daily driving  as with pure electric vehicles  the total emissions saving  for example in co  terms  is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company     for some users  this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol diesel that they would have otherwise used  current tax systems in many european countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source  this is generally not the case for electricity  which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer  however that person uses it  some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off peak night users  which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug in option for commuters and urban motorists     a      national highway traffic safety administration report examined hybrid electric vehicle accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving internal combustion engine vehicles  icev   the findings showed that  in certain road situations  hevs are more dangerous for those on foot or bicycle  for accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping  backing up  entering or leaving a parking space  when the sound difference between hevs and icevs is most pronounced   hevs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than icevs  for crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians  there was a higher incident rate for hevs than icevs when a vehicle was turning a corner  but there was no statistically significant difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight       several automakers developed electric vehicle warning sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicle  plug in hybrid electric vehicles and all electric vehicles  evs  travelling at low speeds  their purpose is to make pedestrians  cyclists  the blind  and others aware of the vehicle s presence while operating in all electric mode             vehicles in the market with such safety devices include the nissan leaf  chevrolet volt  fisker karma  honda fcx clarity  nissan fuga hybrid infiniti m    hyundai ix   fcev  hyundai sonata hybrid       honda fit ev  the      toyota camry hybrid       lexus ct   h  and all prius family cars recently introduced  including the standard      model year prius  the toyota prius v  and the toyota prius plug in hybrid     the hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles  icevs   resulting in fewer emissions being generated  these savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design     other techniques that are not necessarily  hybrid  features  but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include     these features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops  coasting and idling periods  in addition noise emissions are reduced  particularly at idling and low operating speeds  in comparison to conventional engine vehicles  for continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions     hybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the epa  environmental protection agency   the recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to     metric tons of carbon dioxide  the three most popular hybrid vehicles  honda civic  honda insight and toyota prius  set the standards even higher by producing           and     tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions  hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog forming pollutants by up to     and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half       though hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars  there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery  today most hybrid car batteries are one of two types     nickel metal hydride  or    lithium ion  both are regarded as more environmentally friendly than lead based batteries which constitute the bulk of petrol car starter batteries today  there are many types of batteries  some are far more toxic than others  lithium ion is the least toxic of the two mentioned above       the toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteries the type currently used in hybrids are much lower than batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium    in general various soluble and insoluble nickel compounds  such as nickel chloride and nickel oxide  have known carcinogenic effects in chick embryos and rats        the main nickel compound in nimh batteries is nickel oxyhydroxide  niooh   which is used as the positive electrode     the lithium ion battery has attracted attention due to its potential for use in hybrid electric vehicles  hitachi is a leader in its development    in addition to its smaller size and lighter weight  lithium ion batteries deliver performance that helps to protect the environment with features such as improved charge efficiency without memory effect  the lithium ion batteries are appealing because they have the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage more than three times that of nickel metal hydride battery cell while simultaneously storing large quantities of electricity as well  the batteries also produce higher output  boosting vehicle power   higher efficiency  avoiding wasteful use of electricity   and provides excellent durability  compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle  additionally  use of lithium ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of     better than petro powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in co  emissions helping to prevent global warming        the optimum charging window for lithium ion batteries is       v  recharging with a     volt household outlet takes several hours  a     volt charger takes     hours  and a quick charge takes approximately    minutes to achieve     charge    important factors distance on charge  cost of charging  and time to charge    in order for the hybrid to run on electrical power  the car must perform the action of braking in order to generate some electricity  the electricity then gets discharged most effectively when the car accelerates or climbs up an incline  in       hybrid electric car batteries can run on solely electricity for        miles on a single charge  hybrid battery capacity currently ranges from     kwh to    kwh on a fully electric car  on a hybrid car  the battery packs currently range from     kwh to     kwh representing a large difference in use of electricity in hybrid cars       there is an impending increase in the costs of many rare materials used in the manufacture of hybrid cars    for example  the rare earth element dysprosium is required to fabricate many of the advanced electric motors and battery systems in hybrid propulsion systems      neodymium is another rare earth metal which is a crucial ingredient in high strength magnets that are found in permanent magnet electric motors       nearly all the rare earth elements in the world come from china    and many analysts believe that an overall increase in chinese electronics manufacturing will consume this entire supply by         in addition  export quotas on chinese rare earth elements have resulted in an unknown amount of supply         a few non chinese sources such as the advanced hoidas lake project in northern canada as well as mount weld in australia are currently under development    however  the barriers to entry are high   and require years to go online     other types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than fossil fuel  another option is to use alternative fuel composition  i e  biofuels  in conventional fossil fuel based vehicles  making them go partly on renewable energy sources     other approaches include personal rapid transit  a public transportation concept that offers automated on demand non stop transportation  on a network of specially built guideways     peugeot and citro n have announced that they too are building a car that uses compressed air as an energy source  however  the car they are designing uses a hybrid system which also uses a gasoline engine  which is used for propelling the car over   xa km h  or when the compressed air tank has been depleted       automakers spend around  us  million in marketing hybrid vehicles each year  with combined effort from many car companies  the hybrid industry has sold millions of hybrids citation needed hybrid car companies like toyota  honda  ford and bmw have pulled together to create a movement of hybrid vehicle sales pushed by washington lobbyist to lower the worlds emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumption citation needed in       sales went beyond         hybrids  but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by         gallons per day   a tiny fraction of the     million gallons used per day citation needed according to bradley berman author of driving change one hybrid at a time   cold economics shows that in real dollars  except for a brief spike in the     s  gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap  fuel continues to represent a small part of the overall cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle     other marketing tactics include greenwashing which is the  unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue     temma ehrenfeld explained in an article by newsweek  hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate  hybrid car companies have a long time to go if they expect to really go green  according to harvard business professor theodore levitt states  managing products  and  meeting customers  needs    you must adapt to consumer expectations and anticipation of future desires     this means people buy what they want  if they want a fuel efficient car they buy a hybrid without thinking about the actual efficiency of the product  this  green myopia  as ottman calls it  fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness  researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology  as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups  secondly  people find it rewarding to own the better  newer  flashier  and so called greener car  in the beginning of the hybrid movement car companies reached out to the young people  by using top celebrities  astronauts  and popular tv shows to market hybrids  this made the new technology of hybrids a status to obtain for many people and a must to be cool or even the practical choice for the time  with the many benefits and status of owning a hybrid it is easy to think it s the right thing to do  but in fact may not be as green as it appears citation needed    while the adoption rate for hybrids in the us is small today       of new car sales in          this compares with a       share of new car sales in japan in         and it has the potential to be very large over time as more models are offered and incremental costs decline due to learning and scale benefits  however  forecasts vary widely  for instance  bob lutz  a long time skeptic of hybrids  indicated he expects hybrids  will never comprise more than     of the us auto market     other sources also expect hybrid penetration rates in the us will remain under     for many years           more optimistic views include predictions that hybrids would dominate new car sales in the us and elsewhere over the next    to    years    another approach examines the penetration rates  or s curves  of four analogs  historical and current  to hybrid and electrical vehicles in an attempt to gauge how quickly the vehicle stock could be hybridized and or electrified in the united states  the analogs are     the electric motors in us factories in the early   th century      diesel electric locomotives on us railways in the           period      a range of new automotive features technologies introduced in the us over the past fifty years  and    e bike purchases in china over the past few years  these analogs collectively suggest it would take at least    years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture     of the us passenger vehicle stock        the european parliament  council and european commission has reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average co  passenger car emissions to   g km by       according to a european commission press release     according to the release  the key details of the agreement are as follows     emissions target  the agreement will reduce average co  emissions from new cars to    g km from       as proposed by the commission  this is a     reduction from the mandatory      target of     g km  the target is an average for each manufacturer s new car fleet  it allows oems to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more       target  the commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by end      to take effect in       this target will be in line with the eu s long term climate goals  supercredits for low emission vehicles  the regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with co  emissions of    g km or less  which will be electric or plug in hybrid cars   each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in            in            in      and then as one vehicle from      onwards  these supercredits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet  however  to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation  there will be a     g km cap per manufacturer on the contribution that supercredits can make to their target in any year
