 a single board computer  sbc  is a complete computer built on a single circuit board  with microprocessor s   memory  input output  i o  and other features required of a functional computer  single board computers were made as demonstration or development systems  for educational systems  or for use as embedded computer controllers  many types of home computer or portable computer integrated all their functions onto a single printed circuit board     unlike a desktop personal computer  single board computers often did not rely on expansion slots for peripheral functions or expansion  some single board computers are made to plug into a backplane for system expansion  single board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors  simple designs  such as built by computer hobbyists  often use static ram and low cost eight or    bit processors  other types  such as blade servers  include all the memory and processor performance of a server computer in a compact space saving format             the first true single board computer  see the may      issue of radio electronics  called the  dyna micro  was based on the intel c    a  and also used intel s first eprom  the c    a  the dyna micro was re branded by e l instruments of derby  ct in      as the  mmd     mini micro designer    and was made famous as the example microcomputer in the very popular       bugbook  series of the time  sbcs also figured heavily in the early history of home computers  for example in the acorn electron and the bbc micro  other typical early single board computers like the kim   were often shipped without enclosure  which had to be added by the owner  other examples are the ferguson big board and the nascom  with the development of pcs there was a sharp shift away from sbc  with computers being constructed from a motherboard  with functions like serial ports  disk drive controller and graphics being provided on daughterboards  the recent availability of advanced chip sets providing most of the i o features as embedded components allows motherboard manufacturers to offer motherboards with i o traditionally provided by daughterboards  most pc motherboards now offer on board support for disk drives including ide and sata with raid  graphics  ethernet  and traditional i o such as serial and parallel ports  usb  and keyboard mouse support  plug in cards are now more commonly high performance graphics cards  really graphics co processors   high end raid controllers  and specialized i o cards such as data acquisition and dsp  digital signal processor  boards     single board computers were made possible by increasing density of integrated circuits  a single board configuration reduces a system s overall cost  by reducing the number of circuit boards required  and by eliminating connectors and bus driver circuits that would otherwise be used  by putting all the functions on one board  a smaller overall system can be obtained  for example  as in notebook computers  connectors are a frequent source of reliability problems  so a single board system eliminates these problems       single board computers are now commonly defined across two distinct architectures  no slots and slot support     embedded sbcs are units providing all the required i o with no provision for plug in cards  applications are typically gaming  slot machines  video poker   kiosk  and machine control  embedded sbcs are much smaller than the atx type motherboard found in pcs  and provide an i o mix more targeted to an industrial application  such as on board digital and analog i o  on board bootable flash memory  eliminating the need for a disk drive   no video  etc     the term  single board computer  now generally applies to an architecture where the single board computer is plugged into a backplane to provide for i o cards  in the case of pc     the bus is not a backplane in the traditional sense but is a series of pin connectors allowing i o boards to be stacked     single board computers are most commonly used in industrial situations where they are used in rackmount format for process control or embedded within other devices to provide control and interfacing  because of the very high levels of integration  reduced component counts and reduced connector counts  sbcs are often smaller  lighter  more power efficient and more reliable than comparable multi board computers     the primary advantage of an atx motherboard as compared to an sbc is cost  motherboards are manufactured by the millions for the consumer and office markets allowing tremendous economies of scale  single board computers  on the other hand  are in a specialized market niche and are manufactured in much smaller numbers with the resultant higher cost  motherboards and sbcs now offer similar levels of feature integration meaning that a motherboard failure in either standard will require equivalent replacement     the primary advantage of a picmg single board computer is the availability of backplanes offering virtually any slot configuration including legacy isa support  motherboards tend to the latest slot technology such that pci slots are becoming legacy support with pci express becoming the standard  in addition  motherboards offer  at most    slots while backplanes can offer up to    slots  in a backplane       wide  similar in size to an atx motherboard at      a backplane with a single board computer can offer    slots for i o cards with virtually any mix of slot types      one common variety of single board computer uses standardized form factors intended for use in a backplane enclosure  some of these types are compactpci  pxi  vmebus  vxi  and picmg  sbcs have been built around various internal processing structures including the intel architecture  multiprocessing architectures  and lower power processing systems like risc and sparc  in the intel pc world  the intelligence and interface control circuitry is placed on a plug in board that is then inserted into a passive  or active  backplane  the end result is similar to having a system built with a motherboard  except that the backplane determines the slot configuration  backplanes are available with a mix of slots  isa  pci  pcix  pci express  etc    usually totaling    or fewer  meaning it will fit in a     rackmount enclosure      wide chassis      some single board computers have connectors which allow a stack of circuit boards  each containing expansion hardware  to be assembled without a traditional backplane  examples of stacking sbc form factors include pc      pc     plus  pci      epic  and ebx  these systems are commonly available for use in embedded control systems     picmg provides standards for the backplane interface  picmg          and      provide for isa and pci support with     adding pcix support  picmg       provides for pci express support  single board computers meeting the picmg     specification are referred to as a system host board  shb      stack type sbcs often have memory provided on plug cards such as simms and dimms  hard drive circuit boards are also not counted for determining if a computer is an sbc or not for two reasons  firstly because the hdd is regarded as a single block storage unit  and secondly because the sbc may not require a hard drive at all as most can be booted from their network connections
