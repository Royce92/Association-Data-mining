 mainframe computers  colloquially referred to as  big iron    are computers used primarily by corporate and governmental organizations for critical applications  bulk data processing such as census  industry and consumer statistics  enterprise resource planning and transaction processing     the term originally referred to the large cabinets called  main frames  that housed the central processing unit and main memory of early computers    later  the term was used to distinguish high end commercial machines from less powerful units   most large scale computer system architectures were established in the     s  but continue to evolve             modern mainframe design is generally less defined by single task computational speed  typically defined as mips rate or flops in the case of floating point calculations   and more by     their high stability and reliability enables these machines to run uninterrupted for decades     software upgrades usually require setting up the operating system or portions thereof  and are non disruptive only when using virtualizing facilities such as ibm s z os and parallel sysplex  or unisys s xpcl  which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another s application while it is being refreshed  mainframes are defined by high availability  one of the main reasons for their longevity  since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic  the term reliability  availability and serviceability  ras  is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers  proper planning and implementation is required to exploit these features  and if improperly implemented  may serve to inhibit the benefits provided  in addition  mainframes are more secure than other computer types  the nist vulnerabilities database  us cert  rates traditional mainframes such as ibm zseries  unisys dorado and unisys libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for windows  unix  and linux      in the late     s  most mainframes had no explicitly interactive interface  they accepted sets of punched cards  paper tape  or magnetic tape to transfer data and programs  they operated in batch mode to support back office functions  such as customer billing  and supported interactive terminals almost exclusively for applications rather than program development  typewriter and teletype devices were also common control consoles for system operators through the     s  although ultimately supplanted by keyboard display devices  by the early     s  many mainframes acquired interactive user interfacesnb   and operated as timesharing computers  supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing  users gained access through specialized terminals or  later  from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software  by the     s  many mainframes supported graphical terminals  and terminal emulation  but not graphical user interfaces  this format of end user computing reached mainstream obsolescence in the     s due to the advent of personal computers provided with guis  after       most modern mainframes have partially or entirely phased out classic  green screen  terminal access for end users in favour of web style user interfaces     the infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid     s when cmos mainframe designs replaced the older bipolar technology  ibm claimed that its newer mainframes could reduce data center energy costs for power and cooling  and that they could reduce physical space requirements compared to server farms      modern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time  this technique of virtual machines allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers  in this role  a single mainframe can replace higher functioning hardware services available to conventional servers  while mainframes pioneered this capability  virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems  though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication citation needed    mainframes can add or hot swap system capacity without disrupting system function  with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions citation needed modern mainframes  notably the ibm zseries  system z  and system z   servers  offer two levels of virtualization  logical partitions  lpars  via the pr sm facility  and virtual machines  via the z vm operating system   many mainframe customers run two machines  one in their primary data center  and one in their backup data center fully active  partially active  or on standby in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building  test  development  training  and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine  except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting  such a two mainframe installation can support continuous business service  avoiding both planned and unplanned outages  in practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by parallel sysplex and shared dasd  in ibm s case  citation needed or with shared  geographically dispersed storage provided by emc or hitachi     mainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output  i o  and emphasize throughput computing  since the late     s nb   mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardwarenb    called channels or peripheral processors  which manage the i o devices  leaving the cpu free to deal only with high speed memory  it is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive databases and files  gigabyte to terabyte size record files are not unusual   compared to a typical pc  mainframes commonly have hundreds to thousands of times as much data storage online  and can access it much faster citation needed other server families also offload i o processing and emphasize throughput computing     mainframe return on investment  roi   like any other computing platform  is dependent on its ability to scale  support mixed workloads  reduce labor costs  deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications  and several other risk adjusted cost factors     mainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for fault tolerant computing  for example  z     z     system z   and system z   servers effectively execute result oriented instructions twice  compare results  arbitrate between any differences  through instruction retry and failure isolation   then shift workloads  in flight  to functioning processors  including spares  without any impact to operating systems  applications  or users  this hardware level feature  also found in hp s nonstop systems  is known as lock stepping  because both processors take their  steps   i e  instructions  together  not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide  but many do  such as financial transaction processing citation needed    ibm mainframes dominate the mainframe market at well over     market share   unisys manufactures clearpath libra mainframes  based on earlier burroughs products and clearpath dorado mainframes based on sperry univac os      product lines  in       hitachi co developed the zseries z    with ibm to share expenses  but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new hitachi models  hewlett packard sells its unique nonstop systems  which it acquired with tandem computers and which some analysts classify as mainframes  groupe bull s dps  fujitsu  formerly siemens  bs      and fujitsu icl vme mainframes are still available in europe  fujitsu  hitachi  and nec  the  jcms   still maintain mainframe hardware businesses in the japanese market        the amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share  fujitsu and hitachi both continue to use custom s     compatible processors  as well as other cpus  including power and xeon  for lower end systems  bull uses a mixture of itanium and xeon processors  nec uses xeon processors for its low end acos   line  but develops the custom noah   processor for its high end acos   series  ibm continues to pursue a different business strategy of mainframe investment and growth citation needed ibm has its own large research and development organization designing new  homegrown cpus  including mainframe processors such as      s    xa ghz six core zec   mainframe microprocessor  unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet sized mainframes that utilize homegrown cpus as well as xeon processors  ibm is rapidly expanding its software business  including its mainframe software portfolio  to seek additional revenue and profits       furthermore  there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations  in addition to ibm  significant players in this market include bmc    compuware      and ca technologies       several manufacturers produced mainframe computers from the late     s through the     s  the group of manufacturers was first known as  ibm and the seven dwarfs     p    usually burroughs  univac  ncr  control data  honeywell  general electric and rca  although some lists varied  later  with the departure of general electric and rca  it was referred to as ibm and the bunch  ibm s dominance grew out of their          series and  later  the development of the     series mainframes  the latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zseries mainframes which  along with the then burroughs and sperry  now unisys  mcp based and os     mainframes  are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period  while ibm s zseries can still run    bit system     code  the    bit zseries and system z  cmos servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems  notable manufacturers outside the usa were siemens and telefunken in germany  icl in the united kingdom  olivetti in italy  and fujitsu  hitachi  oki  and nec in japan  the soviet union and warsaw pact countries manufactured close copies of ibm mainframes during the cold war  the besm series and strela are examples of an independently designed soviet computer     shrinking demand and tough competition started a shakeout in the market in the early     s   rca sold out to univac and ge sold its business to honeywell  in the     s honeywell was bought out by bull  univac became a division of sperry  which later merged with burroughs to form unisys corporation in          during the     s  minicomputer based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower end of the mainframes  these computers  sometimes called departmental computers were typified by the dec vax     in       at t corporation briefly owned ncr  during the same period  companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the it policies and practices at that time  terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by personal computers  consequently  demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government  in the early     s  there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks  infoworld s stewart alsop famously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in       in       he cited cheryl currid  a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe  will stop working on december              a reference to the anticipated year      problem  y k      that trend started to turn around in the late     s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world  encouraging trends toward more centralized computing  the growth of e business also dramatically increased the number of back end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases  batch processing  such as billing  became even more important  and larger  with the growth of e business  and mainframes are particularly adept at large scale batch computing  another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the linux operating system  which arrived on ibm mainframe systems in      and is typically run in scores or hundreds of virtual machines on a single mainframe  linux allows users to take advantage of open source software combined with mainframe hardware ras  rapid expansion and development in emerging markets  particularly people s republic of china  is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems  e g  providing unified  extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for   billion consumers across multiple industries  banking  insurance  credit reporting  government services  etc   in late      ibm introduced    bit z architecture  acquired numerous software companies such as cognos and introduced those software products to the mainframe  ibm s quarterly and annual reports in the     s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments  however  ibm s mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects  for example  in the  th quarter of       ibm s system z hardware revenues decreased by     year over year  but mips shipments  a measure of mainframe capacity  increased    per year over the past two years    alsop had himself photographed in       symbolically eating his own words   death of the mainframe         in       nasa powered down its last mainframe  an ibm system z     however  ibm s successor to the z   the z    led a new york times reporter to state four years earlier that  mainframe technology   hardware  software and services   remains a large and lucrative business for i b m   and mainframes are still the back office engines behind the world s financial markets and much of global commerce     as of     update  while mainframe technology represented less than    of ibm s revenues  it  continued to play an outsized role in big blue s results        a supercomputer is a computer that is at the frontline of current processing capacity  particularly speed of calculation  supercomputers are used for scientific and engineering problems  high performance computing  which are data crunching and number crunching    while mainframes are used for transaction processing  the differences are as follows     in         an amalgamation of the different technologies and architectures for supercomputers and mainframes has led to the so called gameframe
