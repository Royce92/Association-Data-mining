 in the context of computer operating systems  a volume or logical drive is a single accessible storage area with a single file system  typically  though not necessarily  resident on a single partition of a hard disk  although a volume might be different from a physical disk drive  it can still be accessed with an operating system s logical interface  however  a volume differs from a partition  in linux systems  volumes are usually handled by the logical volume manager or the enterprise volume management system and manipulated using mount     in nt based versions of microsoft windows  volumes are handled by the kernel and managed using the disk management mmc snap in or the diskpart command line tool             a volume is not the same thing as a partition  for example  a floppy disk might be accessible as a volume  even though it does not contain a partition  as floppy disks cannot be partitioned with most modern computer software  also  an os can recognize a partition without recognizing any volume associated with it  as when the os cannot interpret the filesystem stored there  this situation occurs  for example  when windows nt based oses encounter disks with non microsoft os partitions  such as the ext  filesystem commonly used with linux  another example occurs in the intel world with the  extended partition   while these are partitions  they cannot contain a filesystem directly  instead   logical drives   aka volumes  must be created within them  this is also the case with netware volumes residing inside of a single partition  in short  volumes exist at the logical os level  and partitions exist at the physical  media specific level  sometimes there is a one to one correspondence  but this is not guaranteed     in microsoft windows server      and onward the term  volume  is used as a superset that includes  partition  as well        it isn t uncommon to see a volume packed into a single file  examples include iso     disc images  cd dvd images  commonly called  isos    and installer volumes for mac os x  dmgs   as these volumes are files which reside within another volume  they certainly are not partitions     this example concerns a windows xp system with two physical hard disks  the first hard disk has two partitions  the second has only one  the first partition of the first hard disk contains the operating system  mount points have been left at defaults     in this example     it is important to note that windows nt based oses do not have a single root folder  as a result  windows will assign at least one path to each mounted volume  which will take one of two forms     in these two examples  a file called  track   mp   stored in the root directory of the mounted volume could be referred to as  f track   mp   or  c musictrack   mp   respectively     in order to assign a mount point for a volume as a path within another volume  the following criteria must be met     by default  windows will assign drive letters to all drives  as follows     because of this legacy convention  the operating system startup drive is still most commonly assigned  c    however this is not always the case  since personal computers now no longer include floppies  and optical disc and other removable drives typically still start at  d    letters a and b are available for manual assignment by a user with administrative privileges  this assignment will be remembered by the same os on the same pc next time a removable volume is inserted  as long as there are no conflicts  and as long as the removable drive has not been reformatted on another computer  which changes its volume serial number   and as long as the os has not been reinstalled on the computer     on windows xp  mount points may be managed through the disk management snap in for the microsoft management console  this can be most conveniently accessed through  computer management  in the  administrative tools  section of the control panel     more than one drive letter can refer to a single volume  as when using the subst command     warning  removing drive letters or mount points for a drive may break some programs  as some files may not be accessible under the known path  for example  if a program is installed at  d program filessome program   it may expect to find its data files at  d program filessome programdata   if the logical disk previously called  d   has its drive letter changed to  e     some program  won t be able to find its data at  d program filessome programdata   since the drive letter  d   no longer represents that volume     in unix like operating systems  volumes other than the boot volume have a mount point somewhere within the filesystem  represented by a path  logically  the directory tree stored on the volume is grafted in at the mountpoint  by convention  mount points will often be placed in a directory called   mnt   though   media  and other terms are sometimes used     as in windows  to use a given path as a mount point for another volume  an empty directory  sometimes called a folder  must exist there     unix like operating systems use the mount command to manipulate mount points for volumes     for example  if a cd rom drive containing a text file called  info txt  was mounted at   mnt iso       the text file would be accessible at   mnt iso     info txt      files within a volume can generally be moved to any other place within that volume by manipulating the filesystem  without moving the actual data  however  if a file is to be moved outside the volume  the data itself must be relocated  which is a much more expensive operation     in order to better visualize this concept  one might consider the example of a large library  if a non fiction work is originally classified as having the subject  plants   but then has to be moved to the subject  flora   one does not need to refile the book  whose position on the shelf would be static  but rather  one needs only to replace the index card  however  to move the book to another library  adjusting index cards alone is insufficient  the entire book must be moved     some filesystems  such as the unix file system  ufs   microsoft s ntfs filesystem  and ext   allow multiple pseudonyms  known as  hard links   to be created for a single file within the same volume  hard links allow a file to be referenced by two separate filenames  without its data being stored in two places on the disk  and thereby consuming twice as much space   hard links cannot be created for files between volumes  this is comparable to moving the file in the library example above  to return to the library analogy  this is like filing two index cards for the same book  one could file the above book under both  flora  and  plants   in general  deleting one hard link does not immediately effect other hard links  while deleting the final hard link for a file frees the disk space occupied by that file  however  modifying the data of the file referred to by one hard link will impact all other hard links as well  in the library  this is comparable to writing in the book  hard links should not be confused with aliases  mac os   shortcuts  windows   or soft links  another type of link under unix and variants   which can refer to files on another volume or no file at all  fat filesystems  such as fat    do not support hard or soft links as such  although the windows operating system supports  links   which are somewhat less capable     a volume label is the name given to a specific volume in a filesystem  in the fat filesystem  the volume label was traditionally restricted to    characters  reflecting the     restrictions  but not divided into name and extension fields  even when long file name was enabled  stored as an entry within a disk s root directory with a special volume label attribute bit set  and also copied to an    byte field within the extended bios parameter block of the disk s boot sector  the label is always stored as uppercase in fat and vfat filesystems  and cannot contain special characters that are also disallowed for regular filenames  in the ntfs filesystem  the length of its volume label is restricted to    characters  and can include lowercase characters and even unicode  the label command is used to change the label in dos  windows  and os    for gui systems like windows explorer  f  can be pressed while the volume is highlighted  or a right click on the name will bring up a context menu that allows it to be renamed  either of which is the same process as for renaming a file  changing the label in windows will also change the volume creation timestamp to the current date and time for fat filesystems  ntfs partitions have the system volume information folder  whose creation timestamp is set when windows creates the partition  or when it first recognizes a repartitioning  the creation of a new volume  by a separate disk utility     in contrast to the label  the volume serial number is generally unique and is not normally changed by the user  and thus acts as a more consistent and reliable identifier of when a volume has been changed  as when a disk is removed and another inserted   disk formatting changes the serial number  but relabeling does not  the vol command can be used from the command line to display the current label and serial number of a volume
