 minisupercomputers constituted a short lived class of computers that emerged in the mid     s  characterized by the combination of vector processing and small scale multiprocessing  as scientific computing using vector processors became more popular  the need for lower cost systems that might be used at the departmental level instead of the corporate level created an opportunity for new computer vendors to enter the market  as a generalization  the price targets for these smaller computers were one tenth of the larger supercomputers     several notable technical  economic  and political attributes characterize minisupercomputers  first  they were architecturally more diverse than prior mainframes and minicomputers in hardware and less diverse in software  second  advances in vlsi made them less expensive  mini price   these machines were market targeted to be cost effective and quickly manufactured  third  it is notable who did not manufacture minisupercomputers  within the usa  ibm and the traditional mainframe makers  outside the usa  the japanese supercomputer vendors and russia  despite attempts to manufacture minicomputers      the appearance of even lower priced scientific workstations based on microprocessors with high performance floating point units  fpus  during the     s  such as the mips r      ibm power    and weitek eroded the demand for this class of computer     the industry magazine datamation coined the term  crayette  which in short order meant instruction set compatible to cray research  inc
