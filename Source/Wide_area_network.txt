 a wide area network  wan  is a network that covers a broad area  i e   any telecommunications network that links across metropolitan  regional  national or international boundaries  using leased telecommunication lines  business and government entities use wans to relay data among employees  clients  buyers  and suppliers from various geographical locations  in essence  this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location  the internet can be considered a wan as well  and is used by businesses  governments  organizations  and individuals for almost any purpose imaginable      related terms for other types of networks are personal area networks  pans   local area networks  lans   campus area networks  cans   or metropolitan area networks  mans  which are usually limited to a room  building  campus or specific metropolitan area  e g   a city  respectively             the textbook definition of a wan is a computer network spanning regions  countries  or even the world  however  in terms of the application of computer networking protocols and concepts  it may be best to view wans as computer networking technologies used to transmit data over long distances  and between different lans  mans and other localised computer networking architectures  this distinction stems from the fact that common lan technologies operating at layer      such as the forms of ethernet or wifi  are often geared towards physically localised networks  and thus cannot transmit data over tens  hundreds or even thousands of miles or kilometres     wans do not just necessarily connect physically disparate lans  a can  for example  may have a localised backbone of a wan technology  which connects different lans within a campus  this could be to facilitate higher bandwidth applications  or provide better functionality for users in the can     wans are used to connect lans and other types of networks together  so that users and computers in one location can communicate with users and computers in other locations  many wans are built for one particular organization and are private  others  built by internet service providers  provide connections from an organization s lan to the internet  wans are often built using leased lines  at each end of the leased line  a router connects the lan on one side with a second router within the lan on the other  leased lines can be very expensive  instead of using leased lines  wans can also be built using less costly circuit switching or packet switching methods  network protocols including tcp ip deliver transport and addressing functions  protocols including packet over sonet sdh  mpls  atm and frame relay are often used by service providers to deliver the links that are used in wans  x    was an important early wan protocol  and is often considered to be the  grandfather  of frame relay as many of the underlying protocols and functions of x    are still in use today  with upgrades  by frame relay     academic research into wide area networks can be broken down into three areas  mathematical models  network emulation and network simulation     performance improvements are sometimes delivered via wide area file services or wan optimization     several options are available for wan connectivity      transmission rates have increased over time and will continue to increase  around      a    xa bit s  bits per second  line was normal on the edge of the wan  while core links ofxa    kbit s to   xa kbit s were considered  fast   at this moment        households are connected to the internet with adsl or cable at speeds ranging from  xa mbit s to    xa mbit s and the connections in the core of a wan can range from   gbit s to     gbit s     recently with the proliferation of low cost of internet connectivity many companies and organizations have turned to vpn to interconnect their networks  creating a wan in that way  companies such as citrix  cisco  new edge networks and check point offer solutions to create vpn networks
