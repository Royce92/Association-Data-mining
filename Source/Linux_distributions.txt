 a linux distribution  often called a distro for short  is an operating system made as a collection of software based around the linux kernel and often around a package management system  linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading one of the linux distributions  which are available for a wide variety of systems ranging from embedded devices  for example  openwrt  and personal computers to powerful supercomputers  for example  rocks cluster distribution      a typical linux distribution comprises a linux kernel  gnu tools and libraries  additional software  documentation  a window system  the most common being the x window system   a window manager  and a desktop environment  most of the included software is free and open source software made available both as compiled binaries and in source code form  allowing modifications to the original software  usually  linux distributions optionally include some proprietary software that may not be available in source code form  such as binary blobs required for some device drivers   almost all linux distributions are unix like  the most notable exception is android  which does not include a command line interface and programs made for typical linux distributions      a linux distribution may be described as a particular assortment of application and utility software  various gnu tools and libraries  for example   packaged together with the linux kernel in such a way that its capabilities meet the needs of many users   the software is usually adapted to the distribution and then packaged into software packages by the distribution s maintainers  the software packages are available online in so called repositories  which are storage locations usually distributed around the world    beside glue components  such as the distribution installers  for example  debian installer and anaconda  or the package management systems  there are only very few packages that are originally written from the ground up by the maintainers of a linux distribution     more than six hundred linux distributions exist  over three hundred of those are in active development  constantly being revised and improved  because of the huge availability of software  distributions have taken a wide variety of forms  including those suitable for use on desktops  servers  laptops  netbooks  mobile phones and tabletsspecify  as well as minimal environments typically for use in embedded systems    there are commercially backed distributions  such as fedora  red hat   opensuse  suse  and ubuntu  canonical ltd    and entirely community driven distributions  such as debian  slackware  gentoo and arch linux  most distributions come ready to use and pre compiled for a specific instruction set  while some distributions  such as gentoo  are distributed mostly in source code form and compiled locally during installation              linus torvalds developed the linux kernel and distributed its first version        in       linux was initially distributed as source code only  and later as a pair of downloadable floppy disk imagesxa    one bootable and containing the linux kernel itself  and the other with a set of gnu utilities and tools for setting up a file system  since the installation procedure was complicated  especially in the face of growing amounts of available software  distributions sprang up to simplify this       early distributions included the following     the two oldest and still active distribution projects started in       the sls distribution was not well maintained  so in july      a new distribution  called slackware and based on sls  was released by patrick volkerding    also dissatisfied with sls  ian murdock set to create a free distribution by founding debian  which had its first release in december            users were attracted to linux distributions as alternatives to the dos and microsoft windows operating systems on ibm pc compatible computers  mac os on the apple macintosh  and proprietary versions of unix  most early adopters were familiar with unix from work or school  they embraced linux distributions for their low  if any  cost  and availability of the source code for most or all of the software included     originally  the distributions were simply a convenience citation needed but later they became the usual choice even for unix or linux experts     to date  linux has proven more popular in the server market  primarily for web and database servers  for example  in the lamp stack   and in embedded devices market than in the desktop market     many linux distributions provide an installation system akin to that provided with other modern operating systems  on the other hand  some distributions  including gentoo linux  provide only the binaries of a basic kernel  compilation tools  and an installer  the installer compiles all the requested software for the specific architecture of the user s computer  using these tools and the provided source code     distributions are normally segmented into packages  each package contains a specific application or service  examples of packages are a library for handling the png image format  a collection of fonts or a web browser     the package is typically provided as compiled code  with installation and removal of packages handled by a package management system  pms  rather than a simple file archiver  each package intended for such a pms contains meta information such as a package description  version  and  dependencies   the package management system can evaluate this meta information to allow package searches  to perform an automatic upgrade to a newer version  to check that all dependencies of a package are fulfilled  and or to fulfill them automatically     although linux distributions typically contain much more software than proprietary operating systems  it is normal for local administrators to also install software not included in the distribution  an example would be a newer version of a software application than that supplied with a distribution  or an alternative to that chosen by the distribution  for example  kde plasma workspaces rather than gnome or vice versa for the user interface layer   if the additional software is distributed in source only form  this approach requires local compilation  however  if additional software is locally added  the  state  of the local system may fall out of synchronization with the state of the package manager s database  if so  the local administrator will be required to take additional measures to ensure the entire system is kept up to date  the package manager may no longer be able to do so automatically     most distributions install packages  including the kernel and other core operating system components  in a predetermined configuration  few now require or even permit configuration adjustments at first install time  this makes installation less daunting  particularly for new users  but is not always acceptable  for specific requirements  much software must be carefully configured to be useful  to work correctly with other software  or to be secure  and local administrators are often obliged to spend time reviewing and reconfiguring assorted software     some distributions go to considerable lengths to specifically adjust and customize most or all of the software included in the distribution  not all do so  some distributions provide configuration tools to assist in this process     by replacing everything provided in a distribution  an administrator may reach a  distribution less  state  everything was retrieved  compiled  configured  and installed locally  it is possible to build such a system from scratch  avoiding a distribution altogether  one needs a way to generate the first binaries until the system is self hosting  this can be done via compilation on another system capable of building binaries for the intended target  possibly by cross compilation   for example  see linux from scratch     broadly  linux distributions may be     the diversity of linux distributions is due to technical  organizational  and philosophical variation among vendors and users  the permissive licensing of free software means that any user with sufficient knowledge and interest can customize an existing distribution or design one to suit his or her own needs     a  live  distribution is a linux distribution that can be booted from removable storage media such as optical discs or usb flash drives  instead of being installed on and booted from a hard disk drive  the portability of installation free distributions makes them advantageous for applications such as demonstrations  borrowing someone else s computer  rescue operations  or as installation media for a standard distribution     when the operating system is booted from a read only medium such as a cd or dvd  any user data that needs to be retained between sessions cannot be stored on the boot device but must be written to another storage device  such as a usb flash drive or a hard disk drive       many linux distributions provide a  live  form in addition to their conventional form  which is a network based or removable media image intended to be used only for installation  such distributions include suse  ubuntu  linux mint  mepis and fedora  some distributions  including knoppix  puppy linux  devil linux  supergamer  slitaz gnu linux and dyne bolic  are designed primarily for live use  additionally  some minimal distributions can be run directly from as little space as one floppy disk without the need to change the contents of the system s hard disk drive       well known linux distributions include     distrowatch attempts to include every known distribution of linuxcitation needed  whether currently active or not  it also maintains a ranking of distributions based on its own site s page views  as a measure of relative popularity     other distributions target specific niches  such as     whether google s android counts as a linux distribution is a matter of definition  it uses the linux kernel  so the linux foundation   and chris dibona    google s open source chief  agree that android is a linux distribution  others  such as google engineer patrick brady  disagree by noting the lack of support for many gnu tools in android  including the glibc       the free standards group is an organization formed by major software and hardware vendors that aims to improve interoperability between different distributions  among their proposed standards are the linux standard base  which defines a common abi and packaging system for linux  and the filesystem hierarchy standard which recommends a standard filenaming chart  notably the basic directory names found on the root of the tree of any linux filesystem  those standards  however  see limited use  even among the distributions developed by members of the organization citation needed    the diversity of linux distributions means that not all software runs on all distributions  depending on what libraries and other system attributes are required  packaged software and software repositories are usually specific to a particular distribution  though cross installation is sometimes possible on closely related distributions citation needed    there are tools available to help people select an appropriate distribution  such as several versions of the linux distribution chooser    and the universal package search tool whohas    there are easy ways to try out several linux distributions before deciding on one  multi distro is a live cd that contains nine space saving distributions       virtual machines such as virtualbox and vmware workstation virtualize hardware allowing users to test live media on a virtual machine     details and interest rankings of linux distributions are available on distrowatch and a fairly comprehensive list of live cds is available at livecdlist com  osdir com offers screenshots as a way to get a first impression of various distributions     there are many ways to install a linux distribution  the most common method of installing linux is by booting from an optical disk that contains the installation program and installable software  such a disk can be burned from a downloaded iso image  purchased alone for a low price  provided as a cover disk with a magazine  shipped for free by request  or obtained as part of a box set that may also include manuals and additional commercial software     early linux distributions were installed using sets of floppies but this has been abandoned by all major distributions  nowadays most distributions offer cd and dvd sets with the vital packages on the first disc and less important packages on later ones  they usually also allow installation over a network after booting from either a set of floppies or a cd with only a small amount of data on it       new users tend to begin by partitioning a hard drive in order to keep their previously installed operating system  the linux distribution can then be installed on its own separate partition without affecting previously saved data     in a live cd setup  the computer boots the entire operating system from cd without first installing it on the computer s hard disk  some distributions have a live cd installer  where the computer boots the operating system from the disk  and then proceeds to install it onto the computer s hard disk  providing a seamless transition from the os running from the cd to the os running from the hard disk     both servers and personal computers that come with linux already installed are available from vendors including hewlett packard  dell and system       on embedded devices  linux is typically held in the device s firmware and may or may not be consumer accessible     anaconda  one of the more popular installers  is used by red hat enterprise linux  fedora and other distributions to simplify the installation process  debian  ubuntu and many others use debian installer     some distributions let the user install linux on top of their current system  such as winlinux or colinux  linux is installed to the windows hard disk partition  and can be started from inside windows itself    virtual machines  such as virtualbox or vmware  also make it possible for linux to be run inside another os  the vm software simulates a separate computer onto which the linux system is installed  after installation  the virtual machine can be booted as if it were an independent computer     various tools are also available to perform full dual boot installations from existing platforms without a cd  most notably     some specific proprietary software products are not available in any form for linux  this includes many popular computer games  although in recent years some game manufacturers have begun making their software available for linux  emulation and api translation projects like wine and crossover make it possible to run non linux based software on linux systems  either by emulating a proprietary operating system or by translating proprietary api calls  e g   calls to microsoft s win   or directx apis  into native linux api calls  a virtual machine can also be used to run a proprietary os  like microsoft windows  on top of linux     computer hardware is usually sold with an operating system other than linux already installed by the original equipment manufacturer  oem   in the case of ibm pc compatibles the os is usually microsoft windows  in the case of apple macintosh computers it has always been a version of apple s os  currently os x  sun microsystems sold sparc hardware with the solaris installed  video game consoles such as the xbox  playstation  and wii each have their own proprietary os  this limits linux s market share  consumers are unaware that an alternative exists  they must make a conscious effort to use a different operating system  and they must either perform the actual installation themselves  or depend on support from a friend  relative  or computer professional     however  it is possible to buy hardware with linux already installed  lenovo  hewlett packard  dell  affordy    and system   all sell general purpose linux laptops    and custom order pc manufacturers will also build linux systems  but possibly with the windows key on the keyboard   fixstars solutions  formerly terra soft  sells macintosh computers and playstation   consoles with yellow dog linux installed     it is more common to find embedded devices sold with linux as the default manufacturer supported os  including the linksys nslu  nas device  tivo s line of personal video recorders  and linux based cellphones  including android smartphones   pdas  and portable music players     the end user license agreement  eula  for apple gives the consumer the opportunity to reject the license and obtain a refund  the current microsoft windows license lets the manufacturer determine the refund policy    with previous versions of windows  it was possible to obtain a refund if the manufacturer failed to provide the refund by litigation in the small claims courts    on    february       a group of linux users in orange county  california held a  windows refund day  protest in an attempt to pressure microsoft into issuing them refunds    in france  the linuxfrench and aful  french speaking libre software users  association  organizations along with free software activist roberto di cosmo started a  windows detax  movement    which led to a      petition against  racketiciels   translation  racketware  with        signatories and the dgccrf branch of the french government filing several complaints against bundled software  on march           a new international petition was launched by aful on the avaaz platform    translated into several languages and supported by many organizations around the world
