 a nettop  or miniature pc  mini pc or smart micro pc  is a very small form factor  inexpensive  low power legacy free desktop computer designed for basic tasks such as internet surfing  accessing web based applications  document processing  and audio video playback      the word nettop is a portmanteau of internet and desktop     compared to ordinary desktop computers  nettops are not only smaller and cheaper   but they also consume much less power  for example  compulab s fit pc  consumes no more than   watts of power  whereas a typical desktop would easily consume more than     watts of power  consequently  nettops require significantly less cooling and may even be completely fanless  some do not have an optical disk drive and use a solid state disk  making them completely silent  the tradeoff is that the hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced  and hence make nettops less appropriate for running complex or resource intensive applications             some nettops are designed to have stylish cases or run windows operating systems in order to target the mainstream  others are designed more towards business and experienced computer users  these models typically run a version of linux to allow better customization and cut costs  the following list identifies some computers that are designed and marketed as nettops         there are three platforms that are primarily intended for nettops and netbooks     some nettops have also adopted system on a chip designs  although many major parts such as chipsets  video cards and storage devices can also be found on desktops  the cpus that are put inside nettops are the fundamental component that differentiate them from normal desktops  the list below contains a range of hardware components that a typical nettop may be assembled from     intel core i     intel core i     intel s atom processor has been adopted by several hardware manufacturers  such as asus  msi  and sony  for nettops  nvidia has also released its first generation ion platform  which puts geforce     m motherboard gpu alongside the atom processor to provide better high definition video playback ability and lower power consumption    in addition  nvidia has announced that it will support via s cpus this year    to further reduce the manufacturing cost and improve power efficiency  many manufacturers and start up companies have chosen to use cpus that were originally targeted at embedded computing devices such as amd s geode and arm cortex based cpus     many net top models are x   processor based and as such are capable of running standard pc oss  there are also operating systems designed specifically for nettops and other machines in the same performance class  linux distribution supporting nettops is ubuntu  previously supported ubuntu netbook edition  moblin  and joli os  some high end nettops and upcoming models are capable of running windows vista and windows      linux has also been adopted by nettop manufacturers as it costs little to no money to install and supports a wide range of cpu architectures  google s android linux distribution is another option  although google s android was originally designed for smartphones  it has also taken a seat in the nettop market       nettops fall into intel s category of  basic pc   which usually cost from      to         intel describes nettops as a large potential market  nettops can serve as an affordable first computer for people in developing countries  or as an environmentally friendly choice as a secondary computer for people in developed countries
