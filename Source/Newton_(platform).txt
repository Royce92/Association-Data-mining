 the newton platform is a discontinued personal digital assistant that apple inc  developed  development of the newton platform started in      and officially ended on february           some electronic engineering and the manufacture of apple s newton devices was done by motorola  most newton devices were based on the arm     risc processor and all featured handwriting recognition software  most newton devices were developed and marketed by apple  this includes the whole messagepad line and the emate       but other companies   motorola  sharp  and digital ocean   also released devices that ran the newton os             the newton project was a pda platform  the pda category did not exist for most of newton s genesis  and the phrase  personal digital assistant  was coined relatively late in the development cycle by apple s ceo john sculley   the driving force behind the project  larry tesler determined that a powerful  low power processor was needed for sophisticated graphics manipulation  he found hermann hauser  with the acorn risc machine  arm  processor  and put together advanced risc machines  now arm holdings    newton was intended to be a complete reinvention of personal computing  for most of its design lifecycle newton had a large format screen  more internal memory  and an object oriented graphics kernel  one of the original motivating use cases for the design was known as the  architect scenario   in which newton s designers imagined a residential architect working quickly with a client to sketch  clean up  and interactively modify a simple two dimensional home plan citation needed    there is  however  an extensive history of pen computing that predates the newton  though not generally in the form of what would now be called a pda     for a portion of the newton s development cycle  roughly the middle third   the project s intended programming language was dylan  a language apple created for this platform  though in fact the language and environment never matured enough for any applications to be successfully written citation needed dylan never lived up to its developers  performance expectations  when the move was made to a smaller design  designed by jonathan ive     dylan was relegated to experimental status in the  bauhaus project  and eventually canceled outright  its replacement  newtonscript  had garbage collection and tight integration with the  soup  storage and user interface toolkit  and was specifically designed to run in small ram large rom environments  it was mostly developed by walter smith from      to          the project missed its original goals to reinvent personal computing citation needed and then to rewrite contemporary application programming citation needed the newton project fell victim to project slippage  scope creep  and a growing fear that it would interfere with macintosh sales  it was reinvented as a pda platform which would be a complementary macintosh peripheral instead of a stand alone computer which might compete with the macintosh     although pdas had been developing since the original psion organiser in         the newton has left one particular lasting impression  the term personal digital assistant was first coined to refer to the newton      according to former apple ceo john sculley  the corporation invested approximately us    m to develop newton      mp       mp       emate        mp        most newton devices were pre loaded with a variety of software to help in personal data organization and management  this included such applications as notes  names  and dates  as well as a variety of productivity tools such as a calculator  conversion calculators  metric conversions  currency conversions  etc    time zone maps  etc  in later   x versions of the newton os these applications were refined  and new ones were added  such as the works word processor and the newton internet enabler  as well as the inclusion of bundled  rd party applications  such as the quickfigure works spreadsheet  a  lite  version of pelicanware s quickfigure pro   pocket quicken  the nethopper web browser  and the enroute email client  various newton applications had full import export capabilities with popular desktop office suite and pim  personal information manager  application file formats  primarily by making use of apple s bundled newton connection utilities  or the older newton connection kit  which had been sold separately for newton devices that used the   x versions of the os      the notes application allowed users to create small documents that could contain text that had been typed  or that had been recognized from handwriting  as well as free hand sketches   shapes   and  ink text      in version     of the newton os  the notes application  as well as names  could accept what apple termed  stationery    rd party created plug in modules that could extend the functionality of the basic applications     one of the new types of notes stationery added to newton os     was a hierarchical  bullet ed  collapsible  multi line  checklist   an implementation of outliner software  this could be used for organizing thoughts  priorities   to do  lists  planning steps and sub tasks  etc  each bullet point could contain as many lines of text as desired  a bullet point could be dragged and placed underneath another bullet point  thus forming a hierarchical outline tree  when a bullet point was dragged  the entire sub tree of child bullet points underneath it  if any  would be dragged along as well  if a bullet point had child bullet points  tapping the hollow parent bullet point once would  roll up  or collapse all the children   windowshade  effect   the parent bullet point would become a solid black circle and all the children would disappear  tapping the parent bullet point again would make the children re appear  because this functionality arrived in newton os      several third parties made similar software before for os   x newton machines  the most notable of which was dyno notepad  released in          the names application was used for storing contacts  contacts created either on the newton device or on a windows or macintosh desktop pim could be synchronized to each other    entering a date in names for fields such as birthday or anniversary automatically created corresponding repeating events in the dates application  each contact had an attached free form notes field available to it  that could contain any mix of interleaved text  ink text  shapes  or sketches  like notes  names could be extended by developers  to create special new categories of contacts with specialized pre defined fields  names shipped with   types of contacts   people    companies   and  groups   but a developer could define new types  for instance  client    patient   etc  stand alone software  inc  also created a newton software package called the stationery construction kit  which allowed users to make stationery themselves without aid of any other tools     dates supplied calendar  events  meeting  and alarms functions  including an integrated  to do  list manager  it offered many different display and navigation styles  including a list view  graphical day  time blocking  view  or a week  month  or year grid  as with names and notes  dates items created either on the newton or on a windows or macintosh desktop pim could be synchronized to each other     the newton os consists of three layers  at the lowest level  a microkernel handles resources like tasks and memory  on top of the microkernel  the bulk of the operating system is implemented in c    including the communications layer  handwriting recognition  and the newtonscript environment  the top layer consists of built in and user installed applications written in newtonscript     newtonscript is an advanced object oriented programming language  developed by apple employee walter smith    some programmers complained at the       cost of the toolbox programming environment  additionally  it required learning a new way of programming     the newton toolkit  ntk   an integrated environment tailored to the graphical nature of the newton platform  was developed specifically for developing applications for the newton platform and included a graphical view editor  a template browser  and an interactive inspector window for debugging  initially  it was only available for macintosh computers  and later a microsoft windows version was developed  the technical lead for the newton toolkit was norberto menendez  other engineers on the team were ben sharpe and peter potrebic     data in newton is stored in object oriented databases known as soups  one of the innovative aspects of newton is that soups are available to all programs  and programs can operate cross soup  meaning that the calendar can refer to names in the address book  a note in the notepad can be converted to an appointment  and so forth  and the soups can be programmer extended a new address book enhancement can be built on the data from the existing address book  the soup system also made it easy to synchronize data  and the newton connection tools could be used for importing and exporting data  among many file formats are the rich text format  microsoft word  microsoft excel  microsoft works  and many more     another consequence of the data object soup is that objects can extend built in applications such as the address book so seamlessly that newton users can sometimes not distinguish which program or add on object is responsible for the various features on their own system  because the advanced nature of newton devices makes it easy to accept such add ons  a user rebuilding their system after extended usage might find themselves unable to manually restore their system to the same functionality because some long forgotten downloaded extension was missing  data owned and used by applications and extensions themselves is tossed in the  storage  area of the  extras  drawer in   x newton devices  on   x systems  they can only be found or removed in the memory section of the built in prefs application  in the card slip  also built in   or with third party tools such as newtcase  there is no built in distinction between types of data in that area  for example  an installed application s icon could be sitting right next to a database of addresses used by another installed extension further down the list     finally  the data soup concept works well for data like addresses  which benefit from being shared cross functionally  but it works poorly for discrete data sets like files and documents  later  the     release of the newton os introduced virtual binary objects to alleviate the problem of handling large data objects     several software utilities which accommodate data transfer to and from a host system exist for the following platforms     before the newton project was canceled  it was  spun off  into an apple wholly owned subsidiary company  newton inc   but was reabsorbed several months later when apple ceo gil amelio was fired by the board and steve jobs took over as then interim ceo  two ex apple newton developers founded pixo  the company that created the operating system for the original ipod     speculation continued for several years that apple might release a new pda with some newton technology or collaborate with palm  feeding a bit of speculation  apple put the  print recognizer  part of the newton     handwriting recognition system into mac os x v      known as  jaguar    it can be used with graphics tablets to seamlessly input handwritten printed text anywhere there was an insertion point on the screen  this technology  known as  inkwell   appears in the system preferences whenever a tablet input device is plugged in  an easter egg in print recognizer on the newton  write  rosetta  rosetta  rosetta    and the newton will insert  rosetta  rosetta  hey  that s me   instead  was present in inkwell in mac os      and       but seems to have been removed in       larry yaeger was the author of the original rosetta recognizer on the newton  and was also responsible for porting it to mac os x    the rosetta name was later used for apple s powerpc software translation layer for intel based macs     some of the handwriting recognition technology from the newton later found its way into windows ce  the letter preferences menus showing the different ways that people write cursive characters were pixel identical on windows ce to those previously used on the messagepad     at an all things digital conference in       steve jobs made reference to a new  apple pda   perhaps a successor to the newton  which the company had developed but had decided not to bring to market    the tablet eventually evolved into the ios product familycitation needed     since       the einstein project   has been working on emulating the newton for use as an alternate os on other platforms  it is currently available for the sharp zaurus  apple s mac os x  nokia maemo  microsoft windows  and the pepper pad    the emulator is an open source project  but requires an original newton rom to be installed in order to function  since september       einstein also runs on iphones  ipads  and the android operating system since march            a possible newton revival was at one time a common source of speculation among the macintosh user base  when patents for a tablet based macintosh were applied for    rumor sites jumped at the possibility of a new tablet pc style macintosh  this later turned out to be the ipad  which currently runs apple s proprietary ios system software     in september       michael tchao  one of the newton s marketing product champions  returned to apple    michael tchao is now the vp of ipad product marketing     programs have been written for the newton since its cancellation  including reading ebooks and reading rss feeds citation needed    the messagepad was featured in an august      installment of garry trudeau s popular political cartoon doonesbury  where its handwriting recognition was mocked  the final panel of the strip showed the newton producing the text  egg freckles  in response to input  this phrase was subsequently included as a trigger for an easter egg in later editions of the messagepad  producing a panel from the strip when it was entered on the device  apple subsequently donated a messagepad to trudeau       during the simpsons episode  lisa on ice   first broadcast in       a scene also makes fun of the newton s handwriting recognition  bully kearney has dolph take a memo on an apple newton to beat up class nerd martin prince  when dolph writes  beat up martin  on the screen  the handwriting recognition turns it into  eat up martha   kearney then just throws the newton at the back of martin s head     newtonscript programming  newtonscript is the native programming language for all messagepads
