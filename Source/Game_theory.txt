 game theory is the study of strategic decision making  specifically  it is  the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision makers    an alternative term suggested  as a more descriptive name for the discipline  is interactive decision theory   game theory is mainly used in economics  political science  and psychology  as well as logic  computer science  and biology  the subject first addressed zero sum games  such that one person s gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants  today  however  game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations  and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science  including both humans and non humans  e g  computers  animals      modern game theory began with the idea regarding the existence of mixed strategy equilibria in two person zero sum games and its proof by john von neumann  von neumann s original proof used brouwer fixed point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets  which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics  his paper was followed by the      book theory of games and economic behavior  co written with oskar morgenstern  which considered cooperative games of several players  the second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility  which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision making under uncertainty     this theory was developed extensively in the     s by many scholars  game theory was later explicitly applied to biology in the     s  although similar developments go back at least as far as the     s  game theory has been widely recognized as an important tool in many fields  with the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences going to game theorist jean tirole in       eleven game theorists have now won the economics nobel prize  john maynard smith was awarded the crafoord prize for his application of game theory to biology             the games studied in game theory are well defined mathematical objects  to be fully defined  a game must specify the following elements  the players of the game  the information and actions available to each player at each decision point  and the payoffs for each outcome   rasmusen refers to these four  essential elements  by the acronym  papi     a game theorist typically uses these elements  along with a solution concept of their choosing  to deduce a set of equilibrium strategies for each player such that  when these strategies are employed  no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy  these equilibrium strategies determine an equilibrium to the game a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability     most cooperative games are presented in the characteristic function form  while the extensive and the normal forms are used to define noncooperative games     the extensive form can be used to formalize games with a time sequencing of moves  games here are played on trees  as pictured to the left   here each vertex  or node  represents a point of choice for a player  the player is specified by a number listed by the vertex  the lines out of the vertex represent a possible action for that player  the payoffs are specified at the bottom of the tree  the extensive form can be viewed as a multi player generalization of a decision tree      the game pictured consists of two players  the way this particular game is structured  i e   with sequential decision making and perfect information   player    moves  first by choosing either f or u  letters are assigned arbitrarily for mathematical purposes   next in the sequence  player    who has now seen player   s move  chooses to play either a or r  once player   has made his  her choice  the game is considered finished and each player gets their respective payoff  suppose that player   chooses u and then player   chooses a  player   then gets a payoff of  eight   which in real world terms can be interpreted in many ways  the simplest of which is in terms of money but could be extrapolated to include things such as eight days of vacation or eight countries conquered or even eight more opportunities to play the same game against other players  and player   gets a payoff of  two      the extensive form can also capture simultaneous move games and games with imperfect information  to represent it  either a dotted line connects different vertices to represent them as being part of the same information set  i e  the players do not know at which point they are   or a closed line is drawn around them   see example in the imperfect information section      the normal  or strategic form  game is usually represented by a matrix which shows the players  strategies  and payoffs  see the example to the right   more generally it can be represented by any function that associates a payoff for each player with every possible combination of actions  in the accompanying example there are two players  one chooses the row and the other chooses the column  each player has two strategies  which are specified by the number of rows and the number of columns  the payoffs are provided in the interior  the first number is the payoff received by the row player  player   in our example   the second is the payoff for the column player  player   in our example   suppose that player   plays up and that player   plays left  then player   gets a payoff of    and player   gets       when a game is presented in normal form  it is presumed that each player acts simultaneously or  at least  without knowing the actions of the other  if players have some information about the choices of other players  the game is usually presented in extensive form     every extensive form game has an equivalent normal form game  however the transformation to normal form may result in an exponential blowup in the size of the representation  making it computationally impractical      in games that possess removable utility separate rewards are not given  rather  the characteristic function decides the payoff of each unity  the idea is that the unity that is  empty   so to speak  does not receive a reward at all     the origin of this form is to be found in john von neumann and oskar morgenstern s book  when looking at these instances  they guessed that when a union  appears  it works against the fraction  as if two individuals were playing a normal game  the balanced payoff of c is a basic function  although there are differing examples that help determine coalitional amounts from normal games  not all appear that in their function form can be derived from such     formally  a characteristic function is seen as   n v   where n represents the group of people and  is a normal utility     such characteristic functions have expanded to describe games where there is no removable utility     as a method of applied mathematics  game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors  it was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors  including behaviors of firms  markets  and consumers  the first use of game theoretic analysis was by antoine augustin cournot in      with his solution of the cournot duopoly  the use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded  and game theory has been applied to political  sociological  and psychological behaviors as well     although pre twentieth century naturalists such as charles darwin made game theoretic kinds of statements example needed the use of game theoretic analysis in biology began with ronald fisher s studies of animal behavior during the     s  this work predates the name  game theory   but it shares many important features with this field  the developments in economics were later applied to biology largely by john maynard smith in his book evolution and the theory of games     in addition to being used to describe  predict  and explain behavior  game theory has also been used to develop theories of ethical or normative behavior and to prescribe such behavior   in economics and philosophy  scholars have applied game theory to help in the understanding of good or proper behavior  game theoretic arguments of this type can be found as far back as plato      the first known use is to describe and model how human populations behave  somewho  scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being studied  this particular view of game theory has come under recent criticism  first  it is criticized because the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated  game theorists may assume players always act in a way to directly maximize their wins  the homo economicus model   but in practice  human behavior often deviates from this model  explanations of this phenomenon are many  irrationality  new models of deliberation  or even different motives  like that of altruism   game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used in physics  thus while their assumptions do not always hold  they can treat game theory as a reasonable scientific ideal akin to the models used by physicists  however  in the centipede game  guess     of the average game  and the dictator game  people regularly do not play nash equilibria  these experiments have demonstrated that individuals do not play equilibrium strategies  there is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of these experiments      alternatively  somewho  authors claim that nash equilibria do not provide predictions for human populations  but rather provide an explanation for why populations that play nash equilibria remain in that state  however  the question of how populations reach those points remains open     some game theorists  following the work of john maynard smith and george r  price  have turned to evolutionary game theory in order to resolve these issues  these models presume either no rationality or bounded rationality on the part of players  despite the name  evolutionary game theory does not necessarily presume natural selection in the biological sense  evolutionary game theory includes both biological as well as cultural evolution and also models of individual learning  for example  fictitious play dynamics      on the other hand  somewho  scholars see game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of human beings  but as a suggestion for how people ought to behave  since a strategy  corresponding to a nash equilibrium of a game constitutes one s best response to the actions of the other players   provided they are in  the same  nash equilibrium   playing a strategy that is part of a nash equilibrium seems appropriate  however  the rationality of such a decision has been proved only for special cases  this normative use of game theory has also come under criticism  first  in some cases it is appropriate to play a non equilibrium strategy if one expects others to play non equilibrium strategies as well  for an example  see guess     of the average     second  the prisoner s dilemma presents another potential counterexample  in the prisoner s dilemma  each player pursuing their own self interest leads both players to be worse off than had they not pursued their own self interests     game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents   applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches  such as auctions  bargaining  mergers   acquisitions pricing    fair division  duopolies  oligopolies  social network formation  agent based computational economics    general equilibrium  mechanism design    and voting systems    and across such broad areas as experimental economics    behavioral economics    information economics   industrial organization    and political economy         this research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as  solution concepts  or  equilibria  based on what is required by norms of  ideal  rationality  in non cooperative games  the most famous of these is the nash equilibrium  a set of strategies is a nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies  so  if all the players are playing the strategies in a nash equilibrium  they have no unilateral incentive to deviate  since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing         the payoffs of the game are generally taken to represent the utility of individual players  often in modeling situations the payoffs represent money  which presumably corresponds to an individual s utility  this assumption  however  can be faulty       a prototypical paper on game theory in economics begins by presenting a game that is an abstraction of a particular economic situation  one or more solution concepts are chosen  and the author demonstrates which strategy sets in the presented game are equilibria of the appropriate type  naturally one might wonder to what use this information should be put  economists and business professors suggest two primary uses  noted above   descriptive and prescriptive      the application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division  political economy  public choice  war bargaining  positive political theory  and social choice theory  in each of these areas  researchers have developed game theoretic models in which the players are often voters  states  special interest groups  and politicians     early examples of game theory applied to political science are provided by anthony downs  in his book an economic theory of democracy    he applies the hotelling firm location model to the political process  in the downsian model  political candidates commit to ideologies on a one dimensional policy space  downs first shows how the political candidates will converge to the ideology preferred by the median voter if voters are fully informed  but then argues that voters choose to remain rationally ignorant which allows for candidate divergence     it has also been proposed that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government  taking the simplest case of a monarchy  for example  the king  being only one person  does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects  sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king  or other established government  as the person whose orders will be followed  coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred  since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime  thus  in a process that can be modeled by variants of the prisoner s dilemma  during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign  even if all the citizens know they would be better off if they were all to act collectively       a game theoretic explanation for democratic peace is that public and open debate in democracies send clear and reliable information regarding their intentions to other states  in contrast  it is difficult to know the intentions of nondemocratic leaders  what effect concessions will have  and if promises will be kept  thus there will be mistrust and unwillingness to make concessions if at least one of the parties in a dispute is a non democracy       game theory could also help predict nation s responses when there is a new rule or law to be applied to that nation  one example would be peter john wood s        research when he looked into what nations could do to help reduce climate change  wood thought this could be accomplished by making treaties with other nations to reduce green house gas emissions  however  he concluded that this idea could not work because it would create a prisoner s dilemma to the nations       unlike those in economics  the payoffs for games in biology are often interpreted as corresponding to fitness  in addition  the focus has been less on equilibria that correspond to a notion of rationality and more on ones that would be maintained by evolutionary forces  the best known equilibrium in biology is known as the evolutionarily stable strategy  ess   first introduced in  smith   price        although its initial motivation did not involve any of the mental requirements of the nash equilibrium  every ess is a nash equilibrium     in biology  game theory has been used as a model to understand many different phenomena  it was first used to explain the evolution  and stability  of the approximate     sex ratios   fisher       suggested that the     sex ratios are a result of evolutionary forces acting on individuals who could be seen as trying to maximize their number of grandchildren     additionally  biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ess to explain the emergence of animal communication    the analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals  for example  the mobbing behavior of many species  in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator  seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization  ants have also been shown to exhibit feed forward behavior akin to fashion  see paul ormerod s butterfly economics      biologists have used the game of chicken to analyze fighting behavior and territoriality       according to maynard smith  in the preface to evolution and the theory of games   paradoxically  it has turned out that game theory is more readily applied to biology than to the field of economic behaviour for which it was originally designed   evolutionary game theory has been used to explain many seemingly incongruous phenomena in nature       one such phenomenon is known as biological altruism  this is a situation in which an organism appears to act in a way that benefits other organisms and is detrimental to itself  this is distinct from traditional notions of altruism because such actions are not conscious  but appear to be evolutionary adaptations to increase overall fitness  examples can be found in species ranging from vampire bats that regurgitate blood they have obtained from a night s hunting and give it to group members who have failed to feed  to worker bees that care for the queen bee for their entire lives and never mate  to vervet monkeys that warn group members of a predator s approach  even when it endangers that individual s chance of survival    all of these actions increase the overall fitness of a group  but occur at a cost to the individual     evolutionary game theory explains this altruism with the idea of kin selection  altruists discriminate between the individuals they help and favor relatives  hamilton s rule explains the evolutionary rationale behind this selection with the equation c b r where the cost  c  to the altruist must be less than the benefit  b  to the recipient multiplied by the coefficient of relatedness  r   the more closely related two organisms are causes the incidences of altruism to increase because they share many of the same alleles  this means that the altruistic individual  by ensuring that the alleles of its close relative are passed on   through survival of its offspring  can forgo the option of having offspring itself because the same number of alleles are passed on  helping a sibling for example  in diploid animals   has a coefficient of    because  on average  an individual shares   of the alleles in its sibling s offspring  ensuring that enough of a sibling s offspring survive to adulthood precludes the necessity of the altruistic individual producing offspring    the coefficient values depend heavily on the scope of the playing field  for example if the choice of whom to favor includes all genetic living things  not just all relatives  we assume the discrepancy between all humans only accounts for approximately    of the diversity in the playing field  a co efficient that was   in the smaller field becomes        similarly if it is considered that information other than that of a genetic nature  e g  epigenetics  religion  science  etc   persisted through time the playing field becomes larger still  and the discrepancies smaller     game theory has come to play an increasingly important role in logic and in computer science  several logical theories have a basis in game semantics  in addition  computer scientists have used games to model interactive computations  also  game theory provides a theoretical basis to the field of multi agent systems     separately  game theory has played a role in online algorithms  in particular  the k server problem  which has in the past been referred to as games with moving costs and request answer games    yao s principle is a game theoretic technique for proving lower bounds on the computational complexity of randomized algorithms  especially online algorithms     the emergence of the internet has motivated the development of algorithms for finding equilibria in games  markets  computational auctions  peer to peer systems  and security and information markets  algorithmic game theory   and within it algorithmic mechanism design   combine computational algorithm design and analysis of complex systems with economic theory       game theory has been put to several uses in philosophy  responding to two papers by w v o  quinexa               lewis        used game theory to develop a philosophical account of convention  in so doing  he provided the first analysis of common knowledge and employed it in analyzing play in coordination games  in addition  he first suggested that one can understand meaning in terms of signaling games  this later suggestion has been pursued by several philosophers since lewis    following lewis        game theoretic account of conventions  edna ullmann margalit        and bicchieri        have developed theories of social norms that define them as nash equilibria that result from transforming a mixed motive game into a coordination game         game theory has also challenged philosophers to think in terms of interactive epistemology  what it means for a collective to have common beliefs or knowledge  and what are the consequences of this knowledge for the social outcomes resulting from agents  interactions  philosophers who have worked in this area include bicchieri                   skyrms           and stalnaker              in ethics  somewho  authors have attempted to pursue thomas hobbes  project of deriving morality from self interest  since games like the prisoner s dilemma present an apparent conflict between morality and self interest  explaining why cooperation is required by self interest is an important component of this project  this general strategy is a component of the general social contract view in political philosophy  for examples  see gauthier        and kavka               other authors have attempted to use evolutionary game theory in order to explain the emergence of human attitudes about morality and corresponding animal behaviors  these authors look at several games including the prisoner s dilemma  stag hunt  and the nash bargaining game as providing an explanation for the emergence of attitudes about morality  see  e g   skyrmsxa              and sober and wilsonxa             some assumptions used in some parts of game theory have been challenged in philosophy  for example  psychological egoism states that rationality reduces to self interest a claim debated among philosophers   see psychological egoism criticisms     a game is cooperative if the players are able to form binding commitments  for instance  the legal system requires them to adhere to their promises  in noncooperative games  this is not possible     often it is assumed that communication among players is allowed in cooperative games  but not in non cooperative ones  however  this classification on two binary criteria has been questioned  and sometimes rejected       of the two types of games  noncooperative games are able to model situations to the finest details  producing accurate results  cooperative games focus on the game at large  considerable efforts have been made to link the two approaches  the so called nash programme  nash program is the research agenda for investigating on the one hand axiomatic bargaining solutions and on the other hand the equilibrium outcomes of strategic bargaining procedures    has already established many of the cooperative solutions as noncooperative equilibria     hybrid games contain cooperative and non cooperative elements  for instance  coalitions of players are formed in a cooperative game  but these play in a non cooperative fashion     a symmetric game is a game where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed  not on who is playing them  if the identities of the players can be changed without changing the payoff to the strategies  then a game is symmetric  many of the commonly studied     games are symmetric  the standard representations of chicken  the prisoner s dilemma  and the stag hunt are all symmetric games  somewho  scholars would consider certain asymmetric games as examples of these games as well  however  the most common payoffs for each of these games are symmetric     most commonly studied asymmetric games are games where there are not identical strategy sets for both players  for instance  the ultimatum game and similarly the dictator game have different strategies for each player  it is possible  however  for a game to have identical strategies for both players  yet be asymmetric  for example  the game pictured to the right is asymmetric despite having identical strategy sets for both players     zero sum games are a special case of constant sum games  in which choices by players can neither increase nor decrease the available resources  in zero sum games the total benefit to all players in the game  for every combination of strategies  always adds to zero  more informally  a player benefits only at the equal expense of others   poker exemplifies a zero sum game  ignoring the possibility of the house s cut   because one wins exactly the amount one s opponents lose  other zero sum games include matching pennies and most classical board games including go and chess     many games studied by game theorists  including the infamous prisoner s dilemma  are non zero sum games  because the outcome has net results greater or less than zero  informally  in non zero sum games  a gain by one player does not necessarily correspond with a loss by another     constant sum games correspond to activities like theft and gambling  but not to the fundamental economic situation in which there are potential gains from trade  it is possible to transform any game into a  possibly asymmetric  zero sum game by adding a dummy player  often called  the board   whose losses compensate the players  net winnings     simultaneous games are games where both players move simultaneously  or if they do not move simultaneously  the later players are unaware of the earlier players  actions  making them effectively simultaneous   sequential games  or dynamic games  are games where later players have some knowledge about earlier actions  this need not be perfect information about every action of earlier players  it might be very little knowledge  for instance  a player may know that an earlier player did not perform one particular action  while he does not know which of the other available actions the first player actually performed     the difference between simultaneous and sequential games is captured in the different representations discussed above  often  normal form is used to represent simultaneous games  while extensive form is used to represent sequential ones  the transformation of extensive to normal form is one way  meaning that multiple extensive form games correspond to the same normal form  consequently  notions of equilibrium for simultaneous games are insufficient for reasoning about sequential games  see subgame perfection     in short  the differences between sequential and simultaneous games are as follows     an important subset of sequential games consists of games of perfect information  a game is one of perfect information if all players know the moves previously made by all other players  thus  only sequential games can be games of perfect information because players in simultaneous games do not know the actions of the other players  most games studied in game theory are imperfect information games  interesting examples of perfect information games include the ultimatum game and centipede game  recreational games of perfect information games include chess  go and mancala  many card games are games of imperfect information  such as poker or contract bridge     perfect information is often confused with complete information  which is a similar concept  complete information requires that every player know the strategies and payoffs available to the other players but not necessarily the actions taken  games of incomplete information can be reduced  however  to games of imperfect information by introducing  moves by nature        games in which the difficulty of finding an optimal strategy stems from the multiplicity of possible moves are called combinatorial games  examples include chess and go  games that involve imperfect or incomplete information may also have a strong combinatorial character  for instance backgammon  there is no unified theory addressing combinatorial elements in games  there are  however  mathematical tools that can solve particular problems and answer general questions       games of perfect information have been studied in combinatorial game theory  which has developed novel representations  e g  surreal numbers  as well as combinatorial and algebraic  and sometimes non constructive  proof methods to solve games of certain types  including  loopy  games that may result in infinitely long sequences of moves  these methods address games with higher combinatorial complexity than those usually considered in traditional  or  economic   game theory      a typical game that has been solved this way is hex  a related field of study  drawing from computational complexity theory  is game complexity  which is concerned with estimating the computational difficulty of finding optimal strategies       research in artificial intelligence has addressed both perfect and imperfect  or incomplete  information games that have very complex combinatorial structures  like chess  go  or backgammon  for which no provable optimal strategies have been found  the practical solutions involve computational heuristics  like alpha beta pruning or use of artificial neural networks trained by reinforcement learning  which make games more tractable in computing practice         games  as studied by economists and real world game players  are generally finished in finitely many moves  pure mathematicians are not so constrained  and set theorists in particular study games that last for infinitely many moves  with the winner  or other payoff  not known until after all those moves are completed     the focus of attention is usually not so much on the best way to play such a game  but whether one player has a winning strategy   it can be proven  using the axiom of choice  that there are gamesxa   even with perfect information and where the only outcomes are  win  or  lose xa   for which neither player has a winning strategy   the existence of such strategies  for cleverly designed games  has important consequences in descriptive set theory     much of game theory is concerned with finite  discrete games  that have a finite number of players  moves  events  outcomes  etc  many concepts can be extended  however  continuous games allow players to choose a strategy from a continuous strategy set  for instance  cournot competition is typically modeled with players  strategies being any non negative quantities  including fractional quantities     differential games such as the continuous pursuit and evasion game are continuous games where the evolution of the players  state variables is governed by differential equations  the problem of finding an optimal strategy in a differential game is closely related to the optimal control theory  in particular  there are two types of strategies  the open loop strategies are found using the pontryagin maximum principle while the closed loop strategies are found using bellman s dynamic programming method     a particular case of differential games are the games with a random time horizon    in such games  the terminal time is a random variable with a given probability distribution function  therefore  the players maximize the mathematical expectation of the cost function  it was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval     games with an arbitrary  but finite  number of players are often called n person games    evolutionary game theory considers games involving a population of decision makers  where the frequency with which a particular decision is made can change over time in response to the decisions made by all individuals in the population  in biology  this is intended to model  biological  evolution  where genetically programmed organisms pass along some of their strategy programming to their offspring  in economics  the same theory is intended to capture population changes because people play the game many times within their lifetime  and consciously  and perhaps rationally  switch strategies       individual decision problems with stochastic outcomes are sometimes considered  one player games   these situations are not considered game theoretical by some authors by whom  they may be modeled using similar tools within the related disciplines of decision theory  operations research  and areas of artificial intelligence  particularly ai planning  with uncertainty  and multi agent system  although these fields may have different motivators  the mathematics involved are substantially the same  e g  using markov decision processes  mdp  citation needed    stochastic outcomes can also be modeled in terms of game theory by adding a randomly acting player who makes  chance moves    moves by nature      this player is not typically considered a third player in what is otherwise a two player game  but merely serves to provide a roll of the dice where required by the game     for some problems  different approaches to modeling stochastic outcomes may lead to different solutions  for example  the difference in approach between mdps and the minimax solution is that the latter considers the worst case over a set of adversarial moves  rather than reasoning in expectation about these moves given a fixed probability distribution  the minimax approach may be advantageous where stochastic models of uncertainty are not available  but may also be overestimating extremely unlikely  but costly  events  dramatically swaying the strategy in such scenarios if it is assumed that an adversary can force such an event to happen     see black swan theory for more discussion on this kind of modeling issue  particularly as it relates to predicting and limiting losses in investment banking      general models that include all elements of stochastic outcomes  adversaries  and partial or noisy observability  of moves by other players  have also been studied  the  gold standard  is considered to be partially observable stochastic game  posg   but few realistic problems are computationally feasible in posg representation       these are games the play of which is the development of the rules for another game  the target or subject game  metagames seek to maximize the utility value of the rule set developed  the theory of metagames is related to mechanism design theory     the term metagame analysis is also used to refer to a practical approach developed by nigel howard    whereby a situation is framed as a strategic game in which stakeholders try to realise their objectives by means of the options available to them  subsequent developments have led to the formulation of confrontation analysis     these are games prevailing over all forms of society  pooling games are repeated plays with changing payoff table in general over an experienced path and their equilibrium strategies usually take a form of evolutionary social convention and economic convention  pooling game theory emerges to formally recognize the interaction between optimal choice in one play and the emergence of forthcoming payoff table update path  identify the invariance existence and robustness  and predict variance over time  the theory is based upon topological transformation classification of payoff table update over time to predict variance and invariance  and is also within the jurisdiction of the computational law of reachable optimality for ordered system       early discussions of examples of two person games occurred long before the rise of modern  mathematical game theory  the first known discussion of game theory occurred in a letter written by james waldegrave in         in this letter  waldegrave provides a minimax mixed strategy solution to a two person version of the card game le her  james madison made what we now recognize as a game theoretic analysis of the ways states can be expected to behave under different systems of taxation      in his      recherches sur les principes math matiques de la th orie des richesses  researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth   antoine augustin cournot considered a duopoly and presents a solution that is a restricted version of the nash equilibrium     the danish mathematician zeuthen proved that the mathematical model had a winning strategy by using brouwer s fixed point theorem  in his      book applications aux jeux de hasard and earlier notes   mile borel proved a minimax theorem for two person zero sum matrix games only when the pay off matrix was symmetric  borel conjectured that non existence of mixed strategy equilibria in two person zero sum games would occur  a conjecture that was proved false     game theory did not really exist as a unique field until john von neumann published a paper in         von neumann s original proof used brouwer s fixed point theorem on continuous mappings into compact convex sets  which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics  his paper was followed by his      book theory of games and economic behavior  the second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory of utility  which reincarnated daniel bernoulli s old theory of utility  of the money  as an independent discipline  von neumann s work in game theory culminated in this      book  this foundational work contains the method for finding mutually consistent solutions for two person zero sum games  during the following time period  work on game theory was primarily focused on cooperative game theory  which analyzes optimal strategies for groups of individuals  presuming that they can enforce agreements between them about proper strategies       in       the first mathematical discussion of the prisoner s dilemma appeared  and an experiment was undertaken by notable mathematicians merrill m  flood and melvin dresher  as part of the rand corporation s investigations into game theory  rand pursued the studies because of possible applications to global nuclear strategy    around this same time  john nash developed a criterion for mutual consistency of players  strategies  known as nash equilibrium  applicable to a wider variety of games than the criterion proposed by von neumann and morgenstern  this equilibrium is sufficiently general to allow for the analysis of non cooperative games in addition to cooperative ones     game theory experienced a flurry of activity in the     s  during which time the concepts of the core  the extensive form game  fictitious play  repeated games  and the shapley value were developed  in addition  the first applications of game theory to philosophy and political science occurred during this time     in       reinhard selten introduced his solution concept of subgame perfect equilibria  which further refined the nash equilibrium  later he would introduce trembling hand perfection as well   in       john harsanyi developed the concepts of complete information and bayesian games  nash  selten and harsanyi became economics nobel laureates in      for their contributions to economic game theory     in the     s  game theory was extensively applied in biology  largely as a result of the work of john maynard smith and his evolutionarily stable strategy  in addition  the concepts of correlated equilibrium  trembling hand perfection  and common knowledge   were introduced and analyzed     in       game theorists thomas schelling and robert aumann followed nash  selten and harsanyi as nobel laureates  schelling worked on dynamic models  early examples of evolutionary game theory  aumann contributed more to the equilibrium school  introducing an equilibrium coarsening  correlated equilibrium  and developing an extensive formal analysis of the assumption of common knowledge and of its consequences     in       leonid hurwicz  together with eric maskin and roger myerson  was awarded the nobel prize in economics  for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory   myerson s contributions include the notion of proper equilibrium  and an important graduate text  game theory  analysis of conflict   hurwicz introduced and formalized the concept of incentive compatibility     in       alvin e  roth and lloyd s  shapley were awarded the nobel prize in economics  for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design      based on the book by sylvia nasar    the life story of game theorist and mathematician john nash was turned into the biopic a beautiful mind starring russell crowe        games theory  and  theory of games  are mentioned in the military science fiction novel starship troopers by robert a  heinlein    in the      film of the same name  the character carl jenkins refers to his assignment to military intelligence as to  games and theory      one of the main gameplay decision making mechanics of the video game zero escape  virtue s last reward is based on game theory  some of the characters even reference the prisoner s dilemma     the film dr  strangelove satirizes game theoretic ideas about deterrence theory  for example  nuclear deterrence depends on the threat to retaliate catastrophically if a nuclear attack is detected  a game theorist might argue that such threats can fail to be credible  in the sense that they can lead to subgame imperfect equilibria  the movie takes this idea one step further  with the russians irrevocably committing to a catastrophic nuclear response without making the threat public
