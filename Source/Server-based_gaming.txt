 server based gaming  or sbg  is a solution employed by video lotteries and casinos to operate video lottery terminals  vlts  and electronic gaming machines  egms   the latter commonly referred to as slot machines  an sbg system includes a central system and gaming terminals which connect to the central system  sbg systems may be operated locally over a lan or span large geographical areas  even entire nations  over a wan  such as the internet     sbg systems differentiate themselves from other types of video lottery and casino systems by centralizing both game logic and random number generation  game terminals in an sbg system must per definition be authorized and connected to the central system in order to function  something that is not true for systems where all critical game components reside locally in the terminal             sbg shares its roots with server supported gaming  ssg   both types of systems are examples of server centric gaming  which means that they share some similarities  server centric gaming combines classic video poker and video lottery with features of a modern client server computer network  compared to traditional standalone slot machines  sbg and ssg systems facilitate automated remote game and configuration management for example     sbg further builds upon the server centric gaming concept with technology and design principles from thin client computing and online gaming  thus making it fundamentally different from ssg which employs thick client game terminals that have more in common with standalone terminals  the development of sbg has been driven by technological advancements and the benefits made possible thereof      for example  a system described in u s  pat  no            is known as a casino game system of this sort  this system comprises a server and a plurality of clients  and the server can execute a plurality of game programs  each client can access the plurality of game programs that the server executes  and a game image created by the accessed game program is displayed on a display unit of the client  thereafter  a player can play a game from the game program being executed by the server by performing the game operation to the client  a typical conventional casino game system comprises a plurality of independent game devices  and each game device independently executes a game program  according to the system described in u s  pat  no             most of the functions that each game device in this typical conventional casino game system is equipped with can be centralized in the server  in this way  each client only needs to be equipped with minimum functions  i e  user interfaces  display unit and operation accepting unit  and a communication function that enables communication with the server  this dramatically reduces the costs for both hardware and software in the entire casino game system    casino game system and casino game terminal that can be used therein   united states patent application               background of the invention  section     sbg represents a paradigm shift from both standalone terminals and ssg because game logic and rng reside on the server in an sbg system  frequently mentioned benefits of sbg include          gli  gaming laboratories international  has created a standard  gli       which includes requirements and definitions for server centric gaming systems  referred to as client server systems  css    gli differentiates between server based gaming systems  sbgs  and server supported gaming systems  ssgs   gli defines sbgs as  the combination of a server and client terminals in which the entire or integral portion of game content resides on the server    ssgs is defined as  the combination of a server and client terminal s  which together allow the transfer of the entire control program and game content to the client terminal s        gli certifies sbg and ssg systems according to the gli     standard  something which is a requirement by many operators and jurisdictions for them to consider and allow such systems  currently sbg systems are allowed in several countries and us states  both through gli certification and local legislation     there are several server centric systems in production all over the world  most of these are ssg systems  though they are often referred to as sbg systems  the video lottery system of the norwegian state owned lottery norsk tipping is an example of an actual sbg system currently in operation
