 in economic theory  perfect competition  sometimes called pure competition  describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product  because the conditions for perfect competition are strict  there are few if any perfectly competitive markets  still  buyers and sellers in some auction type markets  say for commodities or some financial assets  may approximate the concept  as a pareto efficient allocation of economic resources  perfect competition serves as a natural benchmark against which to contrast other market structures             generally  a perfectly competitive market exists when every participant is a  price taker   and no participant influences the price of the product it buys or sells  specific characteristics may include     in the short run  perfectly competitive markets are not productively efficient as output will not occur where marginal cost is equal to average cost  mc   ac   they are allocatively efficient  as output will always occur where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue  mc   mr   in the long run  perfectly competitive markets are both allocatively and productively efficient     in perfect competition  any profit maximizing producer faces a market price equal to its marginal cost  p   mc   this implies that a factor s price equals the factor s marginal revenue product  it allows for derivation of the supply curve on which the neoclassical approach is based  this is also the reason why  a monopoly does not have a supply curve   the abandonment of price taking creates considerable difficulties for the demonstration of a general equilibrium except under other  very specific conditions such as that of monopolistic competition     in neoclassical economics there have been two strands of looking at what perfect competition is  the first emphasis is on the inability of any one agent to affect prices  usually justified by the fact that any one firm or consumer is so small relative to the whole market that their presence or absence leaves the equilibrium price very nearly unaffected  this assumption of negligible impact of each agent on the equilibrium price has been formalized by aumann        by postulating a continuum of infinitesimal agents  the difference between aumann s approach and that found in undergraduate textbooks is that in the first  agents have the power to choose their own prices but do not individually affect the market price  while in the second it is simply assumed that agents treat prices as parameters  both approaches lead to the same result     the second view of perfect competition conceives of it in terms of agents taking advantage of   and hence  eliminating   profitable exchange opportunities  the faster this arbitrage takes place  the more competitive a market  the implication is that the more competitive a market is under this definition  the faster the average market price will adjust so as to equate supply and demand  and also equate price to marginal costs   in this view   perfect  competition means that this adjustment takes place instantaneously  this is usually modeled via the use of the walrasian auctioneer  see article for more information   the widespread recourse to the auctioneer tale appears to have favored an interpretation of perfect competition as meaning price taking always  i e  also at non equilibrium prices  but this is rejected e g  by arrow        or mas colell et al      steve keen notes   following george stigler  that if firms do not react strategically to one another  the slope of the demand curve that a firm faces is the same as the slope of the market demand curve  hence  if firms are to produce at a level that equates marginal cost and marginal revenue  the model of perfect competition must include at least an infinite number of firms  each producing an output quantity of zero  as noted above  an influential model  of perfect competition in neoclassical economics assumes that the number of buyers and sellers are both of the power of the continuum  that is  an infinity even larger than the number of natural numbers  k  vela velupillai  quotes maury osborne as noting the inapplicability of such models to actual economies since money and the commodities sold each have a smallest positive unit     thus nowadays the dominant intuitive idea of the conditions justifying price taking and thus rendering a market perfectly competitive is an amalgam of several different notions  not all present  nor given equal weight  in all treatments  besides product homogeneity and absence of collusion  the notion more generally associated with perfect competition is the negligibility of the size of agents  which makes them believe that they can sell as much of the good as they wish at the equilibrium price but nothing at a higher price  in particular  firms are described as each one of them facing a horizontal demand curve   however  also widely accepted as part of the notion of perfectly competitive market are perfect information about price distribution and very quick adjustments  whose joint operation establish the law of one price   to the point sometimes of identifying perfect competition with an essentially instantaneous reaching of equilibrium between supply and demand  finally  the idea of free entry with free access to technology is also often listed as a characteristic of perfectly competitive markets  probably owing to a difficulty with abandoning completely the older conception of free competition  in recent decades it has been rediscovered that free entry can be a foundation of absence of market power  alternative to negligibility of agents      free entry also makes it easier to justify the absence of collusion  any collusion by existing firms can be undermined by entry of new firms  the necessarily long period nature of the analysis  entry requires time   also allows a reconciliation of the horizontal demand curve facing each firm according to the theory  with the feeling of businessmen that  contrary to economic theory  sales are by no means unlimited at the current market price   arrow      p xa      sraffian economists  see the assumption of free entry and exit as characteristic of the theory of free competition in classical economics  an approach that is not expressed in terms of schedules of supply and demand     in a perfectly competitive market  a firm s demand curve is perfectly elastic     as mentioned above  the perfect competition model  if interpreted as applying also to short period or very short period behaviour  is approximated only by markets of homogeneous products produced and purchased by very many sellers and buyers  usually organized markets for agricultural products or raw materials  in real world markets  assumptions such as perfect information cannot be verified and are only approximated in organized double auction markets where most agents wait and observe the behaviour of prices before deciding to exchange  but in the long period interpretation perfect information is not necessary  the analysis only aims at determining the average around which market prices gravitate  and for gravitation to operate one does not need perfect information      in the absence of externalities and public goods  perfectly competitive equilibria are pareto efficient  i e  no improvement in the utility of a consumer is possible without a worsening of the utility of some other consumer  this is called the first theorem of welfare economics  the basic reason is that no productive factor with a non zero marginal product is left unutilized  and the units of each factor are so allocated as to yield the same indirect marginal utility in all uses  a basic efficiency condition  if this indirect marginal utility were higher in one use than in other ones  a pareto improvement could be achieved by transferring a small amount of the factor to the use where it yields a higher marginal utility      a simple proof assuming differentiable utility functions and production functions is the following  let wj be the  price   the rental  of a certain factor j  let mpj  and mpj  be its marginal product in the production of goods   and    and let p  and p  be these goods  prices  in equilibrium these prices must equal the respective marginal costs mc  and mc   remember that marginal cost equals factor  price  divided by factor marginal productivity  because increasing the production of good by one very small unit through an increase of the employment of factor j requires increasing the factor employment by   mpji and thus increasing the cost by wj mpji  and through the condition of cost minimization that marginal products must be proportional to factor  prices  it can be shown that the cost increase is the same if the output increase is obtained by optimally varying all factors   optimal factor employment by a price taking firm requires equality of factor rental and factor marginal revenue product  wj pimpji  so we obtain p  mc  wj mpj   p  mcj  wj mpj      now choose any consumer purchasing both goods  and measure his utility in such units that in equilibrium his marginal utility of money  the increase in utility due to the last unit of money spent on each good   mu  p  mu  p   is    then p  mu   p  mu   the indirect marginal utility of the factor is the increase in the utility of our consumer achieved by an increase in the employment of the factor by one  very small  unit  this increase in utility through allocating the small increase in factor utilization to good   is mpj mu  mpj p  wj  and through allocating it to good   it is mpj mu  mpj p  wj again  with our choice of units the marginal utility of the amount of the factor consumed directly by the optimizing consumer is again w  so the amount supplied of the factor too satisfies the condition of optimal allocation     monopoly violates this optimal allocation condition  because in a monopolized industry market price is above marginal cost  and this means that factors are underutilized in the monopolized industry  they have a higher indirect marginal utility than in their uses in competitive industries  of course this theorem is considered irrelevant by economists who do not believe that general equilibrium theory correctly predicts the functioning of market economies  but it is given great importance by neoclassical economists and it is the theoretical reason given by them for combating monopolies and for antitrust legislation     in contrast to a monopoly or oligopoly  in perfect competition it is impossible for a firm to earn economic profit in the long run  which is to say that a firm cannot make any more money than is necessary to cover its economic costs  in order not to misinterpret this zero long run profits thesis  it must be remembered that the term  profit  is used in different ways     thus  if one leaves aside risk coverage for simplicity  the neoclassical zero long run profit thesis would be re expressed in classical parlance as profits coinciding with interest in the long period  i e  the rate of profit tending to coincide with the rate of interest   profits in the classical meaning do not necessarily disappear in the long period but tend to normal profit  with this terminology  if a firm is earning abnormal profit in the short term  this will act as a trigger for other firms to enter the market  as other firms enter the market  the market supply curve will shift out  causing prices to fall  existing firms will react to this lower price by adjusting their capital stock downward   this adjustment will cause their marginal cost to shift to the left causing the market supply curve to shift inward   however  the net effect of entry by new firms and adjustment by existing firms will be to shift the supply curve outward   the market price will be driven down until all firms are earning normal profit only      it is important to note that perfect competition is a sufficient condition for allocative and productive efficiency  but it is not a necessary condition  laboratory experiments in which participants have significant price setting power and little or no information about their counterparts consistently produce efficient results given the proper trading institutions       in the short run  a firm operating at a loss r   tc  revenue less than total cost  or p   atc  price less than unit cost  must decide whether to continue to operate or temporarily shutdown    the shutdown rule states  in the short run a firm should continue to operate if price exceeds average variable costs     restated  the rule is that for a firm to continue producing in the short run it must earn sufficient revenue to cover its variable costs    the rationale for the rule is straightforward  by shutting down a firm avoids all variable costs    however  the firm must still pay fixed costs    because fixed cost must be paid regardless of whether a firm operates they should not be considered in deciding whether to produce or shutdown  thus in determining whether to shut down a firm should compare total revenue to total variable costs  vc  rather than total costs  fc   vc   if the revenue the firm is receiving is greater than its total variable cost  r   vc  then the firm is covering all variable cost plus there is additional revenue   contribution    which can be applied to fixed costs   the size of the fixed costs is irrelevant as it is a sunk cost  the same consideration is used whether fixed costs are one dollar or one million dollars   on the other hand if vc   r then the firm is not even covering its production costs and it should immediately shut down  the rule is conventionally stated in terms of price  average revenue  and average variable costs  the rules are equivalent  if you divide both sides of inequality tr   tvc by q gives p   avc   if the firm decides to operate  the firm will continue to produce where marginal revenue equals marginal costs because these conditions insure not only profit maximization  loss minimization  but also maximum contribution     another way to state the rule is that a firm should compare the profits from operating to those realized if it shutdown and select the option that produces the greater profit      a firm that is shutdown is generating zero revenue and incurring no variable costs  however  the firm still has to pay fixed cost  so the firm s profit equals fixed costs or  fc    an operating firm is generating revenue  incurring variable costs and paying fixed costs  the operating firm s profit is r   vc   fc  the firm should continue to operate if r   vc   fc    fc  which simplified is r   vc      the difference between revenue  r  and variable costs  vc  is the contribution to fixed costs and any contribution is better than none  thus  if r   vc then firm should operate  if r   vc the firm should shut down     a decision to shut down means that the firm is temporarily suspending production  it does not mean that the firm is going out of business  exiting the industry     if market conditions improve  and prices increase  the firm can resume production  shutting down is a short run decision  a firm that has shut down is not producing  the firm still retains its capital assets  however  the firm cannot leave the industry or avoid its fixed costs in the short run  exit is a long term decision  a firm that has exited an industry has avoided all commitments and freed all capital for use in more profitable enterprises       however  a firm cannot continue to incur losses indefinitely  in the long run  the firm will have to earn sufficient revenue to cover all its expenses and must decide whether to continue in business or to leave the industry and pursue profits elsewhere  the long run decision is based on the relationship of the price and long run average costs  if p   ac then the firm will not exit the industry  if p   ac  then the firm will exit the industry  these comparisons will be made after the firm has made the necessary and feasible long term adjustments  in the long run a firm operates where marginal revenue equals long run marginal costs       the short run supply curve for a perfectly competitive firm is the marginal cost  mc  curve at and above the shutdown point  portions of the marginal cost curve below the shut down point are not part of the sr supply curve because the firm is not producing in that range  technically the sr supply curve is a discontinuous function composed of the segment of the mc curve at and above minimum of the average variable cost curve and a segment that runs with the vertical axis from the origin to but not including a point  parallel  to minimum average variable costs       though there is no actual perfectly competitive market in the real world  a number of approximations exist     an example is that of a large auction of identical goods with all potential buyers and sellers present  by design  a stock exchange resembles this  not as a complete description  for no markets may satisfy all requirements of the model  but as an approximation  the flaw in considering the stock exchange as an example of perfect competition is the fact that large institutional investors  e g  investment banks  may solely influence the market price  this  of course  violates the condition that  no one seller can influence market price      horse betting is also quite a close approximation  when placing bets  consumers can just look down the line to see who is offering the best odds  and so no one bookie can offer worse odds than those being offered by the market as a whole  since consumers will just go to another bookie  this makes the bookies price takers  furthermore  the product on offer is very homogeneous  with the only differences between individual bets being the pay off and the horse  of course  there are not an infinite amount of bookies  and some barriers to entry exist  such as a license and the capital required to set up     free software works along lines that approximate perfect competition as well  anyone is free to enter and leave the market at no cost  all code is freely accessible and modifiable  and individuals are free to behave independently  free software may be bought or sold at whatever price that the market may allow     some believewho  that one of the prime examples of a perfectly competitive market anywhere in the world is street food in developing countries  this is so since relatively few barriers to entry exit exist for street vendors  furthermore  there are often numerous buyers and sellers of a given street food  in addition to consumers sellers possessing perfect information of the product in question  it is often the case that street vendors may serve a homogenous product  in which little to no variations in the product s nature exist     another very near example of perfect competition would be the fish market and the vegetable or fruit vendors who sell at the same place  the bars in  le carr    li ge  belgium  or the  kebab street  near the grand place in brussels       the use of the assumption of perfect competition as the foundation of price theory for product markets is often criticized as representing all agents as passive  thus removing the active attempts to increase one s welfare or profits by price undercutting  product design  advertising  innovation  activities that   the critics argue   characterize most industries and markets  these criticisms point to the frequent lack of realism of the assumptions of product homogeneity and impossibility to differentiate it  but apart from this the accusation of passivity appears correct only for short period or very short period analyses  in long period analyses the inability of price to diverge from the natural or long period price is due to active reactions of entry or exit     some economists have a different kind of criticism concerning perfect competition model  they are not criticizing the price taker assumption because it makes economic agents too  passive   but because it then raises the question of who sets the prices  indeed  if everyone is price taker  there is the need for a benevolent planner who gives and sets the prices  in other word  there is a need for a  price maker   therefore  it makes the perfect competition model appropriate not to describe a decentralize  market  economy but a centralized one  this in turn means that such kind of model has more to do with communism than capitalism       another frequent criticism is that it is often not true that in the short run differences between supply and demand cause changes in price  especially in manufacturing  the more common behaviour is alteration of production without nearly any alteration of price       the critics of the assumption of perfect competition in product markets seldom question the basic neoclassical view of the working of market economies for this reason  the austrian school insists strongly on this criticism  and yet the neoclassical view of the working of market economies as fundamentally efficient  reflecting consumer choices and assigning to each agent his contribution to social welfare  is esteemed to be fundamentally correct    some non neoclassical schools  like post keynesians  reject the neoclassical approach to value and distribution  but not because of their rejection of perfect competition as a reasonable approximation to the working of most product markets  the reasons for rejection of the neoclassical  vision  are different views of the determinants of income distribution and of aggregated demand       in particular  the rejection of perfect competition does not generally entail the rejection of free competition as characterizing most product markets  indeed it has been argued   that competition is stronger nowadays than in   th century capitalism  owing to the increasing capacity of big conglomerate firms to enter any industry  therefore the classical idea of a tendency toward a uniform rate of return on investment in all industries owing to free entry is even more valid today  and the reason why general motors  exxon or nestle do not enter the computers or pharmaceutical industries is not insurmountable barriers to entry but rather that the rate of return in the latter industries is already sufficiently in line with the average rate of return elsewhere as not to justify entry  on this few economists  it would seem  would disagree  even among the neoclassical ones  thus when the issue is normal  or long period  product prices  differences on the validity of the perfect competition assumption do not appear to imply important differences on the existence or not of a tendency of rates of return toward uniformity as long as entry is possible  and what is found fundamentally lacking in the perfect competition model is the absence of marketing expenses and innovation as causes of costs that do enter normal average cost     the issue is different with respect to factor markets  here the acceptance or denial of perfect competition in labour markets does make a big difference to the view of the working of market economies  one must distinguish neoclassical from non neoclassical economists  for the former  absence of perfect competition in labour markets  e g  due to the existence of trade unions  impedes the smooth working of competition  which if left free to operate would cause a decrease of wages as long as there were unemployment  and would finally ensure the full employment of labour  labour unemployment is due to absence of perfect competition in labour markets  most non neoclassical economists deny that a full flexibility of wages would ensure the full employment of labour and find a stickiness of wages an indispensable component of a market economy  without which the economy would lack the regularity and persistence indispensable to its smooth working  this was  for example  john maynard keynes s opinion     particularly radical is the view of the sraffian school on this issue  the labour demand curve cannot be determined hence a level of wages ensuring the equality between supply and demand for labour does not exist  and economics should resume the viewpoint of the classical economists  according to whom competition in labour markets does not and cannot mean indefinite price flexibility as long as supply and demand are unequal  it only means a tendency to equality of wages for similar work  but the level of wages is necessarily determined by complex sociopolitical elements  custom  feelings of justice  informal allegiances to classes  as well as overt coalitions such as trade unions  far from being impediments to a smooth working of labour markets that would be able to determine wages even without these elements  are on the contrary indispensable because without them there would be no way to determine wages       equilibrium in perfect competition is the point where market demands will be equal to market supply  a firm s price will be determined at this point  in the short run  equilibrium will be affected by demand  in the long run  both demand and supply of a product will affect the equilibrium in perfect competition  a firm will receive only normal profit in the long run at the equilibrium point
