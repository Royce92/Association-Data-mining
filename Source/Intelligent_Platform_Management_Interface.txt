 the intelligent platform management interface  ipmi  is a set of computer interface specifications for an autonomous computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring capabilities independently of the host system s cpu  firmware  bios or uefi  and operating system  ipmi defines a set of interfaces used by system administrators for out of band management of computer systems and monitoring of their operation  for example  ipmi provides a way to manage a computer that may be powered off or otherwise unresponsive by using a network connection to the hardware rather than to an operating system or login shell     the development of this interface specification was led by intel corporation and is supported by more than     computer systems vendors  such as cisco  dell  hewlett packard  intel  nec corporation  supermicro and tyan              using a standardized interface and protocol allows systems management software based on ipmi to manage multiple disparate servers  as a message based  hardware level interface specification  ipmi operates independently of the operating system  os  to allow administrators to manage a system remotely in the absence of an operating system or of the system management software  thus ipmi functions can work in any of three scenarios     system administrators can use ipmi messaging to monitor platform status  such as system temperatures  voltages  fans  power supplies and chassis intrusion   to query inventory information  to review hardware logs of out of range conditions  or to perform recovery procedures such as issuing requests from a remote console through the same connections e g  system power down and rebooting  or configuring watchdog timers  the standard also defines an alerting mechanism for the system to send a simple network management protocol  snmp  platform event trap  pet      the monitored system may be powered off  but must be connected to a power source and to the monitoring medium  typically a local area network  lan  connection  ipmi can also function after the operating system has started  and exposes management data and structures to the system management software  ipmi prescribes only the structure and format of the interfaces as a standard  while detailed implementations may vary  an implementation of ipmi version     can communicate via a direct out of band local area network  lan  or serial connection or via a side band local area network  lan  connection to a remote client  the side band lan connection utilizes the board network interface controller  nic   this solution is less expensive than a dedicated lan connection but also has limited bandwidth     systems compliant with ipmi version     can also communicate via serial over lan  whereby serial console output can be remotely viewed over the lan  systems implementing ipmi     typically also include kvm over ip  remote virtual media and out of band embedded web server interface functionality  although strictly speaking  these lie outside of the scope of the ipmi interface standard     dcmi  data center management interface  is a similar standard based on ipmi but designed to be more suitable for data center management  it uses the interfaces defined in ipmi  but minimizes the number of optional interfaces and includes power capping control  among other differences     as well as using a separate dedicated management lan connection  ipmi also allows implementation of a so called  side band  management lan connection  this connection utilizes a system management bus  smbus  interface between the bmc  baseboard management controller  and the board network interface controller  nic   this solution has the advantage of reduced costs but also provides limited bandwidthxa    sufficient for text console redirection but not for video redirection  for example  when a remote computer is down the system administrator can access it through ipmi and utilize a text console     this suffices for a few vital functions  such as checking the event log  accessing the bios setup and performing power on  power off or power cycle  however  more advanced functions  such as remote re installation of an operating system  may require a full out of band management approach utilizing a dedicated lan connection citation needed    an ipmi sub system consists of a main controller  called the baseboard management controller  bmc  and other management controllers distributed among different system modules that are referred to as satellite controllers  the satellite controllers within the same chassis connect to the bmc via the system interface called intelligent platform management bus bridge  ipmb xa    an enhanced implementation of i c  inter integrated circuit   the bmc connects to satellite controllers or another bmc in another chassis via the intelligent platform management controller  ipmc  bus or bridge  it may be managed with the remote management control protocol  rmcp   a specialized wire protocol defined by this specification  rmcp   a udp based protocol with stronger authentication than rmcp  is used for ipmi over lan     several vendors develop and market bmc chips  a bmc utilized for embedded applications may have limited memory and require optimized firmware code for implementation of the full ipmi functionality  highly integrated bmcs can provide complex instructions and provide the complete out of band functionality of a service processor  the firmware implementing the ipmi interfaces is provided by various vendors  a field replaceable unit  fru  holds the inventory  such as vendor id and manufacturer  of potentially replaceable devices  a sensor data record  sdr  repository provides the properties of the individual sensors present on the board  for example  the board may contain sensors for temperature  fan speed  and voltage     the baseboard management controller  bmc  is the intelligence in the ipmi architecture  it is a specialized microcontroller embedded on the motherboard of a computer  generally a server  the bmc manages the interface between system management software and platform hardware     different types of sensors built into the computer system report to the bmc on parameters such as temperature  cooling fan speeds  power status  operating system  os  status  etc  the bmc monitors the sensors and can send alerts to a system administrator via the network if any of the parameters do not stay within preset limits  indicating a potential failure of the system  the administrator can also remotely communicate with the bmc to take some corrective action such as resetting or power cycling the system to get a hung os running again  these abilities save on the total cost of ownership of a system     physical interfaces to the bmc include smbus buses  an rs     serial console  address and data lines and an intelligent platform management bus  ipmb   that enables the bmc to accept ipmi request messages from other management controllers in the system     a direct serial connection to the bmc is not encrypted as the connection itself is secure  connection to the bmc over lan may or may not use encryption depending on the security concerns of the user     there are rising concerns about the general security regarding bmcs as a closed infrastructure          on   july       rapid   published a guide to security penetration testing of the latest ipmi     protocol and implementations by various vendors      vendors have provided patches that remediate most of the vulnerabilities  but the  ipmi     rakp authentication remote password hash retrieval  vulnerability has not yet been addressed  this arises from the difficulty that the ipmi     specification is flawed in that it reveals the password hash and salt to anonymous remote clients  this allows for offline brute force attacks  complete remediation will require a change to the ipmi specification      some sources are even advising against using ipmi at all   due to security concerns related to the design and vulnerabilities of actual baseboard management controllers  bmcs      however  like for any other management interface  good security practices dictate the placement of the ipmi management port on a dedicated management lan or vlan     the ipmi standard specification has evolved through a number of iterations
