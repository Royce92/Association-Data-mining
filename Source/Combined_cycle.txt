 in electric power generation a combined cycle is an assembly of heat engines that work in tandem from the same source of heat  converting it into mechanical energy  which in turn usually drives electrical generators  the principle is that after completing its cycle  in the first engine   the working fluid of the first heat engine is still low enough in its entropy that a second subsequent heat engine may extract energy from the waste heat  energy  of the working fluid of the first engine  by combining these multiple streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator  the overall net efficiency of the system may be increased by         percent  that is  from an overall efficiency of say      in a single cycle  to possibly an overall efficiency of      in a mechanical combination of two     cycles  in net carnot thermodynamic efficiency  this can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates  usually less than       in an ordinary  non combined cycle  heat engine the remaining heat  e g   hot exhaust fumes  from combustion is generally wasted     combining two or more thermodynamic cycles results in improved overall efficiency  reducing fuel costs  in stationary power plants  a widely used combination is a gas turbine  operating by the brayton cycle  burning natural gas or synthesis gas from coal  whose hot exhaust powers a steam power plant  operating by the rankine cycle   this is called a combined cycle gas turbine  ccgt  plant  and can achieve a best of class real  hhv   see below  thermal efficiency of around     in base load operation  in contrast to a single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around         many new gas power plants in north america and europe are of this type  such an arrangement is also used for marine propulsion  and is called a combined gas and steam  cogas  plant  multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common     other historically successful combined cycles have used hot cycles with mercury vapor turbines  magnetohydrodynamic generators or molten carbonate fuel cells  with steam plants for the low temperature  bottoming  cycle  bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser s heat exhaust are theoretically possible  but uneconomical because of the very large  expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water  however  it is common in cold climates  such as finland  to drive community heating systems from a power plant s condenser heat  such cogeneration systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above         in automotive and aeronautical engines  turbines have been driven from the exhausts of otto and diesel cycles  these are called turbo compound engines  not to be confused with turbochargers              the thermodynamic cycle of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles  one is the joule or brayton cycle which is a gas turbine cycle and the other is rankine cycle which is a steam turbine cycle   the cycle           which is the gas turbine power plant cycle is the topping cycle  it depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in high temperature region     the cycle a b c d e f a which is the rankine steam cycle takes place at a low temperature and is known as the bottoming cycle  transfer of heat energy from high temperature exhaust gas to water and steam takes place by a waste heat recovery boiler in the bottoming cycle  during the constant pressure process     the exhaust gases in the gas turbine reject heat  the feed water  wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a b  b c and c d     the steam power plant gets its input heat from the high temperature exhaust gases from gas turbine power plant   the steam thus generated thus can be used to drive steam turbine  the waste heat recovery boiler  whrb  has   sections  economiser  evaporator and superheater     the efficiency of a heat engine  the fraction of input heat energy that can be converted to useful work  is limited by the temperature difference between the heat entering the engine and the exhaust heat leaving the engine     in a thermal power station  water is the working medium  high pressure steam requires strong  bulky components  high temperatures require expensive alloys made from nickel or cobalt  rather than inexpensive steel  these alloys limit practical steam temperatures to    xa  c while the lower temperature of a steam plant is fixed by the temperature of the cooling water  with these limits  a steam plant has a fixed upper efficiency of     to         an open circuit gas turbine cycle has a compressor  a combustor and a turbine  for gas turbines the amount of metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small  and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used  in this type of cycle  the input temperature to the turbine  the firing temperature   is relatively high      to      xa  c   the output temperature of the flue gas is also high      to    xa  c   this is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid  a rankine cycle      in a combined cycle power plant  the heat of the gas turbine s exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a heat recovery steam generator  hrsg  with a live steam temperature between     and    xa  c  the condenser of the rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake  river  sea or cooling towers  this temperature can be as low as   xa  c     for large scale power generation  a typical set would be a    xa mw gas turbine coupled to a    xa mw steam turbine giving    xa mw  a typical power station might consist of between   and   such sets     plant size is important in the cost of the plant  the larger plant sizes benefit from economies of scale  lower initial cost per kilowatt  and improved efficiency     gas turbines of about     mw size are already in operation manufactured by at least four separate groups   general electric and its licensees  alstom  siemens  and westinghouse mitsubishi  these groups are also developing  testing and or marketing gas turbine sizes of about     mw  combined cycle units are made up of one or more such gas turbines  each with a waste heat steam generator arranged to supply steam to a single steam turbine  thus forming a combined cycle block or unit  typical combined cycle block sizes offered by three major manufacturers  alstom  general electric and siemens  are roughly in the range of    mw to     mw and costs are about      kw     the heat recovery boiler is item   in the cogas figure shown above  no combustion of fuel means that there is no need of fuel handling plant and it is simply a heat exchanger  exhaust enters in super heater and the evaporator and then in to economiser section as it flows out from the boiler  feed water comes in through the economizer and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit  finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater  if the temperature of the gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher  then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high      it is often desirable if high heat is recovered from the exiting gases  hence dual pressure boiler is employed for this purpose  it has two water steam drums  low pressure drum is connected to low pressure economizer or evaporator  the low pressure steam is generated in low temperature zone  the low pressure steam is supplied to the low temperature turbine  super heater can be provided in the low pressure circuit     some part of the feed water from the low pressure zone is transferred to the high pressure economizer by a booster pump  this economizer heats up the water to its saturation temperature  this saturated water goes through the high temperature zone of the boiler and is supplied to the high pressure turbine     supplementary firing may be used in combined cycles  in the hrsg  raising exhaust temperatures from    xa  c  gt exhaust  to     or even     xa  c  using supplemental firing will however not raise the combined cycle efficiency for most combined cycles  for single boilers it may raise the efficiency if fired to        xa  c  for multiple boilers however  supplemental firing is often used to improve peak power production of the unit  or to enable higher steam production to compensate for failure of a second unit     maximum supplementary firing refers to the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust  the steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration  hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air  regenerative air preheater is not required  a fresh air fan which makes it possible to operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation  increases the availability of the unit     the use of large supplementary firing in combined cycle systems with high gas turbine inlet temperatures causes the efficiency to drop  for this reason the combined cycle plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today  in comparison to simple combined cycle installations  however  they have two advantages that is a  coal can be burned in the steam generator as the supplementary fuel  b  has very good part load efficiency     the hrsg can be designed with supplementary firing of fuel after the gas turbine in order to increase the quantity or temperature of the steam generated  without supplementary firing  the efficiency of the combined cycle power plant is higher  but supplementary firing lets the plant respond to fluctuations of electrical load  supplementary burners are also called duct burners     more fuel is sometimes added to the turbine s exhaust  this is possible because the turbine exhaust gas  flue gas  still contains some oxygen  temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use excess air  above the optimal stoichiometric ratio to burn the fuel  often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner and is used to cool the turbine blades     supplementary firing raises the temperature of the exhaust gas from     to     degree celsius  relatively high flue gas temperature raises the condition of steam     bar      degree celsius  thereby improving the efficiency of steam cycle     the turbines used in combined cycle plants are commonly fueled with natural gas  the improvement in shale gas extraction has increased gas supplies and reserves dramatically   because of this fact  it is becoming the fuel of choice for an increasing amount of private investors and consumers because it is more versatile than coal or oil and can be used in     of energy applications  chile which once depended on hydro power for     of its electricity supply  is now boosting its gas supplies to reduce reliance on its drought afflicted hydro dams  similarly china is tapping its gas reserves to reduce reliance on coal  which is currently burned to generate     of the country s electricity supply     where the extension of a gas pipeline is impractical or cannot be economically justified  electricity needs in remote areas can be met with small scale combined cycle plants  using renewable fuels  instead of natural gas  combined cycle plants can be filled with biogas derived from agricultural and forestry waste  which is often readily available in rural areas     combined cycle plants are usually powered by natural gas  although fuel oil  synthesis gas or other fuels can be used  the supplementary fuel may be natural gas  fuel oil  or coal  biofuels can also be used  integrated solar combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact  look iscc section   next generation nuclear power plants are also on the drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the brayton top cycle  as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a rankine bottoming cycle     gas turbines burn mainly natural gas and light oil  crude oil  residual  and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment  in addition  ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to    percent  they may still be economically attractive fuels however  particularly in combined cycle plants     sodium and potassium are removed from residual  crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure  a simpler and less expensive purification system will do the same job for light crude and light distillates  a magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present  fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable  low maintenance operation of gas turbines     a single shaft combined cycle plant comprises a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator  in a multi shaft combined cycle plant  each gas turbine and each steam turbine has its own generator  the single shaft design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators  the multi shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate in conjunction with a single steam turbine  which can be more economical than a number of single shaft units     the primary disadvantage of single shaft combined cycle power plants is that the number of steam turbines  condensers and condensate systems   and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems   increases to match the number of gas turbines  for a multi shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine  condenser and the rest of the heat sink for up to three gas turbines  only their size increases  having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale  a larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle  thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical     the combined cycle system includes single shaft and multi shaft configurations  the single shaft system consists of one gas turbine  one steam turbine  one generator and one heat recovery steam generator  hrsg   with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled to the single generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft  key advantages of the single shaft arrangement are operating simplicity  smaller footprint  and lower startup cost  single shaft arrangements  however  will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi shaft blocks  additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected  using a synchro self shifting  sss  clutch   for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine     multi shaft systems have one or more gas turbine generators and hrsgs that supply steam through a common header to a separate single steam turbine generator  in terms of overall investment a multi shaft system is about    higher in costs     single  and multiple pressure non reheat steam cycles are applied to combined cycle systems equipped with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately    xa  c or less  selection of a single  or multiple pressure steam cycle for a specific application is determined by economic evaluation which considers plant installed cost  fuel cost and quality  plant duty cycle  and operating and maintenance cost     multiple pressure reheat steam cycles are applied to combined cycle systems with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately    xa  c     the most efficient power generation cycles are those with unfired hrsgs with modular pre engineered components  these unfired steam cycles are also the lowest in cost  supplementary fired combined cycle systems are provided for specific application     the primary regions of interest for cogeneration combined cycle systems are those with unfired and supplementary fired steam cycles  these systems provide a wide range of thermal energy to electric power ratio and represent the range of thermal energy capability and power generation covered by the product line for thermal energy and power systems     to avoid confusion  the efficiency of heat engines and power stations should be stated hhv  aka higher heating value  or lhv  aka lower heating value  to exclude  or include respectively the heat and power that can be obtained from condensing the flue gas  and gross output at the generator terminals or net output at the power station fence are being considered     the lhv figure is not a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input  it is     higher than that  the hhv figure is a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input  if the lhv approach were used for some new condensing boilers  the efficiency would calculate to be over       manufacturers prefer to cite the higher lhv efficiency  e g       for a new ccgt  but utilities  when calculated how much electricity the plant will generate  divide this by      to get the real  e g       hhv efficiency of that ccgt  coal plant efficiencies are computed on a hhv basis  it doesn t make nearly as much difference for coal burn  as for gas      the difference between hhv and lhv for gas  can be estimated  using usa units  by     btu lb   w  where w is the lbs of water after combustion per lb of fuel  to convert the hhv of natural gas  which is       btu lb  to an lhv  methane is     hydrogen  would be                                    because the efficiency is determined by dividing the energy output by the input  and the input on an lhv basis is smaller than the hhv basis  the overall efficiency on an lhv basis is higher  so  using the ratio                     you can convert the hhv to an lhv     so a real best of class baseload ccgt efficiency of      as experienced by the utility operating the plant  translates to     lhv as the manufacturer s published headline ccgt efficiency     in general in service combined cycle efficiencies are over    percent on a lower heating value and gross output basis  most combined cycle units  especially the larger units  have peak  steady state efficiencies on the lhv  marketing figure  basis of    to      research aimed at     xa  c      xa  f  turbine inlet temperature has led to even more efficient combined cycles and nearly    percent lhv efficiency      hhv efficiency  has been reached in the combined cycle unit of baglan bay  a ge h technology gas turbine with a nem   pressure reheat boiler  utilising steam from the hrsg to cool the turbine blades  siemens ag announced in may      to have achieved a        net efficiency with a     megawatts sgt      h gas turbine at the irsching power station      by combining both gas and steam cycles  high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved  the efficiency of the cycles add  because they are powered by the same fuel source  so  a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas turbine s high firing temperature and the waste heat temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle  this large range means that the carnot efficiency of the cycle is high  the actual efficiency  while lower than this  is still higher than that of either plant on its own   the actual efficiency achievable is a complex area      the electric efficiency of a combined cycle power station  if calculated as electric energy produced as a percent of the lower heating value of the fuel consumed  may be as high as    percent when operating new  i e  unaged  and at continuous output which are ideal conditions  as with single cycle thermal units  combined cycle units may also deliver low temperature heat energy for industrial processes  district heating and other uses  this is called cogeneration and such power plants are often referred to as a combined heat and power  chp  plant     the efficiency of ccgt and gt can be boosted by pre cooling combustion air  this is practised in hot climates and also has the effect of increasing power output  this is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in front of the turbine  or by using ice storage air conditioning  the latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available  furthermore  ice storage can be used as a means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and  potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods     an integrated gasification combined cycle  or igcc  is a power plant using synthesis gas  syngas   syngas can be produced from a number of sources  including coal and biomass  the system utilizes gas and steam turbines  the steam turbine operating off of the heat leftover from the gas turbine  this process can raise electricity generation efficiency to around         an integrated solar combined cycle is a hybrid technology in which a solar field is integrated within a combined cycle plant  in iscc plants  solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply  supporting the steam cycle  which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use      thermodynamic benefits are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated citation needed major factors limiting the load output of a combined cycle power plant are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the heat recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system  those limitations also influence the fast start up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times  and waiting gas turbines consume gas  the solar component  if the plant is started after sunshine  or before  if we have heat storage  allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions  that is  the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions    economic benefits are that the solar components costs are     to     those of a solar energy generating systems plant of the same collector surface      the first such system to come online was the archimede solar power plant  italy in         followed by martin next generation solar energy center in florida  and in      by the kuraymat iscc power plant in egypt  yazd power plant in iran      hassi r mel in algeria  ain beni mathar in morocco     combined cycles have traditionally only been used in large power plants  bmw  however  has proposed that automobiles use exhaust heat to drive steam turbines    this can even be connected to the car or truck s cooling system to save space and weight  but also to provide a condenser in the same location as the radiator and preheating of the water using heat from the engine block     it may be possible to use the pistons in a reciprocating engine for both combustion and steam expansion as in the crower engine       a turbocharged car is also a combined cycle  bowman of southampton offer a commercially proven add on turbocharger which additionally can generate electric power lowering overall fuel consumption by about    citation needed    some versions of the wright r      were produced as turbo compound engines  three turbines driven by exhaust gases  known as power recovery turbines  provided nearly    xa hp at takeoff  these turbines added power to the engine crankshaft through bevel gears and fluid couplings       they have been many successful turbo compound engine designs particularly for aircraft but their mechanical
