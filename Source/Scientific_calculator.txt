 a scientific calculator is a type of electronic calculator  usually but not always handheld  designed to calculate problems in science  engineering  and mathematics  they have almost completely replaced slide rules in almost all traditional applications  and are widely used in both education and professional settings     in certain contexts such as higher education  scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators  which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device  there is also some overlap with the financial calculator market             modern scientific calculators generally have many more features than a standard four or five function calculator  and the feature set differs between manufacturers and models  however  the defining features of a scientific calculator include     in addition  high end scientific calculators will include     while most scientific models have traditionally used a single line display similar to traditional pocket calculators  many of them have at the very least more digits     to      sometimes with extra digits for the floating point exponent  a few have multi line displays  with some recent models from hewlett packard  texas instruments  casio  sharp  and canon using dot matrix displays similar to those found on graphing calculators     scientific calculators are used widely in any situation where quick access to certain mathematical functions is needed  especially those such as trigonometric functions that were once traditionally looked up in tables  they are also used in situations requiring back of the envelope calculations of very large numbers  as in some aspects of astronomy  physics  and chemistry     they are very often required for math classes from the junior high school level through college  and are generally either permitted or required on many standardized tests covering math and science subjects  as a result  many are sold into educational markets to cover this demand  and some high end models include features making it easier to translate the problem on a textbook page into calculator input  from allowing explicit operator precedence using parentheses to providing a method for the user to enter an entire problem in as it is written on the page using simple formatting tools     the first scientific calculator that included all of the basic features above was the programmable hewlett packard hp     a   released in       though the wang loci   and the mathatronics mathatron had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs  the hp      series was built entirely from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits  and was one of the first uses of the cordic algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device  as well as the first calculator based on reverse polish notation  rpn  entry  hp became closely identified with rpn calculators from then on  and even today some of their high end calculators  particularly the long lived hp   c financial calculator and the hp    series of graphing calculators  still offer rpn as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following     the hp     introduced on february          was hewlett packard s first pocket calculator and the world s first handheld scientific calculator   like some of hp s desktop calculators it used rpn  introduced at us      the hp    was available from      to          texas instruments  ti   after the introduction of several units with scientific notation  came out with a handheld scientific calculator on january          in the form of the sr      ti continues to be a major player in the calculator market  with their long running ti    series being one of the most widely used scientific calculators in classrooms     casio and sharp have also been major players  with casio s fx series  beginning with the casio fx   in        being a very common brand  used particularly in schools  casio is also a major player in the graphing calculator market  and was the first company to produce one  casio fx     g
