 converged infrastructure operates by grouping multiple information technology  it  components into a single  optimized computing package  components of a converged infrastructure may include servers  data storage devices  networking equipment and software for it infrastructure management  automation and orchestration     it organizations use converged infrastructure to centralize the management of it resources  to consolidate systems  to increase resource utilization rates  and to lower costs  converged infrastructures foster these objectives by implementing pools of computers  storage and networking resources that can be shared by multiple applications and managed in a collective manner using policy driven processes citation needed    it vendors and it industry analysts use various terms to describe the concept of a converged infrastructure  these include  converged system    unified computing    fabric based computing   and  dynamic infrastructure              historically  to keep pace with the growth of business applications and the terabytes of data they generate  it resources were deployed in a silo like fashion  one set of resources has been devoted to one particular computing technology  business application or line of business  these resources support a single set of assumptions and cannot be optimized or reconfigured to support varying usage loads     the proliferation of it sprawl in data centers has contributed to rising operations costs  reducing productivity  and stifling agility and flexibility  maintenance and operations can consume two thirds of an organization s technology budget  according to a        informationweek survey of executives in     companies with annual revenue over      million  that leaves just a third of the budget for new it initiatives  this ratio prevents it from supporting new business initiatives or responding to real application demands     a converged infrastructure addresses the problem of siloed architectures and it sprawl by pooling and sharing it resources  rather than dedicating a set of resources to a particular computing technology  application or line of business  converged infrastructure creates a pool of virtualized server  storage and networking capacity that is shared by multiple applications and lines of business     converged infrastructure provides both technical and business efficiencies  according to industry researchers and observers   these gains stem in part from the pre integration of technology components  the pooling of it resources and the automation of it processes  converged infrastructure further contributes to efficient data centers by enhancing the ability of cloud computing systems to handle enormous data sets  using only a single integrated it management system      writing in cio magazine  forrester research analyst robert whiteley noted that converged infrastructures  combining server  storage  and networks into a single framework  help to transform the economics of running the datacenter thus accelerating the transition to ip storage to help build infrastructures that are  cloud ready    the combination of storage and compute into a single entity is known as converged storage      decreased complexity  through the use of pre integrated hardware with virtualization and automation management tools  is another important value proposition for converged infrastructure as noted in an idc study      in april       the open source analyst firm wikibon released the first market forecast for converged infrastructure   with a projected     b total available market  tam  by      of which  nearly    rds of the infrastructure that supports enterprise applications will be packaged in some type of converged solution by          informationweek  highlighted the promise of two long term advantages of a unified data center infrastructure     data centers around the world are reaching limits in power  cooling and space   at the same time  capital constraints are requiring organizations to rethink data center strategy  converged infrastructure offers a solution to these challenges     converged infrastructure can serve as an enabling platform for private and public cloud computing services  including infrastructure as a service  iaas   platform as a service  paas   and software as a service  saas  offerings     several characteristics make converged infrastructure well suited to cloud deployments  these include the ability to pool it resources  to automate resource provisioning and to scale up and down capacity quickly to meet the needs of dynamic computing workloads     vce  cisco  emc  huawei technologies  amax information technologies  dell  nutanix  hewlett packard  hitachi data systems  oracle  simplivity and ibm are some of the companies that provide converged infrastructure solutions
