 carbon monoxide  co  is a colorless  odorless  and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air  it is toxic to humans when encountered in concentrations above about    ppm  although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities  and is thought to have some normal biological functions  in the atmosphere  it is spatially variable and short lived  having a role in the formation of ground level ozone     carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom  connected by a triple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent bond  it is the simplest oxocarbon  and isoelectronic with the cyanide ion and molecular nitrogen  in coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl     carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon containing compounds  it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide  co    such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space  in the presence of oxygen  including atmospheric concentrations  carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame  producing carbon dioxide   coal gas  which was widely used before the     s for domestic lighting  cooking  and heating  had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent  some processes in modern technology  such as iron smelting  still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct      worldwide  the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin  due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about        kilograms per year   other natural sources of co include volcanoes  forest fires  and other forms of combustion     in biology  carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase   and   on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown  this process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons  even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide  following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in         as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body  the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide   carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator  in many tissues  all three gases are known to act as anti inflammatories  vasodilators  and promoters of neovascular growth   clinical trials of small amounts of carbon monoxide as a drug are ongoing              aristotle          bc  first recorded that burning coals emanated toxic fumes  an ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smouldering coals  what was not known was the mechanism of death  greek physician galen          ad  speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled    in       the french chemist de lassone produced co by heating zinc oxide with coke  but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen  as it burned with a blue flame  the gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by the scottish chemist william cumberland cruikshank in the year           its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by claude bernard around            during world war ii  a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep motor vehicles running in parts of the world where gasoline and diesel fuel were scarce  external  with a few exceptions  charcoal or wood gas generators were fitted  and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen  carbon monoxide  and small amounts of other gases produced by gasification was piped to a gas mixer  the gas mixture produced by this process is known as wood gas  carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during the holocaust at some nazi extermination camps  the most notable by gas vans in chelmno  and in the action t   euthanasia  program       carbon monoxide has a molar mass of       which makes it slightly lighter than air  whose average molar mass is       according to the ideal gas law  co is therefore less dense than air     the bond length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is       pm      this bond length is consistent with a triple bond  as in molecular nitrogen  n    which has a similar bond length and nearly the same molecular mass  carbon oxygen double bonds are significantly longer        pm in formaldehyde  for example    the boiling point     k  and melting point     k  are very similar to those of n      k and    k  respectively   the bond dissociation energy of      kj mol is stronger than that of n       kj mol  and represents the strongest chemical bond known       the ground electronic state of carbon monoxide is a singlet state   since there are no unpaired electrons     carbon and oxygen together have a total of    valence electrons in carbon monoxide  to satisfy the octet rule for the carbon  the two atoms form a triple bond  with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals  rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds  since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon  one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen  forming a dative or dipolar bond  this causes a c   o polarization of the molecule  with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen  the other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen  forming  polar  covalent bonds with a reverse c   o polarization  since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon  in the free carbon monoxide  a net negative charge    remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of       d       the molecule is therefore asymmetric  oxygen has more electron density than carbon  and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative  by contrast  the isoelectronic dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment     if carbon monoxide acts as a ligand  the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end  depending on the structure of the coordination complex    see also the section  coordination chemistry  below     theoretical and experimental studies show that  despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen  the dipole moment points from the more negative carbon end to the more positive oxygen end      the three bonds are in fact polar covalent bonds that are strongly polarized  the calculated polarization toward the oxygen atom is     for the   bond and     for both   bonds       the oxidation state of carbon in carbon monoxide is    in each of these structures  it is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen  only the two non bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon  in this count  carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom     carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries    carbon monoxide is colorless  odorless  and tasteless  but highly toxic  it combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin  which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen  but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues  concentrations as low as     ppm may cause up to     of the body s hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin    a level of     carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure  coma  and fatality  in the united states  the osha limits long term workplace exposure levels above    ppm    within short time scales  carbon monoxide absorption is cumulative  since the half life is about   hours in fresh air     the most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections  including symptoms such as headache  nausea  vomiting  dizziness  fatigue  and a feeling of weakness  affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning  infants may be irritable and feed poorly  neurological signs include confusion  disorientation  visual disturbance  syncope and seizures       some descriptions of carbon monoxide poisoning include retinal hemorrhages  and an abnormal cherry red blood hue    in most clinical diagnoses these signs are seldom noticed    one difficulty with the usefulness of this cherry red effect is that it corrects  or masks  what would otherwise be an unhealthy appearance  since the chief effect of removing deoxygenated hemoglobin is to make an asphyxiated person appear more normal  or a dead person appear more lifelike  similar to the effect of red colorants in embalming fluid  the  false  or unphysiologic red coloring effect in anoxic co poisoned tissue is related to the meat coloring commercial use of carbon monoxide  discussed below     carbon monoxide also binds to other molecules such as myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase  exposures to carbon monoxide may cause significant damage to the heart and central nervous system  especially to the globus pallidus    often with long term chronic pathological conditions  carbon monoxide may have severe adverse effects on the fetus of a pregnant woman       carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a signaling molecule  thus  carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body  such as a neurotransmitter or a blood vessel relaxant    because of carbon monoxide s role in the body  abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases  including neurodegenerations  hypertension  heart failure  and inflammation       carbon monoxide is a nutrient for methanogenic archaea    a building block for acetylcoenzyme a  this is the theme for the emerging field of bioorganometallic chemistry  extremophile micro organisms can  thus  metabolise carbon monoxide in such locations as the thermal vents of volcanoes       in bacteria  carbon monoxide is produced via the reduction of carbon dioxide by the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase  an fe ni s containing protein       cooa is a carbon monoxide sensor protein    the scope of its biological role is still unknown  it may be part of a signaling pathway in bacteria and archaea  its occurrence in mammals is not established     carbon monoxide occurs in various natural and artificial environments  typical concentrations in parts per million are as follows     carbon monoxide is present in small amounts in the atmosphere  chiefly as a product of volcanic activity but also from natural and man made fires  such as forest and bushfires  burning of crop residues  and sugarcane fire cleaning   the burning of fossil fuels also contributes to carbon monoxide production  carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the earth s mantle    because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year  it is extremely difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas     carbon monoxide has an indirect radiative forcing effect by elevating concentrations of methane and tropospheric ozone through chemical reactions with other atmospheric constituents  e g   the hydroxyl radical  oh   that would otherwise destroy them    through natural processes in the atmosphere  it is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide  carbon monoxide concentrations are both short lived in the atmosphere and spatially variable     in the atmosphere of venus carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than     nm     due to its long lifetime in the mid troposphere  carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes       carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas  chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines  including vehicles  portable and back up generators  lawn mowers  power washers  etc    but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels  including wood  coal  charcoal  oil  paraffin  propane  natural gas  and trash      large co pollution events can be observed from space over cities       carbon monoxide is  along with aldehydes  part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form photochemical smog  it reacts with hydroxyl radical   oh  to produce a radical intermediate  hoco  which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to o  to form peroxy radical  ho    and carbon dioxide  co      peroxy radical subsequently reacts with nitrogen oxide  no  to form nitrogen dioxide  no   and hydroxyl radical  no  gives o  p  via photolysis  thereby forming o  following reaction with o   since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of no   the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is      where h  refers to the photon of light absorbed by the no  molecule in the sequence     although the creation of no  is the critical step leading to low level ozone formation  it also increases this ozone in another  somewhat mutually exclusive way  by reducing the quantity of no that is available to react with ozone       in closed environments  the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels  on average      people in the united states die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non automotive consumer products    however  according to the florida department of health   every year more than     americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the u s  require emergency medical care for non fatal carbon monoxide poisoning    these products include malfunctioning fuel burning appliances such as furnaces  ranges  water heaters  and gas and kerosene room heaters  engine powered equipment such as portable generators  fireplaces  and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas  the american association of poison control centers  aapcc  reported        cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in    deaths in         in       the cpsc reported    generator related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths    forty seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather  including hurricane katrina    still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non consumer products  such as cars left running in attached garages  the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning       carbon monoxide is absorbed through breathing and enters the blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs  it is also produced in hemoglobim metabolism and enters the blood from the tissues  and thus is present in all normal tissues  even if not inhaled     normal circulating levels in the blood are    to     and are higher in smokers  carbon monoxide levels cannot be assessed through a physical exam  laboratory testing requires a blood sample  arterial or venous  and laboratory analysis on a co oximeter  additionally  a noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin  spco  test method from pulse co oximetry exists and has been validated compared to invasive methods       outside of earth  carbon monoxide is the second most common molecule in the interstellar medium  after molecular hydrogen  because of its asymmetry  the carbon monoxide molecule produces far brighter spectral lines than the hydrogen molecule  making co much easier to detect  interstellar co was first detected with radio telescopes in       it is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies  as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light  which requires space telescopes  carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the molecular clouds in which most stars form       beta pictoris  the second brightest star in the constellation pictor  shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type  which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas  including carbon monoxide      near the star     many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide s production       a major industrial source of co is producer gas  a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen  formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon  in an oven  air is passed through a bed of coke  the initially produced co  equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give co  the reaction of co  with carbon to give co is described as the boudouard reaction    above    xa  c  co is the predominant product     another source is  water gas   a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of steam and carbon     other similar  synthesis gases  can be obtained from natural gas and other fuels     carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal oxide ores with carbon  shown in a simplified form as follows     carbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air     since co is a gas  the reduction process can be driven by heating  exploiting the positive  favorable  entropy of reaction  the ellingham diagram shows that co formation is favored over co  in high temperatures     carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the dehydration of formic acid or oxalic acid  for example with concentrated sulfuric acid        another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered zinc metal and calcium carbonate  which releases co and leaves behind zinc oxide and calcium oxide     silver nitrate and iodoform also afford carbon monoxide     most metals form coordination complexes containing covalently attached carbon monoxide  only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide ligands  this is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate back donation from the metal dxz orbital  to the   molecular orbital from co  the lone pair on the carbon atom in co  also donates electron density to the dx  y  on the metal to form a sigma bond  this electron donation is also exhibited with the cis effect  or the labilization of co ligands in the cis position  nickel carbonyl  for example  forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and nickel metal     for this reason  nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide  nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to ni and co upon contact with hot surfaces  and this method is used for the industrial purification of nickel in the mond process       in nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls  the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal  the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal  in these situations  carbon monoxide is called the carbonyl ligand  one of the most important metal carbonyls is iron pentacarbonyl  fe co            many metal co complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents  not from co  for instance  iridium trichloride and triphenylphosphine react in boiling   methoxyethanol or dmf to afford ircl co  pph        metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using infrared spectroscopy     in the presence of strong acids and water  carbon monoxide reacts with alkenes to form carboxylic acids in a process known as the koch haaf reaction    in the gattermann koch reaction  arenes are converted to benzaldehyde derivatives in the presence of alcl  and hcl    organolithium compounds  e g  butyl lithium  react with carbon monoxide  but these reactions have little scientific use     although co reacts with carbocations and carbanions  it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts       with main group reagents  co undergoes several noteworthy reactions  chlorination of co is the industrial route to the important compound phosgene  with borane co forms an adduct  h bco  which is isoelectronic with the acylium cation h cco   co reacts with sodium to give products resulting from c c coupling such as sodium acetylenediolate  na  cn o  n   it reacts with molten potassium to give a mixture of an organometallic compound  potassium acetylenediolate  k  cn o  n   potassium benzenehexolate  k  cn o  n     and potassium rhodizonate  k  cn o  n        the compounds cyclohexanehexone or triquinoyl  c o   and cyclopentanepentone or leuconic acid  c o    which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts  can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide     at pressures of over   gigapascals  carbon monoxide converts into a solid polymer of carbon and oxygen  this is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is a powerful explosive         carbon monoxide is an industrial gas that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing    large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the hydroformylation reaction of alkenes  carbon monoxide  and h   hydroformylation is coupled to the shell higher olefin process to give precursors to detergents     phosgene  useful for preparing isocyanates  polycarbonates  and polyurethanes  is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of porous activated carbon  which serves as a catalyst  world production of this compound was estimated to be      million tonnes in            methanol is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide  in a related reaction  the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to c c bond formation  as in the fischer tropsch process where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels  this technology allows coal or biomass to be converted to diesel     in the monsanto process  carbon monoxide and methanol react in the presence of a homogeneous rhodium catalyst and hydroiodic acid to give acetic acid  this process is responsible for most of the industrial production of acetic acid     an industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying nickel in the mond process     carbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the us  mainly with fresh meat products such as beef  pork  and fish to keep them looking fresh  the carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin  a bright cherry red pigment  carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin  oxymyoglobin  which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin  this stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat    typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between      to          the technology was first given  generally recognized as safe   gras  status by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  in      for use as a secondary packaging system  and does not require labeling  in       the fda approved co as primary packaging method  declaring that co does not mask spoilage odor    despite this ruling  the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage      in       a bill   was introduced to the united states house of representatives to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive  but the bill died in subcommittee  the process is banned in many other countries  including japan  singapore  and the european union           in biology  carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of heme oxygenase   and   on the heme from hemoglobin breakdown  this process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons  even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide     following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in         as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body  the other two being nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide   carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator  in many tissues  all three gases are known to act as anti inflammatories  vasodilators  and encouragers of neovascular growth   however  the issues are complex  as neovascular growth is not always beneficial  since it plays a role in tumor growth  and also the damage from wet macular degeneration  a disease for which smoking  a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood  several times more than natural production  increases the risk from   to   times     there is a theory that  in some nerve cell synapses  when long term memories are being laid down  the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide  which back transmits to the transmitting cell  telling it to transmit more readily in future  some such nerve cells have been shown to contain guanylate cyclase  an enzyme that is activated by carbon monoxide      studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti inflammatory and cytoprotective properties  these properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury  transplant rejection  atherosclerosis  severe sepsis  severe malaria  or autoimmunity  clinical tests involving humans have been performed  however the results have not yet been released      carbon monoxide has also been used as a lasing medium in high powered infrared lasers       carbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on mars  carbon monoxide oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the atmosphere of mars by zirconia electrolysis  without using any martian water resources to obtain hydrogen  which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen based fuel
