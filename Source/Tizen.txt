governed by a technical steering group  tsg  composed of samsung and intel among others     tizen s licensing model involves software that uses a variety of licenses that may be incompatible with the open source definition  see licensing model below   and a proprietary software development kit  sdk      the tizen association was formed to guide the industry role of tizen  including requirements gathering  identifying and facilitating service models  and overall industry marketing and education   members of the tizen association represent every major sector of the mobility industry and every

a   panasonic mobile communications  samsung  sk telecom  sprint corporation and vodafone   while the tizen association decides what needs to be done in tizen  the technical steering group determines what code is actually incorporated into the operating system to accomplish those goals  tizen roots back to the samsung linux platform  slp  and the limo project and in      samsung merged its homegrown bada project into tizen      the first week of october       samsung s nx   m smart camera became the first consumer product based on tizen  it was sold in south korea for a month before its

facilitating service models and overall industry marketing and education     tizen provides application development tools based on the javascript libraries jquery and jquery mobile  since version      a native application framework is also available  based on an open services platform from the bada platform     the software development kit  sdk  allows developers to use html  and related web technologies to write applications that run on supported devices     the core mobile web platform community group    coremob  brings developers  equipment manufacturers  browser vendors and operators together to agree on core features that developers can depend on     html  applications run on tizen  android  firefox os  ubuntu touch  windows phone  and webos without a browser     in late january       tizen     scored highest at the time in an html  test of any browsers    as the old html  tests were phased out on november           tizen     fell below blackberry      at     out of     points    however  as of december     update desktop browsers had regained the advantage  and results for tizen     on a samsung device score highest overall in mobile  with a score of     points       tizen ivi  in vehicle infotainment  is an operating system from the automotive grade linux workgroup    it is pc compatible     applications based on qt  gtk  and efl frameworks can run on tizen ivi    while there is no official support for these third party frameworks  according to the explanation on the tizen sdk web site    tizen applications for mobile devices can be developed without relying on an official tizen ide as long as the application complies with tizen packaging rules  in may       a community port of qt to tizen focused on delivering native gui controls and integration of qt with tizen os features for smartphones    based on the qt port to tizen  tizen and mer can interchange code citation needed    tizen   x has a complicated licensing model  in part due to the patent troll problem that exists in the global smartphone market    while apple has pursued patent litigation and even transferred some to known trolls   to pursue tizen partners  htc  lg  samsung  and more   by

a number of components internally developed by samsung  e g   boot animation  calendar  task manager  music player applications  are  however  released under the flora license  essentially a bsd  or apache style license except granting patents to  tizen certified platform  only     flora is not approved by the open source initiative    therefore  it is unclearcitation needed whether developers can legally use the native application framework and its graphical components to make gpl applications  source code access is guaranteed however     its sdk is built on top of open source components    but the entire sdk has been published under a non open source samsung license       tizen comes from a long history of linux adoption by manufacturers  a complete family tree is available       samsung s collaboration with the efl project  and especially carsten haitzler  was known as limo for years  it was renamed tizen when intel joined the project in september       after leaving the
