 the rackspace cloud is a set of cloud computing products and services billed on a utility computing basis from the us based company rackspace  offerings include web application hosting or platform as a service   cloud sites    cloud storage   cloud files    virtual private server   cloud servers    load balancers  databases  backup  and monitoring             rackspace cloud announced mosso llc in march        as a wholly owned subsidiary billed as a utility computing offering    as it pre dated mainstream adoption of the term cloud computing  it was  retooled  and relaunched on february           adopting the tagline  mosso  the hosting cloud    the  mosso  branding  including the mosso com domain  was then dropped on june          in favour of  the rackspace cloud  branding  including the rackspacecloud com domain name     since then  customer contracts were executed with rackspace us  inc  d b a the rackspace cloud rather than with the mosso llc subsidiary      other companies  such as emc corporation with its  decho  subsidiary  also use alternative branding for their cloud computing offerings     in       the  rackspace cloud  brand merged with rackspace com  in       rackspace rebranded as  rackspace  the open cloud company   in       rackspace rebranded as  rackspace  the    managed cloud company      cloud files is a cloud hosting service that provides  unlimited online storage and cdn  for media  examples given include backups  video files  user content  on a utility computing basis   it was originally launched as mosso cloudfs on may         and is similar to amazon simple storage service   unlimited files of up to   gb can be uploaded  managed via the online control panel or restful api and optionally served out via akamai technologies  content delivery network      in addition to the online control panel  the service can be accessed over a restful api with open source client code available in c   net  python  php  java  and ruby  rackspace owned jungle disk allows cloud files to be mounted as a local drive within supported operating systems  linux  mac os x  and windows      redundancy is achieved by replicating three full copies of data across multiple computers in multiple  zones  within the same data center  where  zones  are physically  though not geographically  separate and supplied separate power and internet services  uploaded files can be distributed via akamai technologies to  hundreds of endpoints across the world  which provides an additional layer of data redundancy      the control panel and api are protected by ssl and the requests themselves are signed and can be safely delivered to untrusted clients  deleted data is zeroed out immediately        use cases considered as  well suited  include backing up or archiving data  serving images and videos  which are streamed directly to the users  browsers   serving content over content delivery networks  storing secondary static web accessible data  developing data storage applications  storing fluctuating and or unpredictable amounts of data and reducing costs  citation needed    there is no native operating system support for the cloud files api so it is not yet possible to  map  or  mount  it as a virtual drive without third party software like jungledisk that translates to a supported standard such as webdav  there are no concepts of  appending  or  locking  data within cloud files  which may affect some disk mirroring or backup solutions   nor support for permissions or transcoding  data is organised into  containers  but it is not possible to create nested folders without a translation layer        cloud servers is a cloud infrastructure service that allows users to deploy  one to hundreds of cloud servers instantly  and create  advanced  high availability architectures  similar to the amazon elastic compute cloud    the  cloud servers  are virtual machines running on the xen hypervisor for linux based instances  and citrix xenserver for windows and linux instances  each quad core hardware node has between    and    gb of ram  allowing for allocations between     mb and    gb  disk and cpu allocations scale up with memory  with disk sizes ranging from    gb to     gb    various distributions of linux are supported  including arch  centos  debian  fedora  gentoo  red hat enterprise linux and ubuntu     the technology behind the service was purchased in rackspace s october          acquisition of slicehost and the servers were formerly known as  slices   these are  much cheaper and generally easier to use than a traditional dedicated server   though it is still necessary to maintain the operating system and solution stack which is not required for the cloud sites product    this is one of the main differentiators between the two services  where cloud servers includes full root access and thus allows for more customisation  the cloud sites product is less flexible but requires less maintenance     on december           rackspace began offering a managed service level on the cloud servers product  which added additional support for the operating system and common applications as well as patching and other routine services    this additional support level does come at an increased cost  however     during       rackspace ceased to advertise the first generation cloud servers and the standard next generation cloud servers on its main cloud servers product page  opting to only disclose the next generation performance   and performance   products that require a minimum     month service charge per account for support service  the first generation and standard next generation platforms are now referred to as  legacy infrastructure  buried in the pricing page for the old products    the minimum charge for the lowest product on the first generation platform is        month for the    mb instance while the minimum charge on the standard next generation platform is        month for the    mb instance    on the performance platform  the minimum charge for one server is        for the  gb instance       minimum service charge  for a total of        month    rackspace is quietly phasing out its older  less expensive products in transition to a managed platform where mandatory support charges are incorporated into the cost of the services     cloud tools are applications and infrastructure software built to run on the rackspace cloud    applications listed include zend  a php stack  cloudkick  a cloud performance testing services  copperegg  a real time cloud server and application monitoring service  xeround  a mysql cloud database  and mongolab  the cloud version of the popular nosql database mongodb     the cloud servers api launched on july          under the creative commons attribution     license allows clients to create  configure and control virtual servers    in addition to issuing basic management commands this  enables elastic scenarios  whereby servers are instantiated and destroyed in response to fluctuating load  one of the key characteristics of cloud computing     rightscale is among third party providers to have announced support for this api       cloud sites is a platform as a service offering  similar to traditional web hosting only built on horizontally scalable hardware infrastructure  a fixed monthly credit card payment gives users access to the service with an allocation of compute  storage and bandwidth resources  should this allocation be exhausted then subsequent usage is billed on a utility computing basis  it allows an  unlimited  number of sites  databases and email accounts and includes reseller options such as client billing and support    touted as  the fastest way to put sites on the cloud   it runs windows or linux applications across  hundreds of servers        cloud sites supports the php    perl  python  mysql   net       asp and microsoft sql server      application frameworks       the service includes up to         compute cycles  per month which  is roughly equivalent to running a server with a     ghz modern processor for the same period of time   with additional cycles priced at usd        this non standard unit of measurement primarily reflects cpu processing time but also includes i o operations so pages with many database queries will consume more  compute cycles     it can however be difficult to compare services between providers without standard units of measurement     cloud sites does not support java  tomcat  coldfusion  ssh  rdp  api access  microsoft exchange or custom server side components at this time    it is also not possible to set up multiple top level domains to point to the same web root directory    the  net environment dropped support for  full trust  in favour of  modified medium trust  despite having previously announced on their blog that they had been able to work directly with microsoft to engineer a system that could accommodate full trust without compromising the security  scalability  and performance of other users         cloud servers and most other cloud products are physically located in any of six data centers    chicago  northern virginia  dallas  london  sydney  australia  or hong kong  a separate  uk  account is required to access the london based cloud products  however a single  us  rackspace cloud account can access all us data centers along with the sydney and hong kong regions  cloud sites are available in the dallas and chicago data centers only     the online control panel was custom built by and for the rackspace cloud service  as opposed to using control panel software like cpanel        the control panel includes management interfaces for the cloud sites  cloud servers and cloud files services  there was once a web based file manager  but this was removed for undisclosed reasons  it also allows users to manage multiple clients and the plans and products  e g  databases    x  support  that apply to them  with white label branding options for messaging  the clients themselves have access to a restricted version of the control panel that allows them to conduct administrative tasks such as managing mail accounts       the control panel is also home to the billing and reporting functions and provides access to support materials including developer resources  a knowledge base  forums and live chat       in       rackspace contributed the source code of its cloud files product to the openstack project under the apache license to become the openstack object storage component         in april       rackspace announced it would implement openstack compute as the underlying technology for their cloud servers product  the change will come a new control panel as well as add on cloud services offering databases  server monitoring  block storage  and virtual networking
