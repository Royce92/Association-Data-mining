 fixed capital is a concept in economics and accounting  first theoretically analyzed in some depth by the economist david ricardo  it refers to any kind of real or physical capital  fixed asset  that is not used up in the production of a product  it contrasts with circulating capital such as raw materials  operating expenses and the like     so fixed capital is that portion of the total capital outlay that is invested in fixed assets  such as land  buildings  vehicles  plant and equipment   that stay in the business almost permanently   or at the very least  for more than one accounting period  fixed assets can be purchased by a business  in which case the business owns them  they can also be leased  hired or rented  if that is cheaper or more convenient  or if owning the fixed asset is practically impossible  for legal or technical reasons      refining the classical distinction between fixed and circulating capital in das kapital  karl marx emphasizes that the distinction is really purely relative  i e  it refers only to the comparative rotation speeds  turnover time  of different types of physical capital assets  fixed capital also  circulates   except that the circulation time is much longer  because a fixed asset may be held for       or    years before it has yielded its value and is discarded for its salvage value  a fixed asset may also be resold and re used  which often happens with vehicles and planes     in national accounts  fixed capital is conventionally defined as the stock of tangible  durable fixed assets owned or used by resident enterprises for more than one year  this includes plant  machinery  vehicles   equipment  installations   physical infrastructures  the value of land improvements  and buildings     the european system of national and regional accounts  esa    explicitly includes produced intangible assets  e g  mineral exploitation  computer software  copyright protected entertainment  literary and artistics originals  within the definition of fixed assets     land itself is not included in the statistical concept of fixed capital  even although it is a fixed asset  the main reason is that land is not regarded as a product  a reproducible good   but the value of land improvements is included in the statistical concept of fixed capital  being regarded as the creation of value added through production             attempts have been made to estimate the value of the stock of fixed capital for the whole economy using direct enterprise surveys of  book value   administrative business records  tax assessments  and data on gross fixed capital formation  price inflation and depreciation schedules  a pioneer in this area was the economist simon kuznets      the so called  perpetual inventory method   pim  used to estimate fixed capital stocks was invented by raymond w  goldsmith in      and subsequently used around the world   the basic idea of the pim method is  that one starts off from a benchmark asset figure  and adds on the net additions to fixed assets year by year  using gross fixed capital formation data   while deducting annual depreciation  all data being adjusted for price inflation using a capital expenditure price index  in this way  one obtains a time series of annual fixed capital stocks  this data series can also be modified further with various other adjustments for prices  asset lifetimes etc   several variants of the pim approach are nowadays used by economic historians and statisticians      however  it is widely acknowledged that it is extremely difficult to obtain any accurate measurement of the value of fixed capital  especially because even the owner himself or herself may not know what the assets are currently  worth   what they are worth may become apparent only at the point where they are definitely sold for a price  some valuations for fixed assets may refer to historic cost  acquisition cost  or book value  others to current replacement cost  current sale value in the market  or scrap value     the depreciation write off permitted for tax purposes may also diverge from so called  economic depreciation  or  real  depreciation rates  economic depreciation rates are calculated on the basis of the observed average market prices that depreciated assets at different ages actually sell for  sometimes statisticians try to estimate the average  service lives  of fixed assets as a basis for calculating depreciation and scrap values  based on the observed length of time that fixed assets are actually held and used by their owners who own the business     almost always  the capital stock estimate which statisticians arrive at is a theoretical estimate based on a variety of data sources  and it does not correspond to the historical cost of fixed assets nor to actual depreciation write offs  however  it is believed to be a more accurate representation of the true value of the fixed capital stock     a business executive who invests in or accumulates fixed capital is tying up money in a fixed asset  hoping to make a future profit  thus  such an investment usually implies a risk  sometimes depreciation write offs are also viewed partly as a compensation for this risk  often leasing or renting a fixed asset  such as a vehicle  rather than buying it is preferred by enterprises because the cost of using it is lowered thereby  and the real owner may be able to obtain special tax advantages     an owner can obtain funding for purchase of fixed capital assets from the aptly named capital market  where loans are given on a long term basis  funding can also come from reserve funds  the selling of shares  and the issuing of debentures  bonds or other promissory notes
