 information engineering  ie  or information engineering methodology  iem  is a software engineering approach to designing and developing information systems  it can also be considered as the generation  distribution  analysis and use of information in systems             information engineering methodology involves an architectural approach to planning  analyzing  designing  and implementing applications  it aims to enable an enterprise to improve the management of its resources   including capital  people and information systems  to support the achievement of its business vision citation needed it is definedby whom  as   an integrated and evolutionary set of tasks and techniques that enhance business communication throughout an enterprise enabling it to develop people  procedures and systems to achieve its vision  citation needed it is also defined as the generation  distribution  analysis and use of information in systems citation needed this later definition involves the usage of machine learning  data mining and other computational methods to enhance the presentation and understanding of the high throughput data that is generated by different systems citation needed examples include bioinformatics  in which information engineering tackles the high throughput biological data for analysis and better biological understanding      information engineering has many purposes  including organization planning  business re engineering  application development  information systems planning and systems re engineering     information engineering has a somewhat chequered history that follows two very distinct threads  it originated in australia between      and       and appears first in the literature in a series of six indepth articles by the same name published by us computerworld in may   june        information engineering first provided data analysis and database design techniques that could be used by database administrators  dbas  and by systems analysts to develop database designs and systems based upon an understanding of the operational processing needs of organizations for the     s     clive finkelstein is acknowledged as the  father  of information engineering  ie     having developed its concepts from      to      based on original work carried out by him to bridge from strategic business planning to information systems  he wrote the first publication on information engineering  a series of six indepth articles by the same name published by us computerworld in may   june       he also co authored with james martin the influential savant institute report titled   information engineering   published in nov       the finkelstein thread evolved from      as the business driven variant of ie  the martin thread evolved into the data processing driven  dp  variant of ie  from      till      ie evolved further into a stronger business driven variant of ie  which was intended to address a rapidly changing business environment  the then technical director  charles m  richter  from      to       guided by clive finkelstein  played a significant role by revamping the ie methodology as well as helping to design the ie software product  user data  which helped automate the ie methodology  opening the way to next generation information architecture     the martin thread was database design driven from the outset and from      was focused on the possibility of automating the development process through the provision of techniques for business description that could be used to populate a data dictionary or encyclopedia that could in turn be used as source material for code generation  the martin methodology provided a foundation for the case  computer aided software engineering  tool industry  martin himself had significant stakes in at least four case tool vendors   intech  excelerator   higher order software  knowledgeware  originally database design inc   information engineering workbench  and james martin associates  originally dmw and now headstrong  the original designers of the texas instruments  information engineering facility and the principal developers of the methodology      at the end of the     s and early     s the martin thread incorporated rapid application development  rad  and business process reengineering  bpr  and soon after also entered the object oriented field  over this same period the finkelstein thread evolved further into enterprise architecture  ea  and his business driven ie methods evolved into enterprise engineering for the rapid delivery of ea  this is described in his books   enterprise architecture for integration  rapid delivery methods and technologies   first edition by clive finkelstein        in hardcover  the second edition        is in pdf and as an ibook on the apple ipad and ebook on the amazon kindle     there are two variants of information engineering  these are called the dp driven variant and the business driven variant     business driven ie is documented in the later books by clive finkelstein     dp driven variant of ie    business driven variant of ie for rapid delivery    some techniques that are used during an ie project are     there are several tools supporting information engineering    other tools include bachman s data analyst  excelerator  and more  see computer aided software
