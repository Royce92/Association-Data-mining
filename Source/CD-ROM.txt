 a cd rom   si  di  r m  is a pre pressed optical compact disc which contains data  the name is an acronym which stands for  compact disc read only memory   computers can read cd roms  but cannot write to cd roms which are not writable or erasable     until the mid     s  cd roms were popularly used to distribute software for computers and video game consoles  some cds  called enhanced cds  hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a cd player  while data  such as software or digital video  is only usable on a computer  such as iso      format pc cd roms      the yellow book is the technical standard that defines the format of cd roms  one of a set of color bound books that contain the technical specifications for all cd formats  the yellow book  created by sony and philips in       was the first extension of compact disc digital audio  it adapted the format to hold any form of data             cd roms are identical in appearance to audio cds  and data are stored and retrieved in a very similar manner  only differing from audio cds in the standards used to store the data   discs are made from a    xa mm thick disc of polycarbonate plastic  with a thin layer of aluminium to make a reflective surface  the most common size of cd rom is    xa mm in diameter  though the smaller mini cd standard with an   xa mm diameter  as well as numerous non standard sizes and shapes  e g   business card sized media  are also available citation needed    data are stored on the disc as a series of microscopic indentations  a laser is shone onto the reflective surface of the disc to read the pattern of pits and lands   pits   with the gaps between them referred to as  lands    because the depth of the pits is approximately one quarter to one sixth of the wavelength of the laser light used to read the disc  the reflected beam s phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam  causing destructive interference and reducing the reflected beam s intensity  this pattern of changing intensity of the reflected beam is converted into binary data     several formats are used for data stored on compact discs  known as the rainbow books  the yellow book  published in        defines the specifications for cd roms  standardized in      as the iso iec         ecma     standard  the cd rom standard builds on top of the original red book cd da standard for cd audio  other standards  such as the white book for video cds  further define formats based on the cd rom specifications  the yellow book itself is not freely available  but the standards with the corresponding content can be downloaded for free from iso  or ecma      there are several separate standards that define how to structure data files on a cd rom  iso      defines the standard file system for a cd rom  iso       is an improvement on this standard which adds support for non sequential write once and re writeable discs such as cd r and cd rw  as well as multiple sessions  the iso       standard was designed to address most of the shortcomings of iso        and a subset of it evolved into the udf format  which was adopted for dvds  the bootable cd specification  to make a cd emulate a hard disk or floppy disk  is called el torito     data stored on cd roms follows the standard cd data encoding techniques described in the red book specification  originally defined for audio cd only   this includes cross interleaved reed solomon coding  circ   eight to fourteen modulation  efm   and the use of pits and lands for coding the bits into the physical surface of the cd     the data structures used to group data on a cd rom are also derived from the red book  like audio cds  cd da   a cd rom sector contains       bytes of user data  composed of    frames  each consisting of    bytes     bytes for the user data    bytes for error correction  and   byte for the subcode   unlike audio cds  the data stored in these sectors corresponds to any type of digital data  not audio samples encoded according to the audio cd specification  in order to structure  address and protect this data  the cd rom standard further defines two sector modes  mode   and mode    which describe two different layouts for the data inside a sector  a track  a group of sectors  inside a cd rom only contains sectors in the same mode  but if multiple tracks are present in a cd rom  each track can have its sectors in a different mode from the rest of the tracks  they can also coexist with audio cd tracks as well  which is the case of mixed mode cds     both mode   and   sectors use the first    bytes for header information  but differ in the remaining       bytes due to the use of error correction bytes  unlike an audio cd  a cd rom cannot rely on error concealment by interpolation  a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required  to achieve improved error correction and detection  mode    used mostly for digital data  adds a    bit cyclic redundancy check  crc  code for error detection  and a third layer of reed solomon error correction  using a reed solomon product like code  rspc   mode   therefore contains     bytes per sector for error detection and correction  leaving       bytes per sector available for data  mode    which is more appropriate for image or video data  where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important   contains no additional error detection or correction bytes  having therefore       available data bytes per sector  note that both modes  like audio cds  still benefit from the lower layers of error correction at the frame level      before being stored on a disc with the techniques described above  each cd rom sector is scrambled to prevent some problematic patterns from showing up   these scrambled sectors then follow the same encoding process described in the red book in order to be finally stored on a cd     the following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in cd da and cd roms      the net byte rate of a mode   cd rom  based on comparison to cd da audio standards  is       xa hz      bits sample     channels                            xa kb s      xa kib s  this value      kib s  is defined as     speed   therefore  for mode   cd roms  a    cd rom drive reads            consecutive sectors per second     the playing time of a standard cd is    minutes  or       seconds  contained in         blocks or sectors  therefore  the net capacity of a mode   cd rom is    xa mb or  equivalently     xa mib  for    minute cds  the capacity is     mb      mib      cd rom xa is an extension of the yellow book standard for cd roms that combines compressed audio  video and computer data  allowing all to be accessed simultaneously   it was intended as a bridge between cd rom and cd i  green book  and was published by sony and philips in         xa  stands for extended architecture     cd rom xa defines two new sector layouts  called mode   form   and mode   form    which are different from the original mode     xa mode   form   is similar to the mode   structure described above  and can interleave with xa mode   form   sectors  it is used for data  xa mode   form   has       bytes of user data  and is similar to the standard mode   but with error detection bytes added  though no error correction   it can interleave with xa mode   form   sectors  and it is used for audio video data   video cds  super video cds  photo cds  enhanced music cds and cd i use these sector modes      the following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in cd rom xa modes     when a disc image of a cd rom is created  this can be done in either  raw  mode  extracting       bytes per sector  independent of the internal structure   or obtaining only the sector s useful data                          bytes depending on the cd rom mode   the file size of a disc image created in raw mode is always a multiple of       bytes  the size of a block    disc image formats that store raw cd rom sectors include ccd img  cue bin  and mds mdf  the size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using  for example  if a cd rom mode   image is created by extracting only each sector s data  its size will be a multiple of        this is usually the case for iso disc images     on a    minute cd r  it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode  up to                               bytes      xa mib   this is the upper limit for raw images created on a    min or     xa mib red book cd  the       increase is due to the discarding of error correction data     pre pressed cd roms are mass produced by a process of stamping where a glass master disc is created and used to make  stampers   which are in turn used to manufacture multiple copies of the final disc with the pits already present  recordable  cd r  and rewritable  cd rw  discs are manufactured by a different method  whereby the data are recorded on them by a laser changing the properties of a dye or phase transition material in a process that is often referred to as  burning      cd rom capacities are normally expressed with binary prefixes  subtracting the space used for error correction data  a standard    xa mm      mb cd rom can actually hold about    xa mb     xa mib  of data with error correction  or    xa mb total   in comparison  a single layer dvd rom can hold    xa gb of error protected data  more than   cd roms     cd rom discs are read using cd rom drives  a cd rom drive may be connected to the computer via an ide  ata   scsi  sata  firewire  or usb interface or a proprietary interface  such as the panasonic cd interface  virtually all modern cd rom drives can also play audio cds  as well as video cds and other data standards  when used in conjunction with the right software     cd rom drives employ a near infrared    xa nm laser diode  the laser beam is directed onto the disc via an opto electronic tracking module  which then detects whether the beam has been reflected or scattered     cd rom drives are rated with a speed factor relative to music cds  if a cd rom is read at the same rotational speed as an audio cd  the data transfer rate is    xa kib s  commonly referred to as       at this data rate  the track moves along under the laser spot at about    xa m s  to maintain this linear velocity as the optical head moves to different positions  the angular velocity is varied from     rpm at the inner edge to     rpm at the outer edge  the    speed rating for cd rom     xa kib s  is different from the    speed rating for dvds      xa mib s      by increasing the speed at which the disc is spun  data can be transferred at greater rates  for example  a cd rom drive that can read at    speed spins the disc at      to     xa rpm  giving a linear velocity of    xa m s and a transfer rate of     xa kib s  above     speed most drives read at constant angular velocity  cav  constant rpm  so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc  in cav mode the     number denotes the transfer rate at the outer edge of the disc  where it is a maximum      was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until samsung electronics introduced the scr       a   x cd rom drive which uses a ball bearing system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise  as of       the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about     or        rpm and     xa mib s  higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made  at      the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disk is around   xa m s  however  improvements can still be obtained by the use of multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the kenwood truex     which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately         faster     drives were common beginning in early       above     speed  there are problems with vibration and heat  cav drives give speeds up to     at the outer edge of the disc with the same rotational speed as a standard constant linear velocity  clv       or     with a slight increase  however due to the nature of cav  linear speed at the inner edge is still only      increasing smoothly in between  the actual throughput increase is less than        in fact  roughly     average for a completely full disc  and even less for a partially filled one     problems with vibration  owing to limits on achievable symmetry and strength in mass produced media  mean that cd rom drive speeds have not massively increased since the late     s  over    years later  commonly available drives vary between      slimline and portable units      spin speed  and      typically cd  and read only units      spin speed   all using cav to achieve their claimed  max  speeds  with     through     most common  even so  these speeds can cause poor reading  drive error correction having become very sophisticated in response  and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media  with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at              xa rpm  i e         cav   high rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration  rushing air and the spindle motor itself  most   st century drives allow forced low speed modes  by use of small utility programs  for the sake of safety  accurate reading or silence  and will automatically fall back if a large number of sequential read errors and retries are encountered     other methods of improving read speed were trialled such as using multiple optical beams  increasing throughput up to     with a     spin speed  but along with other technologies like       minute recordable media and  double density  recorders  their utility was nullified by the introduction of consumer dvd rom drives capable of consistent     cd rom speeds     dvd  or higher  additionally  with a    xa mb cd rom fully readable in under    minutes at     cav  increases in actual data transfer rate are decreasingly influential on overall effective drive speed when taken into consideration with other factors such as loading unloading  media recognition  spin up down and random seek times  making for much decreased returns on development investment  a similar stratification effect has since been seen in dvd development where maximum speed has stabilised at     cav  with exceptional cases between     and      and capacity at     and     gib  single and dual layer   with higher speed and capacity needs instead being catered to by blu ray drives     cd recordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings  one speed for write once operations  one for re write operations  and one for read only operations  the speeds are typically listed in that order  i e  a             cd drive can  cpu and media permitting  write to cd r discs at     speed      xa mib s   write to cd rw discs at     speed      xa mib s   and read from cds at     speed      xa mib s      software distributors  and in particular distributors of computer games  often make use of various copy protection schemes to prevent software running from any media besides the original cd roms  this differs somewhat from audio cd protection in that it is usually implemented in both the media and the software itself  the cd rom itself may contain  weak  sectors to make copying the disc more difficult  and additional data that may be difficult or impossible to copy to a cd r or disc image  but which the software checks for each time it is run to ensure an original disc and not an unauthorized copy is present in the computer s cd rom drive citation needed    manufacturers of cd writers  cd r or cd rw  are encouraged by the music industry to ensure that every drive they produce has a unique identifier  which will be encoded by the drive on every disc that it records  the rid or recorder identification code    this is a counterpart to the source identification code  sid   an eight character code beginning with  ifpi  that is usually stamped on discs produced by cd recording plants
