 a beam is a structural element that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending  the bending force induced into the material of the beam as a result of the external loads  own weight  span and external reactions to these loads is called a bending moment  beams are characterized by their profile  shape of cross section   their length  and their material     beams are traditionally descriptions of building or civil engineering structural elements  but smaller structures such as truck or automobile frames  machine frames  and other mechanical or structural systems contain beam structures that are designed and analyzed in a similar fashion             historically beams were squared timbers but are also metal  stone  or combinations of wood and metal  such as a flitch beam  beams generally carry vertical gravitational forces but can also be used to carry horizontal loads  e g   loads due to an earthquake or wind or in tension to resist rafter thrust as a tie beam or  usually  compression as a collar beam   the loads carried by a beam are transferred to columns  walls  or girders  which then transfer the force to adjacent structural compression members  in light frame construction joists may rest on beams     in carpentry a beam is called a plate as in a sill plate or wall plate  beam as in a summer beam or dragon beam     in engineering  beams are of several types      in the beam equation i is used to represent the second moment of area  it is commonly known as the moment of inertia  and is the sum  about the neutral axis  of da r^   where r is the distance from the neutral axis  and da is a small patch of area  therefore  it encompasses not just how much area the beam section has overall  but how far each bit of area is from the axis  squared  the greater i is  the stiffer the beam in bending  for a given material     internally  beams experience compressive  tensile and shear stresses as a result of the loads applied to them  typically  under gravity loads  the original length of the beam is slightly reduced to enclose a smaller radius arc at the top of the beam  resulting in compression  while the same original beam length at the bottom of the beam is slightly stretched to enclose a larger radius arc  and so is under tension  the same original length of the middle of the beam  generally halfway between the top and bottom  is the same as the radial arc of bending  and so it is under neither compression nor tension  and defines the neutral axis  dotted line in the beam figure   above the supports  the beam is exposed to shear stress  there are some reinforced concrete beams in which the concrete is entirely in compression with tensile forces taken by steel tendons  these beams are known as prestressed concrete beams  and are fabricated to produce a compression more than the expected tension under loading conditions  high strength steel tendons are stretched while the beam is cast over them  then  when the concrete has cured  the tendons are slowly released and the beam is immediately under eccentric axial loads  this eccentric loading creates an internal moment  and  in turn  increases the moment carrying capacity of the beam  they are commonly used on highway bridges     the primary tool for structural analysis of beams is the euler bernoulli beam equation  other mathematical methods for determining the deflection of beams include  method of virtual work  and the  slope deflection method   engineers are interested in determining deflections because the beam may be in direct contact with a brittle material such as glass  beam deflections are also minimized for aesthetic reasons  a visibly sagging beam  even if structurally safe  is unsightly and to be avoided  a stiffer beam  high modulus of elasticity and high second moment of area  produces less deflection     mathematical methods for determining the beam forces  internal forces of the beam and the forces that are imposed on the beam support  include the  moment distribution method   the force or flexibility method and the direct stiffness method     most beams in reinforced concrete buildings have rectangular cross sections  but a more efficient cross section for a beam is an i or h section which is typically seen in steel construction  because of the parallel axis theorem and the fact that most of the material is away from the neutral axis  the second moment of area of the beam increases  which in turn increases the stiffness     an i beam is only the most efficient shape in one direction of bending  up and down looking at the profile as an i  if the beam is bent side to side  it functions as an h where it is less efficient  the most efficient shape for both directions in  d is a box  a square shell  however the most efficient shape for bending in any direction is a cylindrical shell or tube  but  for unidirectional bending  the i or wide flange beam is superior citation needed    efficiency means that for the same cross sectional area  volume of beam per length  subjected to the same loading conditions  the beam deflects less     other shapes  like l  angles   c  channels  or tubes  are also used in construction when there are special requirements     a thin walled beam is a very useful type of beam  structure   the cross section of thin walled beams is made up from thin panels connected among themselves to create closed or open cross sections of a beam  structure   typical closed sections include round  square  and rectangular tubes  open sections include i beams  t beams  l beams  and so on  thin walled beams exist because their bending stiffness per unit cross sectional area is much higher than that for solid cross sections such a rod or bar  in this way  stiff beams can be achieved with minimum weight  thin walled beams are particularly useful when the material is a composite laminates  pioneer work on composite laminates thin walled beams was done by
