 wearable computers  also known as body borne computers or wearables are miniature electronic devices that are worn by the bearer under  with or on top of clothing   this class of wearable technology has been developed for general or special purpose information technologies and media development  wearable computers are especially useful for applications that require more complex computational support than just hardware coded logics     if one is asked to give a simple  yet modern  example for wearable technology  that will be the nike  system which allows you to track your time  distance  pace and calories via a sensor in the shoe  another example can be google glass  which combine innovative displays with some novel gestural movements for interaction     one of the main features of a wearable computer is consistency  there is a constant interaction between the computer and user  i e  there is no need to turn the device on or off  another feature is the ability to multi task  it is not necessary to stop what you are doing to use the device  it is augmented into all other actions  these devices can be incorporated by the user to act like a prosthetic  it can therefore be an extension of the user s mind and or body     many issues are common to the wearables as with mobile computing  ambient intelligence and ubiquitous computing research communities  including power management and heat dissipation  software architectures  wireless and personal area networks             in many applications  user s skin  hands  voice  eyes  arms as well as motion or attention are actively engaged as the physical environment     wearable computer items have been initially developed for and applied with e g     and other usage also     today still  wearable computing  is a topic of active research  with areas of study including user interface design  augmented reality  pattern recognition  the use of wearables for specific applications or for compensating disabilities as well as supporting elderly people steadily increases  the application of wearable computers into fashion design is evident through microsoft s prototype of  the printing dress  at the international symposium on wearable computers in june           due to the varied definitions of  wearable  and  computer   the first wearable computer could be as early as the first abacus on a necklace  a   th century abacus ring  the first wristwatch made by breguet for the queen of naples in       or the covert timing devices hidden in shoes to cheat at roulette by thorp and shannon in the     s and     s      a computer is not merely a time keeping or calculating device  but rather a user programmable item for complex algorithms  interfacing  and data management  by this definition  the wearable computer was invented by steve mann  in the late     s        steve mann  a professor at the university of toronto  was hailed as the father of the wearable computer and the isscc s first virtual panelist  by moderator woodward yang of harvard university  cambridge mass         ieee isscc   feb          the development of wearable items has taken several steps of miniaturization from discrete electronics over hybrid designs to fully integrated designs  where just one processor chip  a battery and some interface conditioning items make the whole unit     the qing dynasty saw the introduction of a fully functional abacus on a ring  which could be used while it was being worn       the first wearable timepiece was made by watchmaker breguet for the queen of naples in       it was a small ladies  pocket watch on a bracelet chain   again  a wristwatch is a  wearable computer  in the sense that it can be worn  and that it also computes time  but it is not a general purpose computer in the sense of the modern word     military use of wearables  in girard perregaux made wristwatches for the german imperial navy after an artillery officer complained that it was not convenient to use both hands to operate a pocket watch while timing his bombardments  the officer had strapped a pocket watch onto his wrist and his superiors liked his solution  and thus asked la chaux de fonds to travel to berlin to begin production of small pocket watches attached to wrist bracelets      early acceptance of wristlets by men serving in the military was not widespread  though     wristlets  as they were called  were reserved for women  and considered more of a passing fad than a serious timepiece  in fact  they were held in such disdain that many a gentlemen were actually quoted to say they  would sooner wear a skirt as wear a wristwatch            international watch magazine      in      mathematicians edward o  thorp  and claude shannon built some computerized timing devices to help them cheat at the game of roulette  one such timer was concealed in a shoe  another in a pack of cigarettes  various versions of this apparatus were built in the     s and     s  detailed pictures of a shoe based timing device can be viewed at www eyetap org     thorp refers to himself as the inventor of the first  wearable computer    in other variations  the system was a concealed cigarette pack sized analog computer designed to predict the motion of roulette wheels  a data taker would use microswitches hidden in his shoes to indicate the speed of the roulette wheel  and the computer would indicate an octant of the roulette wheel to bet on by sending musical tones via radio to a miniature speaker hidden in a collaborator s ear canal  the system was successfully tested in las vegas in june       but hardware issues with the speaker wires prevented it from being used beyond test runs    this was not a wearable computer  because it could not be repurposed during use  rather it was an example of task specific hardware  this work was kept secret until it was first mentioned in thorp s book beat the dealer  revised ed   in        and later published in detail in            the     s saw the rise of similar special purpose hardware timing devices  such as roulette prediction devices using next generation technology  in particular  a group known as eudaemonic enterprises used a cmos      microprocessor with  k ram to create a shoe computer with inductive radio communications between a data taker and bettor         another early wearable system was a camera to tactile vest for the blind  published by c c  collins in       that converted images into a      point     inch square tactile grid on a vest    on the consumer end       also saw the introduction of the hp    algebraic calculator watch by hewlett packard       the     s saw the rise of more general purpose wearable computers that fit the modern definition of  computer  by going beyond task specific hardware to more general purpose  e g  reprogrammable by the user  devices  in      steve mann designed and built a backpack mounted      based wearable multimedia computer with text  graphics  and multimedia capability  as well as video capability  cameras and other photographic systems   mann went on to be an early and active researcher in the wearables field  especially known for his      creation of the wearable wireless webcam  the first example of lifelogging         though perhaps not technically  wearable   in      steve roberts built winnebiko ii  a recumbent bicycle with on board computer and chorded keyboard  winnebiko ii was the first of steve roberts  forays into nomadic computing that allowed him to type while riding       in      reflection technology marketed the private eye head mounted display  which scanned a vertical array of leds across the visual field using a vibrating mirror  this display gave rise to several hobbyist and research wearables  including gerald  chip  maguire s ibm   columbia university student electronic notebook    doug platt s hip pc   and carnegie mellon university s vuman   in         the student electronic notebook consisted of the private eye  toshiba diskless aix notebook computers  prototypes  and a stylus based input system plus virtual keyboard  and used direct sequence spread spectrum radio links to provide all the usual tcp ip based services  including nfs mounted file systems and x    all running in the andrew project environment  the hip pc included an agenda palmtop used as a chording keyboard attached to the belt and a      megabyte floppy drive  later versions incorporated additional equipment from park engineering  the system debuted at  the lap and palmtop expo  on    april       vuman   was developed as part of a summer term course at carnegie mellon s engineering design research center  and was intended for viewing house blueprints  input was through a three button unit worn on the belt  and output was through reflection tech s private eye  the cpu was an  xa mhz       processor with     mb rom     in      the private eye was used in thad starner s wearable  based on doug platt s system and built from a kit from park enterprises  a private eye display on loan from devon sean mccullough  and the twiddler chording keyboard made by handykey  many iterations later this system became the mit  tin lizzy  wearable computer design  and starner went on to become one of the founders of mit s wearable computing project       also saw columbia university s augmented reality system known as karma  knowledge based augmented reality for maintenance assistance  users would wear a private eye display over one eye  giving an overlay effect when the real world was viewed with both eyes open  karma would overlay wireframe schematics and maintenance instructions on top of whatever was being repaired  for example  graphical wireframes on top of a laser printer would explain how to change the paper tray  the system used sensors attached to objects in the physical world to determine their locations  and the entire system ran tethered from a desktop computer         in      edgar matias and mike ruicci of the university of toronto  debuted a  wrist computer   their system presented an alternative approach to the emerging head up display plus chord keyboard wearable  the system was built from a modified hp   lx palmtop computer and a half qwerty one handed keyboard  with the keyboard and display modules strapped to the operator s forearms  text could be entered by bringing the wrists together and typing    the same technology was used by ibm researchers to create the half keyboard  belt computer    also in       mik lamming and mike flynn at xerox europarc demonstrated the forget me not  a wearable device that would record interactions with people and devices and store this information in a database for later query    it interacted via wireless transmitters in rooms and with equipment in the area to remember who was there  who was being talked to on the telephone  and what objects were in the room  allowing queries like  who came by my office while i was on the phone to mark   as with the toronto system  forget me not was not based on a head mounted display     also in       darpa started the smart modules program to develop a modular  humionic approach to wearable and carryable computers  with the goal of producing a variety of products including computers  radios  navigation systems and human computer interfaces that have both military and commercial use  in july      darpa went on to host the  wearables in       workshop  bringing together industrial  university and military visionaries to work on the common theme of delivering computing to the individual    a follow up conference was hosted by boeing in august       where plans were finalized to create a new academic conference on wearable computing  in october       carnegie mellon university  mit  and georgia tech co hosted the ieee international symposium on wearables computers  iswc  in cambridge  massachusetts  the symposium was a full academic conference with published proceedings and papers ranging from sensors and new hardware to new applications for wearable computers  with     people registered for the event     in       as part of kevin warwick s project cyborg  warwick s wife  irena  wore a necklace which was electronically linked to warwick s nervous system via an implanted electrode array  the color of the necklace changed between red and blue dependent on the signals on warwick s nervous system    dr  bruce h thomas and dr  wayne piekarski developed the tinmith wearable computer system to support augmented reality  this work was first published internationally in      in the iswc conference  the work was carried out at the wearable computer lab in the university of south australia     in the late     s  various chinese companies began producing mobile phones in the form of wristwatches  the descendants of which as of      include the i  and i   which are gsm phones with     inch displays  and the zgpax s  android wristwatch phone     the current moves in standardization with ieee  ietf and several industry groups  e g  bluetooth  leads to more various interfacing under the wpan  wireless personal area network  and the wban  wireless body area network  offer new classification of designs for interfacing and networking     also  the  th generation ipod nano has a wristwatch attachment available to convert it to a wearable wristwatch computer     the developments of wearable computing now encompasses rehabilitation engineering  ambulatory intervention treatment  life guard systems  defense wearable systems clarification needed    sony is now selling an android compatible wrist watch called sony smartwatch  it must be paired with an android phone as an additional  remote display and notification tool       google glass launched their optical head mounted display  ohmd  to a test group of users in       and plan on launching it to consumers sometime in       google s mission is to produce a mass market ubiquitous computer that displays information in a smartphone like hands free format    that can interact with the internet via natural language voice commands         in september       apple announced that the company is working on a smartwatch called apple watch  according to the new york times  apple has been testing both solar and wireless charging for the upcoming product       the commercialization of general purpose wearable computers  as led by companies such as xybernaut  cdi and via  inc  has thus far met with limited success  publicly traded xybernaut tried forging alliances with companies such as ibm and sony in order to make wearable computing widely available  but in      their stock was delisted and the company filed for chapter    bankruptcy protection amid financial scandal and federal investigation  xybernaut emerged from bankruptcy protection in january        via  inc  filed for bankruptcy in      and subsequently ceased operations       seiko marketed the ruputer  a computer in a  fairly large  wristwatch  to mediocre returns  in      ibm developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running linux  the last message about them dates to       saying the device would cost about      but it is still under development  in      fossil  inc  announced the fossil wrist pda  which ran the palm os  its release date was set for summer of       but was delayed several times and was finally made available on   january       timex datalink is another example of a practical wearable computer  hitachi launched a wearable computer called poma in       eurotech offers the zypad  a wrist wearable touch screen computer with gps  wi fi and bluetooth connectivity and which can run a number of custom applications    in       a wearable computing device on the wrist to control body temperature was developed at mit       evidence of weak market acceptance was demonstrated when panasonic computer solutions company s product failed  panasonic has specialized in mobile computing with their toughbook line for over    years and has extensive market research into the field of portable  wearable computing products  in       panasonic introduced a wearable brick computer coupled with a handheld or armworn touchscreen  the brick would communicate wirelessly to the screen  and concurrently the brick would communicate wirelessly out to the internet or other networks  the wearable brick was quietly pulled from the market in       while the screen evolved to a thin client touchscreen used with a handstrap   the  brick  computer is the cf    toughbook  dual batteries  screen used same batteries as the base      x     resolution  optional gps and wwan  has one m pci slot and one pcmcia slot for expansion  cpu used is a    xa mhz pentium   factory under clocked to    xa mhz so it can stay cool passively as it has no fan  micro dim ram is upgradable  the screen can be used wirelessly on other computers      google has announced that it has been working on a head mounted display based wearable  augmented reality  device called google glass  an early version of the device is currently available to the us public through google s explorer program         lg and iriver produce earbud wearables measuring heart rate and other biometrics  as well as various activity metrics         the wearable computer was introduced to the us army in      as a small computer that was meant to assist soldiers in battle  since then  the concept has grown to include the  land warrior program and proposal for future systems    the most extensive military program in the wearables arena is the us army s land warrior system    which will eventually be merged into the future force warrior system citation needed    f insas is an indian military project  designed largely with wearable computing
