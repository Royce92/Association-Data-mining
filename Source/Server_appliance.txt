 a server appliance is a computer appliance that works as a server  it is designed so that the end user does not need to understand the details of the operating system or the commands associated with it  server appliances have their hardware and software preconfigured by the manufacturer  the appliance is plugged into an existing network and is turned on by the end user  the user selects the components to be active  through a simple user interface  and the appliance then boots to an active state  which is usable within minutes  server appliances are designed to run and be controlled remotely after the initial set up  the units are designed to be very easy to operate and provide narrow selection of network services     examples of server appliances include the google search appliance  a search appliance designed for indexing corporate websites and returning these results   as well as the asa firewall  a security appliance designed to protect ip networks from unwanted inbound traffic   or ibm s lotus foundations which is designed to offer it infrastructure services for the small to midsize business             server appliances  unlike other computer appliances  provide server related services  such as  ftp  e mail  dns  vpn  firewall and print spooling services  they also operate as a web server or a nas or san storage server     a server appliance can be integrated into an existing network s infrastructure     server appliances are often used in situations where there is a lack of it staff resource  this can include sme and branch networks where there may be no resource at all and corporate networks where use of an appliance can allow less qualified staff to help manage the network     the initial network or configuration may be entered through touch pad push buttons on the front of the units   via a serial vga console or is set by dhcp     for further configuration and or maintenance these devices usually offer access to the server appliance through an internal web server  these web servers may listen on a special port and not on the normal port    for security reasons      the now unavailable cobalt networks raq series was previously purchased by isps who used them to sell hosting  ftp and or email services to clients  giving them remote administrative access directly to the machine      server appliances can also be utilized for non traditional it network functions  such as for remote product support  an early examplecitation needed developed by pratt   whitney in      in the aerospace industry is the onboard internet microserver  which extends an http network into a complex product at the subsystem level  such as an aircraft  using an embedded micro web server  it acts as the host and user interface between the subsystem s controller and both local and remote users  primarily for product support functions such as remotely collecting  processing  accessing and transferring of operational data  as well as onboard hosting of technical maintenance information for local operator access  they can also be used to facilitate two way communications between operators in the field and the factory through normal web server supported functions such as email  ftp  chat  or even voip and video  depending upon wireless communications speeds available  devices such as these  when deployed in a clustered network architecture  known as network centric product support  ncps   can create remote product support capabilities capable of being scaled to large fleets  where every product and its components become nodes in a supply chain supported network     some appliances especially storage appliances are based on common used but certified or recommended server hardware  usually hardware and software are sold together  example nexentastor zfs storage appliance   but there are also non commercial or free software alternatives to build a server appliance on recommended but regular hardware like nexentastor community edition or the napp it zfs appliance based on a free server operating systems like nexentacore  openindiana or other solaris based distributions
