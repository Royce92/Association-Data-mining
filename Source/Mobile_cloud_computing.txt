 mobile cloud computing  mcc  is the combination of cloud computing  mobile computing and wireless networks to bring rich computational resources to mobile users  network operators  as well as cloud computing providers    the ultimate goal of mcc is to enable execution of rich mobile applications on a plethora of mobile devices  with a rich user experience   mcc provides business opportunities for mobile network operators as well as cloud providers   more comprehensively  mcc can be defined as  a rich mobile computing technology that leverages uni ed elastic resources of varied clouds and network technologies toward unrestricted functionality  storage  and mobility to serve a multitude of mobile devices anywhere  anytime through the channel of ethernet or internet regardless of heterogeneous environments and platforms based on the pay as you use principle               mcc uses computational augmentation approachesclarification needed by which resource constraint mobile devices can utilize computational resources of varied cloud based resources   in mcc  there are four types of cloud based resources  namely distant immobile clouds  proximate immobile computing entities  proximate mobile computing entities  and hybrid  combination of the other three model    giant clouds such as amazon ec  are in the distant immobile groups whereas cloudlet or surrogates are member of proximate immobile computing entities  smartphones  tablets  handheld devices  and wearable computing devices are part of the third group of cloud based resources which is proximate mobile computing entities      vodafone   orange and verizon have started to offer cloud computing services for companies     in the mcc landscape  an amalgam of mobile computing  cloud computing  and communication networks  to augment smartphones  creates several complex challenges such as mobile computation offloading  seamless connectivity  long wan latency  mobility management  context processing  energy constraint  vendor data lock in  security and privacy  elasticity that hinder mcc success and adoption      although significant research and development in mcc is available in the literature  efforts in the following domains is still lacking       several academic and industrial research groups in mcc have been emerging since last few years  some of the mcc research groups in academia with large number of researchers and publications include
