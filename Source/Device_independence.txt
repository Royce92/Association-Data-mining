 device independence is the process of making a software application be able to function on a wide variety of devices regardless of the local hardware on which the software is used             in the early days of computer design and development up until about       software was typically specifically written to operate on the specific hardware where the software was used  the software was intimately linked to the hardware  and could not function independent of it  as computers became less expensive generalized personal computers  the concept of peripheral devices was introduced  where the base hardware could have a variety of different accessory devices from different manufacturers     at first  software which was to use this accessory hardware was required to be specifically designed to support it  in the time of ms dos  game programmers typically had to write custom control software for each type of sound card or video card that might be installed in the user s computer  the need to provide custom support for so many devices consumed a considerable amount of time for software development     eventually hardware abstraction layers  hal  such as directx were developed which separate application software from the underlying hardware  the application software does not need to know anything about the hardware on which it was to be used  instead it discovers the capabilities of the hardware through the standardized abstraction layer  and then use abstracted commands to control the hardware  it is up to the hal to be able to translate these commands into the specific format required for each device  using device drivers typically provided by the hardware manufacturer     as computing power has continued to increase  there is sufficient processing capacity available for entire hardware devices to be simulated in software  this has brought about the development of the hypervisor and device virtualization and emulation  allowing software written for one specific type of hardware to be reused on completely different hardware  or for seemingly independent operating systems to be made to share a single device     the web accessible by any device under any circumstance and by all people  the world wide web consortium  w c  has initiated the device independence working group  which aims to unify the web  making it accessible from many types of internet appliances  its mission is to avoid the breaking up of the web into spaces which only subsets of devices can access     one key publication of the device independence working group is the composite capability preference profiles recommendation     wurfl  the wireless universal resource file  is an open source product that addresses device detection and the ability to serve multiple user experiences to different classes of browsers and devices  based on the capabilities of the requesting http client
