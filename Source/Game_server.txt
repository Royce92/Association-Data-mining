 a game server  sometimes host or shared  is a server which is the authoritative source of events in a multiplayer video game  the server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its connected clients to maintain their own accurate version of the game world for display to players  they also receive and process each player s input             dedicated servers simulate game worlds without supporting direct input or output  except that required for their administration  players must connect to the server with separate client programs in order to see and interact with the game       the foremost advantage of dedicated servers is their suitability for hosting in professional data centers  with all of the reliability and performance benefits that entails  remote hosting also eliminates the low latency advantage that would otherwise be held by any player who hosts and connects to a server from the same machine or local network      dedicated servers cost money to run  however  cost are sometimes met by a game s developers  particularly on consoles  and sometimes by clan groups  but in either case  the public is reliant on third parties providing servers to connect to  for this reason  most games which use dedicated servers also provide listen server support      listen servers run in the same process as a game client  they otherwise function like dedicated servers  but typically have the disadvantage of having to communicate with remote players over the residential internet connection of the hosting player  residential connections rarely support the upload requirements of games with many players  the typical limit is     performance is also reduced by the simple fact that the machine running the server is also generating an output image  furthermore  listen servers grant anyone playing on them directly a large latency advantage over other players   host with most   and cease to exist when that player leaves the game       but listen servers have the advantage of being essentially free and not requiring any special infrastructure or forward planning to set up  which makes them common at lan parties where latency and bandwidth issues are not a concern  they are also common in console games     in the client server model outlined elsewhere in this article  clients receive processed data from the server and display it without much thought  in the alternative  peer to peer  model there is no server  each  peer  instead receives the raw input streams of each other player and determines the results itself      peer to peer is generally considered obsolete for action games  but it still common in the real time strategy genre due to its suitability for games with large numbers of tokens and small numbers of players  instead of constantly transmitting the positions of      troops  the game can make a one off transmission of the fact that      troops are selected and that the player in command of them just issued a move order      however  peer to peer has many disadvantages      the rate at which a game server runs simulation steps is commonly referred to as its  tickrate   a  tick  is a number associated with each simulation step which is broadcast to clients to help them synchronise with the server      there are three reasons to limit the frequency of server simulation steps to a predefined tickrate  to conserve server and client bandwidth  to conserve server cpu time  and to allow clients to be certain of how much time has elapsed between each tick  the last point is important for internet games  as network updates from the server can arrive at different intervals or even an incorrect order      servers  particularly those of pc games  can generally be customized in ways that still allow unaltered clients to connect to them  these customizations can include tweaks to built in game settings  content that is downloaded by clients when they join the game   and new code which changes the way that the server behaves      while server customization is popular with server administrators and players  it can be at odds with the desire of developers and other players for the game to be experienced as intended    it can also aggravate players by enabling abusive administrators to lie about what their server offers
