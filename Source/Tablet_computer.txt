 a tablet computer is a mobile computer with a touchscreen display  circuitry and battery in a single unit  tablets come equipped with sensors  including cameras  a microphone and an accelerometer  and the touchscreen display uses finger or stylus gestures substituting for the use of computer mouse and keyboard  they usually feature on screen  pop up virtual keyboards for typing  tablets may include physical buttons for basic features such as speaker volume and power  and ports for network communications and battery charging  tablets are typically larger than smartphones or personal digital assistants at   inches    xa cm  or larger  measured diagonally      tablets can be classified into several categories according to the presence and physical appearance of keyboards  slates and booklets do not have a physical keyboard and typically feature text input performed through the use of a virtual keyboard projected on a touchscreen enabled display  hybrids and convertibles do have physical keyboards  although these devices typically also make virtual keyboards available     conceptualized in the mid   th century  and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century  by      the first modern tablet  the ipad  was released  in march       pc magazine reported that     of u s  internet users owned a tablet  used mainly for viewing published content such as video and news   the top selling line of devices was apple s ipad with    xa million sold between its release in april      and mid october        but ipad market share in       number of units  was down to     with android tablets selling to      android tablet sales volume was     million devices  plus    million  in      and      respectively   individual brands of android operating system devices or compatibles follow ipad with amazon s kindle fire with  xa million  and barnes   noble s nook with  xa million       as of february           of mobile app developers were targeting tablets    however     of developers were targeting smartphones  as of       tablets are large product category in spite of the original skepticism by many consumers  analysts and journalists  even those who had hopes for the future of tablets could not have predicted tablets  rapid rise in popularity and ubiquity       the tablet computer and its associated operating system began with the development of pen computing    electrical devices with data input and output on a flat information display existed as early as      with the telautograph    which used a sheet of paper as display and a pen attached to electromechanical actuators  throughout the   th century devices with these characteristics have been imagined and created whether as blueprints  prototypes  or commercial products  in addition to many academic and research systems  several companies released commercial products in the     s  with various input output types tried out     tablet computers appeared in a number of works of science fiction in the second half of the   th century  with the depiction of arthur c  clarke s newspad    in stanley kubrick s      film       a space odyssey  the description of calculator pad in the      novel foundation by isaac asimov  the opton in the      novel return from the stars by stanislaw lem  the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy in douglas adams s      comedy of the same name  and the numerous devices depicted in gene roddenberry      star trek series  all helping to promote and disseminate the concept to a wider audience    a device more powerful than today s tablets appeared briefly in jerry pournelle and larry niven s      the mote in god s eye       in       computer scientist alan kay envisioned a kiddicomp  while a phd candidate     he developed and described the concept as a dynabook in his      proposal  a personal computer for children of all ages    the paper outlines the requirements for a conceptual portable educational device that would offer functionality similar to that supplied via a laptop computer or  in some of its other incarnations  a tablet or slate computer with the exception of the requirement for any dynabook device offering near eternal battery life  adults could also use a dynabook  but the target audience was children     the sci fi tv series star trek the next generation featured tablet computers which were designated as  padds        in       the european union initiated the  omi newspad  project  ep       inspired by clarke and kubrick s fictional work    acorn computers developed and delivered an arm based touch screen tablet computer for this program  branded the newspad  the barcelona based trial ended in            during the november      comdex  microsoft used the term tablet pc to describe a prototype handheld device they were demonstrating           in       ericsson mobile communications announced an experimental product named the delphipad which was developed in cooperation with the centre for wireless communications in singapore  with touch sensitive screen  netscape navigator as web browser and linux as its operating system         following their earlier tablet computer products such as the pencept penpad     and the cic handwriter    in september       grid systems release the first commercially available tablet type portable computer  the gridpad    all three products were based on extended versions of the ms dos operating system     in       at t released their first eo personal communicator  this was one of the first commercially available tablets and ran the go corporation s penpoint os on at t s own hardware  including their own at t hobbit cpu     in       atari showed the stylus  later renamed to st pad prototype to developers  this one was based on the tos gem atari st platform and included already an early handwriting recognition  shiraz shivji s company momentus demonstrated in the same time a failed x   ms dos based pen computer with its own gui       apple computers launched the apple newton personal digital assistant in       it utilised apple s own new newton os  initially running on hardware manufactured by motorola and incorporating an arm cpu  that apple had specifically co developed with acorn computers  the operating system and platform design were later licensed to sharp and digital ocean  who went on to manufacture their own variants     in       palm  inc  released the first of the palm os based palmpilot touch and stylus based pda  the touch based devices initially incorporating a motorola dragonball         cpu     intel announced a strongarm   processor based touchscreen tablet computer in       under the name webpad  it was later re branded as the  intel web tablet        in       norwegian company screen media as and the german company dosch   amand gmbh released the   freepad     it was based on linux and used the opera browser  the internet access was provided by dect dmap  only available in europe and provided up to   mbit s wireless access  the device had    mb storage     mb of ram and x   compatible    xa mhz  geode  microcontroller by national semiconductor    the screen was       or       and was touch sensitive  it had slots for sim cards to enable support of television set up box  freepad were sold in norway and the middle east  but the company was dissolved in          in april       microsoft launched the pocket pc       utilising their touch capable windows ce     operating system    the devices were manufactured by several manufacturers  based on a mix of  x    mips  arm  and superh hardware     in       microsoft attempted to define the microsoft tablet pc   as a mobile computer for field work in business    though their devices failed  mainly due to pricing and usability decisions that limited them to their original purpose   such as the existing devices being too heavy to be held with one hand for extended periods  and having legacy applications created for desktop interfaces and not well adapted to the slate format       nokia had plans for an internet tablet since before       an early model was test manufactured in       the nokia m     which was running on epoc and featuring an opera browser  speakers and a    inch         screen  but it was not released because of fears that the market was not ready for it    in       nokia finally released the first of its internet tablet range  the nokia      these tablets now ran a debian based linux os called maemo  nokia used the term internet tablet to refer to a portable information appliance that focused on internet use and media consumption  in the range between a personal digital assistant  pda  and an ultra mobile pc  umpc   they made two mobile phones  the n    that runs maemo  and n  that run meego       android was the first of today s dominating platforms for tablet computers to reach the market  in       the first plans for android based tablets appeared  the first products were released in       among them was the archos    a pocket sized model with a   inch touchscreen  that was first released with a proprietary operating system and later  in       released with android      the camangi webstation was released in q        the first lte android tablet appeared late      and was made by icd for verizon  this unit was called the ultra  but a version called vega was released around the same time  ultra had a   inch display while vega s was    inches  many more products followed in       several manufacturers waited for android honeycomb  specifically adapted for use with tablets  which debuted in february          apple is often credited for defining a new class of consumer device with the ipad    which shaped the commercial market for tablets in the following years    and was the most successful tablet at the time of its release  ipads and competing devices have been tested by the us military    its debut in      pushed tablets into the mainstream      samsung s galaxy tab and others followed  continuing the trends towards the features listed above     in       samsung announced a tablet running android and windows   operating systems concurrently  switching from one operating system to the other and vice versa does not require restarting the device  and data can be synchronized between the two operating systems    the device  named ativ q  was scheduled for release in late      but its release has been indefinitely delayed    meanwhile  asus released its transformer book trio  a tablet that is also capable of running the operating systems windows   and android       by      around     of b b companies were said to have deployed tablets for sales related activities  according to a survey report by corporate visions       a key component among tablet computers is touch input  this allows the user to navigate easily and type with a virtual keyboard on the screen  the first tablet to do this was the gridpad by grid systems corporation  the tablet featured both a stylus  a pen like tool to aid with precision in a touchscreen device as well as an on screen keyboard       the system must respond to touches rather than clicks of a keyboard or mouse  which allows integrated hand eye operation  a natural use of the somatosensory system        this is even more true of the more recent multi touch interface  which often emulate the way objects behave     all version of the windows os since vista have natively supported advanced handwriting recognition  including via a digital stylus    windows xp supported handwriting with optional downloads from ms  the windows handwriting recognition routines constantly analyze the user s handwriting to improve performance  handwriting recognition is also supported in many applications such as microsoft onenote  and windows journal  some arm powered tablets  such as the galaxy note     also support a stylus and support handwriting recognition  wacom and n trig digital pens provide approximately      dpi resolution for handwriting    exceeding the resolution of capacitive touch screens by more than a factor of     these pens also support pressure sensitivity  allowing for  variable width stroke based  characters  such as chinese japanese korean writing  due to their built in capability of  pressure sensing   pressure is also used in digital art applications such as autodesk sketchbook         touchscreens are usually one of two forms     some tablets can recognize individual palms  while some professional grade tablets use pressure sensitive films  such as those on graphics tablets  some capacitive touch screens can detect the size of the touched area and the pressure used       today s tablets use capacitive touchscreens with multi touch  unlike earlier stylus driven resistive touchscreen devices  after      with the access to capacitive screens and the success of the iphone  multi touch and other natural user interface features  as well as flash memory solid state storage and  instant on  warm booting  external usb and bluetooth keyboards defined tablets  some have  g mobile telephony applications     most tablets released since mid      use a version of an arm processor for longer battery life  the arm cortex family is powerful enough for tasks such as internet browsing  light production work and mobile games       as with smartphones  most mobile tablet apps are supplied through online distribution  rather than boxed software or direct sales from software vendors  these sources  known as  app stores   provide centralized catalogues of software and allow  one click  on device software purchasing  installation and updates  the app store is often shared with smartphones that use the same operating system       special hardware  the tablets can be equipped with special hardware to provide functionality  such as camera  gps and local data storage     besides a touchscreen and keyboard  some tablets can also use these input methods     there are number of tablets  which can be loosely separated in several categories  by physical size and input output technology     tablets without dedicated keyboards were the first tablets which gained commercial success  and they contributed highly to the general public tablet image     slates are single piece devices without any rotating or slide out parts     a slate s size may vary  starting from   inches  approximately   xa cm     some models in the larger than    inch category include the samsung galaxy tab pro      at      inches  the toshiba excite at      inches   and the dell xps    at      inches    as of march       the thinnest tablet on the market was the sony xperia tablet z at only      inches     xa mm  thick    in october       hp announced the hp slate    all in one  hybrid  with       ips display complete with keyboard and mouse  it runs on android  but has no internal battery       mini tablets are smaller and lighter than standard slates  with a typical screen size between   and   in  the first successful ones were introduced by samsung  galaxy tab   inch   barnes   noble  the nook tablet   blackberry playbook  and amazon  the kindle fire  in       and by google  the nexus    in       most of them work like the larger tablets     in october       apple released the ipad mini  its size is     inches  about   inches smaller than the regular size ipad  but was less powerful than the then current ipad      in november       apple released the ipad mini    it remains at     inches and it nearly matches the hardware of the ipad air     amazon released an upgraded version of the kindle fire  called the kindle fire hd  on september           with higher resolution and more features compared than the original kindle fire  and it remains   inches    amazon further updated the fire tablet with the kindle fire hdx in september          google released an upgraded version of the nexus   on july           with fhd display  dual cameras  stereo speakers  more color accuracy  performance improvement  built in wireless charging  and a variant with  g lte support for at t  t mobile  and verizon     since       crossover touch screen mobile phones with screens greater than   inches have been released  that size is generally considered larger than a traditional smartphone  creating a hybrid category called a phablet by forbes and engadget  phablet is a portmanteau of phone and tablet    examples of phablets are the lg optimus vu  samsung galaxy note and dell streak  samsung announced they had shipped a million units of the galaxy note within two months of introducing it         booklets are dual touchscreen tablet computers with a clamshell design that folds like a laptop  examples include the sony tablet p  which was considered a flop     the toshiba libretto w    and the aborted microsoft courier  booklets were discontinued in            tablets with dedicated keyboards form the boundary between slate tablets and laptop computers     hybrids are tablets with a dedicated detachable keyboard  in some cases sold separately     hybrid tablets have a standard tablet base with a detachable keyboard that resembles a laptop keyboard  they are usually sold together as parts of the same product  unlike slates  whose keyboards are an optional accessory     laplet is a portmanteau of the words laptop and tablet  it is a cross of these device types    being in general a hybrid  it is different from other hybrids in the following ways  laplets are to run an x   architecture cpu  typically low  or ultra low voltage model   such as intel core i   run a full featured os like windows      and have a number of typical laptop i o ports  such as usb and mini displayport  laplets are to be used not only as media consumption devices  but also as desktop or laptop replacements  laplets are designed to run desktop applications  such as adobe photoshop  and to connect peripheral devices  such as mouse  or keyboard  or a number of external displays    microsoft s surface pro series devices exemplify laplets         convertible tablets have a slate tablet top half with a keyboard bottom half  they more closely resemble laptops  usually considered more as laptops than tablets  and are heavier and larger than slates  while some convertibles  such as the asus transformer series  run android  the release of windows   increased the prominence of this form factor among the laptop market  typically  the base of a convertible attaches to the display at a single joint called a swivel hinge or rotating hinge  the joint allows the screen to rotate through      and lie against the back of the keyboard to provide a flat writing surface  this design  although the most common  creates a physical point of weakness  the panasonic toughbook     for example  is advertised as a more durable convertible notebook  the hp elitebook     p convertible notebook uses a reinforced hinge that protrudes slightly from the rear of the unit  and the acer travelmate c     has a sliding design in which the screen slides up from the slate like position and locks into place to provide the laptop mode  the first tablet to have a sliding screen was the samsung sliding pc  series    a tablet with intel atom processor and a sliding screen that allows it to be used as a laptop or slate tablet when the screen is locked in place covering the whole keyboard  it is intended to combine the virtues of tablet pcs with those of notebooks  the inspiron duo from dell rotates the screen horizontally when opened     some tablets are also modified by adding physical gamepad buttoms for better gaming experience combined with the touchscreen  most of these tablets are targeted to run native os games and emulator games     two major architectures dominate the tablet market    arm holdings  arm architecture and intel s and amd s x       intel s x    including x      has powered the  ibm compatible  pc since      and apple s macintosh computers since       the cpus have been incorporated into tablet pcs over the years and generally offer greater performance along with the ability to run full versions of microsoft windows  along with windows desktop and enterprise applications  non windows based x   tablets include the joojoo  intel announced plans to enter the tablet market with its atom in           in october       intel s foundry operation announced plans to build fpga based quad cores for arm and x   processors      arm has been the cpu architecture of choice for manufacturers of smartphones      arm   pdas  digital cameras      arm   set top boxes  dsl routers  smart televisions      arm   storage devices and tablet computers      arm    third party source needed this dominance began with the release of the mobile focused and comparatively power efficient    bit arm    processor originally designed for the apple newton and acorn a  in       the chip was adopted by psion  palm and nokia for pdas and later smartphones  camera phones  cameras  etc  arm s licensing model supported this success by allowing device manufacturers to licence  alter and fabricate custom soc derivatives tailored to their own products  this has helped manufacturers extend battery life and shrink component count along with the size of devices     the multiple licensees ensured that multiple fabricators could supply near identical products  while encouraging price competition  this forced unit prices down to a fraction of their x   equivalents  the architecture has historically had limited support from microsoft  with only windows ce available  but with the      release of windows    microsoft announced additional support for the architecture  shipping their own arm based tablet computer  branded the microsoft surface  as well as an x      intel core i  variant branded as microsoft surface pro             intel tablet chip sales were   million units in       and    million units in         intel chairman andy bryant has stated that its      goal is to quadruple its tablet chip sales to    million units by the end of that year    as an investment for            tablets  like conventional pcs  run multiple operating systems  though dual booting on tablets is relatively rare   these operating systems come in two classes  desktop based and mobile based   phone like   os  desktop os based tablets are currently thicker and heavier  require more storage  more cooling and give less battery life  but can run processor intensive applications such as adobe photoshop in addition to mobile apps and have more ports    while mobile based tablets are the reverse  only run mobile apps  those that focus more so on mobile apps use battery life conservatively because the processor is significantly smaller  this allows the battery to last much longer than the common laptop       at the end of q        globalwebindex noted that in two years tablet usage increased by     percent  with     million android tablet users and     million ipad users making up    percent       by year end       gartner found that     million  plus   m in       android tablets     million  plus   m in       ios tablets  and   million  plus  m in       windows tablets had been sold to end users       and      results        android is a linux based operating system that google offers as open source under the apache license  it is designed primarily for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers  android supports low cost arm systems and others  many such systems were announced in            vendors such as motorola   and lenovo   delayed deployment of their tablets until after       when android was reworked to include more tablet features     android      honeycomb  and later versions support larger screen sizes  mainly tablets  and have access to the google play service  android includes operating system  middleware and key applications     other vendors sell customized android tablets such as nook and kindle fire  which are used to consume mobile content and provide their own app store  rather than using the larger google play system  thereby fragmenting the android market        google introduced the nexus   and nexus    tablets in       hardware makers that have shipped android tablets include acer  asus  samsung  toshiba and sony        the ipad runs ios  which was created for the iphone and ipod touch  although built on the same underlying unix implementation as macos  its user interface is radically different  ios is designed for fingers and has none of the features that required a stylus on earlier tablets  apple introduced multi touch gestures  such as moving two fingers apart or together to zoom in or out  also known as  pinch to zoom      ios is built for the arm architecture        previous to the ipad  axiotron introduced    an aftermarket  heavily modified apple macbook called modbook  a mac os x based tablet personal computer  the modbook uses apple s inkwell for handwriting and gesture recognition  and uses digitization hardware from wacom  to get mac os x to talk to the digitizer on the integrated tablet  the modbook is supplied with a third party driver called tabletmagic  wacom does not provide driver support for this device  another predecessor to the ipad was the apple messagepad introduced in          following windows for pen computing for windows     in       microsoft supported tablets running windows xp under the microsoft tablet pc name     according to microsoft    in        microsoft tablet pcs  are pen based  fully functional x   pcs with handwriting and voice recognition functionality  tablet pcs used the same hardware as laptops but added support for pen input  windows xp tablet pc edition provided pen support  tablet support was added to both home and business versions of windows vista and windows    tablets running windows could use the touchscreen for mouse input  hand writing recognition and gesture support  following tablet pc  microsoft announced the ultra mobile pc initiative in      which brought windows tablets to a smaller  touch centric form factor        in       microsoft showed a prototype of a two screen tablet called microsoft courier  but cancelled the project  a model of the asus eee pad shown in      was to use windows ce but switched to android        in october       microsoft released windows    which features significant changes to various aspects of the operating system s user interface and platform which are designed for touch based devices such as tablets  the operating system also introduced an application store and a new style of application optimized primarily for use on tablets        microsoft also introduced windows rt  an edition of windows   for use on arm based devices     the launch of windows   and rt was accompanied by the release of devices with the two operating systems by various manufacturers  including microsoft themselves  with the release of surface   such as slate tablets  hybrids  and convertibles     windows rt is likely to be discontinued     in the first half of       windows tablets have grown            on june           microsoft launched the microsoft surface tablet  initially named surface rt upon release   the first computer    in the company s history  surface runs windows rt and comes with a tegra   soc  one kickstand position  usb     port  microsd card slot to expand storage and one megapixel cameras  front and back   it has been succeeded by surface   in       which was not restocked in the microsoft online store as of january                 on february         the surface pro have been launched  a laptop replacement in a tablet form factor  two successors have been released since the release of the original device  surface pro   and surface pro    while maintaining a slightly bigger weight and size to surface and surface    the surface pro series devices run a full featured windows     pro os and include a low power intel core i  i  i  cpu  usb     and mini displayport  capable of connect of up to three external displays     firefox os is an open source operating system based on linux and the firefox web browser  targeting low end smartphones  tablet computers and smart tv devices  in       the mozilla foundation started a prototype tablet model with foxconn        the progear by frontpath was an early implementation of a linux tablet that used a transmeta chip and a resistive digitizer  the progear initially came with a version of slackware linux  and later with windows     they can run many operating systems  however  the device is no longer for sale and frontpath has ceased operations  many touch screen sub notebook computers can run any of several linux distributions with little customization     x org now supports screen rotation and tablet input through wacom drivers  and handwriting recognition software from both the qt based qtopia and gtk  based internet tablet os provide open source systems  kde s plasma active is a graphical environment for tablet        linux open source note taking software includes xournal  which supports pdf file annotation   gournal  a gnome based note taking application   and the java based jarnal  which supports handwriting recognition as a built in function   a standalone handwriting recognition program  cellwriter  requires users to write letters separately in a grid     many desktop distributions include tablet friendly interfaces smaller devices  these open source libraries are freely available and can be run or ported to devices that conform to the tablet pc design  maemo  rebranded meego in        a debian linux based user environment  was developed for the nokia internet tablet devices       n     n      n      it is currently in generation    and has many applications  ubuntu uses the unity ui  and many other distributions  such as fedora  use the gnome shell  which also supports ubuntu      canonical has hinted that ubuntu will be available on tablets by          however  by january      there was no commercial release of a ubuntu tablet        tabletkiosk was the first to offer a hybrid digitizer   touch device running opensuse linux     nokia entered the tablet space in may      with the nokia     running maemo  a debian based linux distribution custom made for their internet tablet line  the product line continued with the n     with phone capabilities  the user interface and application framework layer  named hildon  was an early instance of a software platform for generic computing in a tablet device intended for internet consumption     but nokia didn t commit to it as their only platform for their future mobile devices and the project competed against other in house platforms and later replaced it with the series           following the launch of the ultra mobile pc  intel started the mobile internet device initiative  which took the same hardware and combined it with a tabletized linux configuration  intel co developed the lightweight moblin  mobile linux  operating system following the successful launch of the atom cpu series on netbooks     meego was a linux based operating system developed by intel and nokia that supports netbooks  smartphones and tablet pcs  in       nokia and intel combined the maemo and moblin projects to form meego  the first tablet using meego is the neofonie wetab launched september      in germany  the wetab uses an extended version of the meego operating system called wetab os  wetab os adds runtimes for android and adobe air and provides a proprietary user interface optimized for the wetab device  on september          the linux foundation announced that meego would be replaced in      by tizen        several hardware companies have build hybrid devices with the possibility to work with both the windows   and android operating systems        in mid       asus released a hybrid touchscreen windows tablet laptop with a detachable android smartphone  when docked to the back of the tablet laptop display  the android phone is displayed within the windows   screen  which is switchable to android tablet and android laptop        the blackberry playbook is a tablet computer announced in september      that runs the blackberry tablet os     the os is based on the qnx system that research in motion acquired in early       delivery to developers and enterprise customers was expected in october       the blackberry playbook was officially released to us and canadian consumers on april           as of       playbook is not available on sale on any blackberry websites  the os though continues on its smartphones     hewlett packard announced that the touchpad  running webos     on a    xa ghz snapdragon cpu  would be released in june       on august           hp announced the discontinuation of the touchpad  due to sluggish sales     in february       hp announced they had sold webos to lg electronics        mobile device suppliers typically adopt a walled garden approach  wherein the supplier controls what applications are available  software development kits are restricted to approved developers  this can be used to reduce the impact of malware  provide material with an approved content rating  control application quality and exclude competing vendors        apple  google  amazon  microsoft and barnes   noble all adopted the strategy  the latter originally allowed arbitrary apps to be installed           but  in december       excluded third parties                 apple and ibm have agreed to cooperate in cross selling ibm developed applications for ipads and iphones in enterprise level accounts        proponents of open source software say that it violates the spirit of personal control that traditional personal computers have always provided              as of october       display screen shipments for tablets began surpassing shipments for laptop display screens        according to a survey conducted by the online publishers association  opa  in march           percent of internet
