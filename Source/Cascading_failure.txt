 a cascading failure is a failure in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of a part can trigger the failure of successive parts  such a failure may happen in many types of systems  including power transmission  computer networking  finance  human bodily systems  and bridges     cascading failures usually begin when one part of the system fails  when this happens  nearby nodes must then take up the slack for the failed component  this in turn overloads these nodes  causing them to fail as well  prompting additional nodes to fail one after another in a vicious circle             cascading failure is common in power grids when one of the elements fails  completely or partially  and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system  those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements  cascading failure is a common effect seen in high voltage systems  where a single point of failure  spf  on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system  this surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure  setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time     this failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load  for example  under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer     monitoring the operation of a system  in real time  and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade  another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures  to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure  and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures citation needed    one of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload  i e  since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed  it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element  to ameliorate this systemic defect  superconducting magnetic energy storage units at critical junctions can store or release power for a few seconds to allow control systems to catch up and actuate isolating procedures     cascading failure caused the following power outages     cascading failures can also occur in computer networks  such as the internet  in which network traffic is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network  caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software  in this context  the cascading failure is known by the term cascade failure  a cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems     the cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single  crucial router or node  which causes the node to go down  even briefly  it can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades  in either case  traffic is routed to or through another  alternative  path  this alternative path  as a result  becomes overloaded  causing it to go down  and so on  it will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation     the symptoms of a cascade failure are easy to see  packet loss and high network latency  not just to single systems  but to whole sections of a network or the internet  the high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to congestion collapse  which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them  as a result  routes can still be considered valid  without them actually providing communication     if enough routes go down because of a cascade failure  a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable  although undesired  this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out  and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section s  that have become cut off  decreasing load on the involved nodes     a common occurrence during a cascade failure is a walking failure  where sections go down  causing the next section to fail  after which the first section comes back up  this ripple can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored     cascade failures are a relatively recent development  with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks  the term was first applied in this context in the late     s by a dutch it professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large scale failure citation needed    network failures typically start when a single network node fails  initially  the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped  systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts  usually  the redundant systems of an isp respond very quickly  choosing another path through a different backbone  the routing path through this alternative route is longer  with more hops and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered     this can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down  creating similar problems of their own     also  related systems are affected in this case  as an example  dns resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected  might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down  this  in turn  may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems  that can cause another cascade failure all on its own     in december       a partial loss       of gmail service occurred globally  for    minutes  this loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic in this case  the error was caused by logic using an inappropriate all instead of the more appropriate some  the cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time     certain load bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the  zipper effect   where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members  in the case of the hyatt regency walkway collapse  a suspended walkway  which was already overstressed due to an error in construction  failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed  overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially  i e  like a zipper   a bridge that can have such a failure is called fracture critical  and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part  properly designed structures use an adequate factor of safety and or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure      biochemical cascades exist in biology  where a small reaction can have system wide implications  one negative example is ischemic cascade  in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill off far more cells than the initial damage  resulting in more toxins being released  current research is to find a way to block this cascade in stroke patients to minimize the damage     in the study of extinction  sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen  such a species is known as a keystone species     another example is the cockcroft walton generator  which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed diode can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second     yet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the implosion in      of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the super kamiokande experiment  where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction     in finance  the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as systemic risk  the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions  its counterparties  to fail  cascading throughout the system  institutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either  too big to fail   tbtf  or  too interconnected to fail   tictf   depending on why they appear to pose a threat     note however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se  but due to the interconnections     today s networks are becoming increasingly dependent on one another  diverse infrastructures such as water supply  transportation  fuel and power stations are coupled together  owing to this coupling  interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failure  and in particular to targeted attacks  such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes from one network can produce an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks   electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks  and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years  blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks  for example  the september          blackout in italy resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network  health care systems  and financial services and  in addition  severely influenced communication networks  the partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the power grid management system  thus producing a negative feedback on the power grid   this example emphasizes how inter dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system  a framework to study the cascading failures between coupled networks based on percolation theory was developed recently   cascading failures in spatially embedded systems have been shown to lead to extreme vulnerability
