 edge computing is pushing the frontier of computing applications  data  and services away from centralized nodes to the logical extremes of a network  it enables analytics and knowledge generation to occur at the source of the data  this approach requires leveraging resources that may not be continuously connected to a network such as laptops  smartphones  tablets and sensors  edge computing covers a wide range of technologies including wireless sensor networks  mobile data acquisition  mobile signature analysis  cooperative distributed peer to peer ad hoc networking and processing also classifiable as local cloud fog computing and grid mesh computing  distributed data storage and retrieval  autonomic self healing networks  virtual cloudlets  remote cloud services  augmented reality  and more              as mentioned before  edge computing pushes applications  data and computing power  services  away from centralized points to the logical extremes of a network  edge computing replicates fragments of information across distributed networks of web servers  which may be vast and include many networks  as a topological paradigm  edge computing is also referred to as mesh computing  peer to peer computing  autonomic  self healing  computing  grid computing  and other names implying non centralized  node less availability     to ensure acceptable performance of widely dispersed distributed services  large organizations typically implement edge computing by deploying web server farms with clustering  previously available only to very large corporate and government organizations  technology advancement and cost reduction for large scale implementations have made the technology available to small and medium sized business     the target end user is any internet client making use of commercial internet application services     edge computing imposes certain limitations on the choices of technology platforms  applications or services  all of which need to be specifically developed or configured for edge computing     edge computing has many advantages     edge computing and grid computing are related  whereas grid computing would be hard coded into a specific application to distribute its complex and resource intensive computational needs across a global grid of cheap networked machines  edge computing provides a generic template facility for any type of application to spread its execution across a dedicated grid of prepared expensive machines
