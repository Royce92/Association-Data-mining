 desktop virtualization is software technology that separates the desktop environment and associated application software from the physical client device that is used to access it     desktop virtualization can be used in conjunction with application virtualization and  windows  user profile management systems  now termed  user virtualization   to provide a comprehensive desktop environment management system  in this mode  all the components of the desktop are virtualized  which allows for a highly flexible and much more secure desktop delivery model  in addition  this approach supports a more complete desktop disaster recovery strategy as all components are essentially saved in the data center and backed up through traditional redundant maintenance systems  if a user s device or hardware is lost  the restore is much more straightforward and simple  because basically all the components will be present at login from another device  in addition  because no data is saved to the user s device  if that device is lost  there is much less chance that any critical data can be retrieved and compromised  below are more detailed descriptions of the types of desktop virtualization technologies that will be used in a typical deployment             desktop virtualization implementations are classified based on whether the virtual desktop runs remotely or locally  on whether the access is required to be constant or is designed to be intermittent  and on whether or not the virtual desktop persists between sessions  typically  software products that deliver desktop virtualization solutions can combine local and remote implementations into a single product to provide the most appropriate support specific to requirements  the degree of independent functionality of the client device is necessarily interdependent with the server location and access strategy  and virtualization is not strictly required for remote control to exist  virtualization is employed to present independent instances to multiple users  and requires a strategic segmentation of the host server and presentation at some layer of the host s architecture  the enabling layer usually application software is called a hypervisor   summarizing from       remote desktop virtualization implementations operate as a client server computing environment  application execution takes place on a remote operating system which is linked to the local client device over a network using a remote display protocol through which the user interacts with applications  all applications and data used remain on the remote system with only display  keyboard  and mouse information communicated with the local client device  which may be a conventional pc laptop  a thin client device  a tablet  or even a smartphone  a common implementation of this approach is to host multiple desktop operating system instances on a server hardware platform running a hypervisor  this is generally referred to as  virtual desktop infrastructure  or  vdi   it should be noted that vdi is often used incorrectly to refer to any desktop virtualization implementation      remote desktop virtualization is frequently used in the following scenarios     it is also used as a means of providing access to windows applications on non windows endpoints including tablets  smart phones and non windows based desktop pcs and laptops     remote desktop virtualization is also used as a means of resource sharing  to provide low cost desktop computing services in environments where providing every user with a dedicated desktop pc is either too expensive or otherwise unnecessary     a virtual desktop infrastructure  vdi  is a desktop orientated service that hosts user desktop environments on remote servers and or blade pcs  users accessed the desktops over a network using a remote display protocol  a connection brokering service connects users to their assigned desktop sessions  for users  this means they can access their desktop from any location  without having to use a single client device  since the resources are centralized  users moving between work locations can still access the same desktop environment with their applications and data   for it administrators  this means a more centralized  efficient client environment that is easier to maintain and able to respond more quickly to the changing needs of the user and business       remote desktop services  also called terminal services  server based computing  and presentation virtualization  is a component of microsoft windows that allows a user to access applications and data on a remote computer over a network using a remote display protocol  another leading example of presentation virtualization is citrix xenapp  remote desktop services is functionally similar to vdi in that it hosts the users  desktop environments on remote servers  however it differs from vdi in two important ways     the use of a single shared server operating system instead of individual desktop operating system instances consumes significantly fewer resources than the same number vdi sessions  at the same time vdi licensing is both more expensive and less flexible than equivalent remote desktop services licenses  together these factors can combine to make remote desktop services based remote desktop virtualization more attractive than vdi      remote desktop services is generally understood to refer to the microsoft windows component  however an open source remote desktop protocol server   named  xrdp    is under development      however  vdi implementations allow for delivering a personalized workspace back to a user  which retains all the user s customizations  there are several methods to accomplish this  one is to deliver fully persistent vm desktops  in which a user gets a dedicated desktop that functions essentially as their own pc  another mode is to deliver non persistent desktops which do not include user personalization  these are vm desktops delivered from a pool which are then used for a session and returned to the pool  this approach has the advantage of keeping vm desktops  clean  as nothing is saved to the image by the user  non persistent desktops can be paired with user virtualization technologies to deliver user profiles and customizations  and all profiles settings  application data settings  configuration and user data   to the user upon login  the user profile is matched with a non persistent desktop providing an experience that is very little different from a pc  all changes made to the user profile are saved to the profile and are restored to the user upon their next login  however  the vm is returned to the pool with no changes saved to it     application virtualization improves delivery and compatibility of applications by encapsulating them from the underlying operating system on which they are executed  a fully virtualized application is not installed on hardware  in the traditional sense  instead  a hypervisor layer intercepts the application which at runtime acts as if it is interfacing with the original operating system and all the resources managed by it  when in reality it is not  examples of enterprise application virtualization software include citrix xenapp  microsoft app v  vmware thinapp and systancia applidis  liquidware labs offers a slightly different approach to application virtualization with its flexapp feature in its profileunity solution  flexapp does not virtualize the application  instead it virtualizes the location of the application     user virtualization separates all of the software aspects that define a user s personality on a device from the operating system and applications to be managed independently and applied to a desktop as needed without the need for scripting  group policies  or use of roaming profiles  the term  user virtualization  sounds misleading  this technology is not limited to virtual desktops  user virtualization can be used regardless of platform   physical  virtual  cloud  etc  the major desktop virtualization platform vendors  citrix  microsoft and vmware  all offer a form of basic user virtualization in their platforms     desktop layering is a method of desktop virtualization that divides a disk image into logical parts to be managed individually  for example  if all members of a user group use the same os  then the core os only needs to be backed up once for the entire environment who share this layer  layering can be applied to local physical disk images  client based virtual machines  or host based desktops  windows operating systems are not designed for layering  therefore each vendor must engineer their own proprietary solution     remote desktop virtualization can also be provided via a cloud computing similar to that provided using a software as a service model  this approach is usually referred to as cloud hosted virtual desktops  cloud hosted virtual desktops are divided into two technologies  managed vdi  which is based on vdi technology provided as an outsourced managed service and desktop as a service  daas  which provides a higher level of automation and real multi tenancy reducing the cost of the technology  the daas provider typically takes full responsibility for hosting and maintaining the compute  storage  and access infrastructure  as well as applications and application software licenses needed to provide the desktop service in return for a fixed monthly fee  for example  vmware s horizon daas  based on vmware s acquisition of desktone  is a monthly fixed rate daas service   amazon s workspaces on amazon ec  is also a monthly fixed rate      cloud hosted virtual desktops can be implemented using both vdi and remote desktop services based systems and can be provided through public cloud  private cloud infrastructure  and hybrid cloud platforms  private cloud implementations are commonly referred to as  managed vdi   public cloud offerings tend to be based on desktop as a service technology citation needed    the us company desktone has the trademarks on the expressions  desktops as a service  and  daas  from the u s  patent and trademark office       local desktop virtualization implementations run the desktop environment on the client device using hardware virtualization or emulation  for hardware virtualization  depending on the implementation both type i and type ii hypervisors may be used       local desktop virtualization is well suited for environments where continuous network connectivity cannot be assumed and where application resource requirements can be better met by using local system resources  however  local desktop virtualization implementations do not always allow applications developed for one system architecture to run on another  for example  while it is possible to use local desktop virtualization to run windows   on top of os x on an intel based apple mac  using a hypervisor such as virtualbox  parallels desktop for mac  or vmware fusion  as both use the same x   architecture  and as it was possible to run windows on a powerpc based mac using virtual pc  it is currently not possible to run windows   on an arm based tablet  as there are no emulators that run on those tablets and emulate an x   based pc citation needed
