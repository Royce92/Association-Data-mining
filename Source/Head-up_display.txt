 a head up display or heads up display  also known as a hud is any transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints  the origin of the name stems from a pilot being able to view information with the head positioned  up  and looking forward  instead of angled down looking at lower instruments     although they were initially developed for military aviation  huds are now used in commercial aircraft  automobiles and other  mostly professional applications             a typical hud contains three primary components  a projector unit  a combiner  and a video generation computer      the projection unit in a typical hud is an optical collimator setup  a convex lens or concave mirror with a cathode ray tube  light emitting diode  or liquid crystal display at its focus  this setup  a design that has been around since the invention of the reflector sight in       produces an image where the light is parallel i e  perceived to be at infinity     the combiner is typically an angled flat piece of glass  a beam splitter  located directly in front of the viewer  that redirects the projected image from projector in such a way as to see the field of view and the projected infinity image at the same time  combiners may have special coatings that reflect the monochromatic light projected onto it from the projector unit while allowing all other wavelengths of light to pass through  in some optical layouts combiners may also have a curved surface to refocus the image from the projector     the computer provides the interface between the hud  i e  the projection unit  and the systems data to be displayed and generates the imagery and symbology to be displayed by the projection unit      other than fixed mounted huds  there are also head mounted displays  hmds   including helmet mounted displays  both abbreviated hmd   forms of hud that features a display element that moves with the orientation of the user s head     many modern fighters  such as the f a     f    and eurofighter  use both a hud and hmd concurrently  the f    lightningxa ii was designed without a hud  relying solely on the hmd  making it the first modern military fighter not to have a fixed hud     huds are split into four generations reflecting the technology used to generate the images     newer micro display imaging technologies are being introduced  including liquid crystal display  lcd   liquid crystal on silicon  lcos   digital micro mirrors  dmd   and organic light emitting diode  oled      huds evolved from the reflector sight  a pre world war ii parallax free optical sight technology for military fighter aircraft   the gyro gunsight added a reticle that moved based on the speed and turn rate to solve the amount of lead needed to hit a target while maneuvering     during the early     s  the telecommunications research establishment  tre   in charge of uk radar development  found that royal air force  raf  night fighter pilots were having a hard time reacting to the verbal instruction of the radar operator as they approached their targets  they experimented with the addition of a second radar display for the pilot  but found they had trouble looking up from the lit screen into the dark sky in order to find the target  in october      they had successfully combined the image from the radar tube with a projection from their standard ggs mk  ii gyro gunsight on a flat area of the windscreen   a key upgrade was the move from the original ai mk  iv radar to the microwave frequency ai mk  vii radar found on the de havilland mosquito night fighter  this set produced an artificial horizon that further eased head up flying      in      the us navy s office of naval research and development did some research with a mockup hud concept unit along with a sidestick controller in an attempt to ease the pilot s burden flying modern jet aircraft and make the instrumentation less complicated during flight  while their research was never incorporated in any aircraft of that time  the crude hud mockup they built had all the features of today s modern hud units      hud technology was next advanced by the royal navy in the buccaneer  the prototype of which first flew on    april       the aircraft s design called for an attack sight that would provide navigation and weapon release information for the low level attack mode  there was fierce competition between supporters of the new hud design and supporters of the old electro mechanical gunsight  with the hud being described as a radical  even foolhardy option  the air arm branch of the ministry of defence sponsored the development of a strike sight  the royal aircraft establishment  rae  designed the equipment  it was built by cintel  and the system was first integrated in       the cintel hud business was taken over by elliott flight automation and the buccaneer hud was manufactured and further developed  continuing up to a markxa iii version with a total of     systems made  it was given a  fit and forget  title by the royal navy and it was still in service nearly    years later  bae systems thus has a claim to the world s first head up display in operational service      in the united kingdom  it was soon noted that pilots flying with the new gun sights were becoming better at piloting their aircraft citation needed at this point  the hud expanded its purpose beyond weapon aiming to general piloting  in the     s  french test pilot gilbert klopfstein created the first modern hud and a standardized system of hud symbols so that pilots would only have to learn one system and could more easily transition between aircraft  the modern hud used in instrument flight rules approaches to landing was developed in        klopfstein pioneered hud technology in military fighter jets and helicopters  aiming to centralize critical flight data within the pilot s field of vision  this approach sought to increase the pilot s scan efficiency and reduce  task saturation  and information overload     use of huds then expanded beyond military aircraft  in the     s  the hud was introduced to commercial aviation  and in       the oldsmobile cutlass supreme became the first production car with a head up display     until a few years ago  the embraer      saab       boeing      boeing                   and boeing     new generation aircraft                   and     series  were the only commercial passenger aircraft available with huds  however  the technology is becoming more common with aircraft such as the canadair rj  airbus a    and several business jets featuring the displays  huds have become standard equipment on the boeingxa       furthermore  the airbus a     a     a    and a    families are currently undergoing the certification process for a hud    huds are also added to the space shuttle orbiter     there are several factors that interplay in the design of a hud     on aircraft avionics systems  huds typically operate from dual independent redundant computer systems  they receive input directly from the sensors  pitot static  gyroscopic  navigation  etc   aboard the aircraft and perform their own computations rather than receiving previously computed data from the flight computers  on other aircraft  the boeing      for example  the hud guidance computation for low visibility take off  lvto  and low visibility approach comes from the same flight guidance computer that drives the autopilot  computers are integrated with the aircraft s systems and allow connectivity onto several different data buses such as the arinc      arinc      and mil std           typical aircraft huds display airspeed  altitude  a horizon line  heading  turn bank and slip skid indicators  these instruments are the minimum required by    cfr part          other symbols and data are also available in some huds     since being introduced on huds  both the fpv and acceleration symbols are becoming standard on head down displays  hdd   the actual form of the fpv symbol on an hdd is not standardized but is usually a simple aircraft drawing  such as a circle with two short angled lines            degrees  and  wings  on the ends of the descending line  keeping the fpv on the horizon allows the pilot to fly level turns in various angles of bank     in addition to the generic information described above  military applications include weapons system and sensor data such as     during the     s  the military tested the use of huds in vertical take off and landings  vtol  and short take off and landing  stol  aircraft  a hud format was developed at nasa ames research center to provide pilots of v stol aircraft with complete flight guidance and control information for category iii c terminal area flight operations  this includes a large variety of flight operations  from stol flights on land based runways to vtol operations on aircraft carriers  the principal features of this display format are the integration of the flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view  easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance  and the superposition of vertical and horizontal situation information  the display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft       the use of head up displays allows commercial aircraft substantial flexibility in their operations  systems have been approved which allow reduced visibility takeoffs  and landings  as well as full category iii a landings and roll outs        studies have shown that the use of a hud during landings decreases the lateral deviation from centerline in all landing conditions  although the touchdown point along the centerline is not changed       in more advanced systems  such as the faa labeled enhanced flight vision system    a real world visual image can be overlaid onto the combiner  typically an infrared camera  either single or multi band  is installed in the nose of the aircraft to display a conformed image to the pilot  evs enhanced vision system is an industry accepted term which the faa decided not to use because  the faa believes it could be confused with the system definition and operational concept found in        l  and  m     in one evs installation  the camera is actually installed at the top of the vertical stabilizer rather than  as close as practical to the pilots eye position   when used with a hud however  the camera must be mounted as close as possible to the pilots eye point as the image is expected to  overlay  the real world as the pilot looks through the combiner      registration   or the accurate overlay of the evs image with the real world image  is one feature closely examined by authorities prior to approval of a hud based evs  this is because of the importance of the hud matching the real world     while the evs display can greatly help  the faa has only relaxed operating regulations   so an aircraft with evs can perform a category i approach to category ii minimums  in all other cases the flight crew must comply with all  unaided  visual restrictions   for example if the runway visibility is restricted because of fog  even though evs may provide a clear visual image it is not appropriate  or actually legal  to maneuver the aircraft using only the evs below      agl      hud systems are also being designed to display a synthetic vision system  svs  graphic image  which uses high precision navigation  attitude  altitude and terrain databases to create realistic and intuitive views of the outside world           in the svs head down image shown on the right  immediately visible indicators include the airspeed tape on the left  altitude tape on the right  and turn bank slip skid displays at the top center  the boresight symbol   v   is in the center and directly below that is the flight path vector symbol  the circle with short wings and a vertical stabilizer   the horizon line is visible running across the display with a break at the center  and directly to the left are numbers at     degrees with a short line at    degrees  the    degree line is easier to see  which  along with the horizon line  show the pitch of the aircraft  unlike this color depiction of svs on a head down primary flight display  the svs displayed on a hud is monochrome   that is  typically  in shades of green     the image indicates a wings level aircraft  i e  the flight path vector symbol is flat relative to the horizon line and there is zero roll on the turn bank indicator   airspeed is     knots  altitude is      feet  heading is     degrees  the number below the turn bank indicator   close inspection of the image shows a small purple circle which is displaced from the flight path vector slightly to the lower right  this is the guidance cue coming from the flight guidance system  when stabilized on the approach  this purple symbol should be centered within the fpv     the terrain is entirely computer generated from a high resolution terrain database     in some systems  the svs will calculate the aircraft s current flight path  or possible flight path  based on an aircraft performance model  the aircraft s current energy  and surrounding terrain  and then turn any obstructions red to alert the flight crew  such a system might have helped the pilots of american airlines flight     prevent the fatal accident in      citation needed    on the left side of the display is an svs unique symbol  with the appearance of a purple  dimishing sideways ladder  and which continues on the right of the display  the two lines define a  tunnel in the sky   this symbol defines the desired trajectory of the aircraft in three dimensions  for example  if the pilot had selected an airport to the left  then this symbol would curve off to the left and down  if the pilot keeps the flight path vector alongside the trajectory symbol  the craft will fly the optimum path  this path would be based on information stored in the flight management system s data base and would show the faa approved approach for that airport     the tunnel in the sky can also greatly assist the pilot when more precise four dimensional flying is required  such as the decreased vertical or horizontal clearance requirements of rnp  under such conditions the pilot is given a graphical depiction of where the aircraft should be and where it should be going rather than the pilot having to mentally integrate altitude  airspeed  heading  energy and longitude and latitude to correctly fly the aircraft       these displays are becoming increasingly available in production cars  and usually offer speedometer  tachometer  and navigation system displays  night vision information is also displayed via hud on certain automobiles    in      pioneer corporation introduced a navigation system that projects a hud in place of the driver s visor that presents animations of conditions ahead  a form of augmented reality  ar       add on hud systems also exist  projecting the display onto a glass combiner mounted on the windshield     motorcycle helmet huds are also commercially available       huds have been proposed or are being experimentally developed for a number of other applications  in the military  a hud can be used to overlay tactical information such as the output of a laser rangefinder or squadmate locations to infantrymen  a prototype hud has also been developed that displays information on the inside of a swimmer s goggles or of a scuba diver s mask    a group of electrical engineering students from the university of massachusetts amherst are integrating technologies in order to develop an affordable personal head up display    one such design is a hud in skiing goggles  hud systems that project information directly onto the wearer s retina with a low powered laser  virtual retinal display  are also in experimentation
