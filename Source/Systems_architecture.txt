 a system architecture or systems architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure  behavior  and more views of a system   an architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system  organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system     a system architecture can comprise system components  the externally visible properties of those components  the relationships  e g  the behavior  between them  it can provide a plan from which products can be procured  and systems developed  that will work together to implement the overall system  there have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture  collectively these are called architecture description languages  adls                various organizations define systems architecture in different ways  including     one can think of system architecture as a set of representations of an existing  or future  system  it conveys the informational content of the elements comprising a system  the relationships among those elements  and the rules governing those relationships  the architectural components and set of relationships between these components that an architecture description may consist of hardware  software  documentation  facilities  manual procedures  or roles played by organizations or people clarification needed    a system architecture primarily concentrates on the internal interfaces among the system s components or subsystems  and on the interface s  between the system and its external environment  especially the user   in the specific case of computer systems  this latter  special  interface is known as the computer human interface  aka human computer interface  or chi  formerly called the man machine interface      one can contrast a system architecture with system architecture engineering  sae    the method and discipline for effectively implementing the architecture of a system       it is important to keep in mind that the modern systems architecture did not appear out of nowhere  systems architecture depends heavily on practices and techniques which were developed over thousands of years in many other fields  perhaps the most important being civil architecture     prior to the advent of digital computers  the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the term  system  as it is still commonly used today  however  with the arrival of digital computers and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline  it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts  software artifacts  and the combined artifacts  a programmable hardware artifact  or computing machine  that lacks its software program is impotent  even as a software artifact  or program  is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable  hardware  machine  however  a hardware machine and its software program can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks  within the computer and software engineering disciplines  and  often  other engineering disciplines  such as communications   then  the term system came to be defined as containing all of the elements necessary  which generally includes both hardware and software  to perform a useful function     consequently  within these engineering disciplines  a system generally refers to a programmable hardware machine and its included program  and a systems engineer is defined as one concerned with the complete device  both hardware and software and  more particularly  all of the interfaces of the device  including that between hardware and software  and especially between the complete device and its user  the chi   the hardware engineer deals  more or less  exclusively with the hardware device  the software engineer deals  more or less  exclusively with the software program  and the systems engineer is responsible for seeing that the software program is capable of properly running within the hardware device  and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment  especially the user  and performing its intended function     by analogy  then  a systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and hardware and is used to enable design of such a composite system  a good architecture may be viewed as a  partitioning scheme   or algorithm  which partitions all of the system s present and foreseeable requirements into a workable set of cleanly bounded subsystems with nothing left over  that is  it is a partitioning scheme which is exclusive  inclusive  and exhaustive  a major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the sub systems so that there is a minimum of interdependencies needed among them  in both software and hardware  a good sub system tends to be seen to be a meaningful  object   moreover  a good architecture provides for an easy mapping to the user s requirements and the validation tests of the user s requirements  ideally  a mapping also exists from every least element to every requirement and test     several types of systems architectures  underlain by the same fundamental principles    have been identified as follows
