 an application server can be either a software framework that provides a generalized approach to creating an application server implementation  regard to what the application functions are   or the server portion of a specific implementation instance  in either case  the server s function is dedicated to the efficient execution of procedures  programs  routines  scripts  for supporting its applied applications     most application server frameworks contain a comprehensive service layer model  an application server acts as a set of components accessible to the software developer through an api defined by the platform itself  for web applications  these components are usually performed in the same running environment as its web server s   and their main job is to support the construction of dynamic pages  however  many application servers target much more than just web page generation  they implement services like clustering  fail over  and load balancing  so developers can focus on implementing the business logic      in the case of java application servers  the server behaves like an extended virtual machine for running applications  transparently handling connections to the database on one side  and  often  connections to the web client on the other citation needed    other uses of the term may refer to the services that a server makes available or the computer hardware on which the services run citation needed            the term was originally used when discussing early client server systems to differentiate servers that contain application logic sql services  and middleware servers as distinct from other types of data servers     in the late     s  because of the ubiquity of the web browser as an application deployment strategy  there is a mistaken belief that the term refers to a web application environment  however  web applications are within the scope of application server technologies clarification needed    java platform  enterprise edition or java ee  was j ee  defines the core set of api and features of java application servers     the web modules include servlets  and javaserver pages  enterprise javabeans are used to manage transactions  according to the j ee blueprints the business logic of an application resides in enterprise javabeans   a modular server component providing many features  including declarative transaction management  and improving application scalability     some java application servers leave off many java ee features like ejb and jms including tomcat from apache  and jetty from eclipse foundation  their focus is more on java servlets and javaserver pages     there are many open source java application servers that support java ee including jonas from object web  jboss as from jboss  division of red hat   geronimo from apache  tomee from apache  resin java application server from caucho technology  blazix from desiderata software  enhydra server from enhydra org  and glassfish from oracle     commercial java application servers have been dominated by weblogic application server by oracle  websphere application server from ibm and the open source jboss enterprise application platform  jboss eap  by red hat     a java server page  jsp  executes in a web container  jsps provide a way to create html pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page  html coders and java programmers can work side by side by referencing each other s code from within their own     the application servers mentioned above mainly serve web applications  and services via rmi  ejb  jms and soap  some application servers target networks other than web based ones  session initiation protocol servers  for instance  target telephony networks citation needed    microsoft positions their middle tier applications and services infrastructure in the windows server operating system and the  net framework technologies in the role of an application server   the windows application server role includes internet information services  iis  to provide web server support  the  net framework to provide application support  asp net to provide server side scripting  com  for application component communication  message queing for multithreaded processing  and the windows communication foundation  wcf  for application communication      php application servers are used for running and managing php applications     zend server  built by zend technologies  provides application server functionality for the php based applications     appserver io  built by techdivision gmbh is a multithreaded application server for php written in php     open source application servers also come from other vendors  such as appaserver     non java offerings have no formal interoperability specifications on par with the java specification request  as a result  interoperability between non java products is poor compared to that of java ee based products     a mobile app server is mobile middleware that makes back end systems accessible to mobile applications to support mobile application development  much like a web server that stores  processes and delivers web pages to clients  a mobile app server bridges the gap from existing infrastructure to mobile devices     although most standards based infrastructure  including soas   are designed to connect to any independent of any vendor  product or technology  most enterprises have trouble connecting back end systems to mobile applications  because mobile devices add the following technological challenges      the purpose of a mobile application server is to build on existing infrastructure to accommodate mobile devices     core capabilities of a mobile application services include    mobile application servers  application servers  and web servers serve similar purposes  they are a piece of middleware that connects back end systems to the users that need to access them  but the technology in each of the three differs  application servers   developed before the ubiquity of web based applications   expose back end business logic through various protocols  sometimes including http  and manage security  transaction processing  resource pooling  and messaging   when web based applications grew in popularity  application servers did not meet the needs of developers  and the web server was created to fill the gap citation needed    web servers provide the caching and scaling functionality demanded by web access and not provided by application servers  they convert requests to static content  and serve only http content    over time  application servers and web servers have morphed from two previously distinct categories  blended features  and arguably have merged citation needed    mobile application servers are on a similar path citation needed the emergence of mobile devices presents the need for functionality not anticipated by the developers of traditional application server developers  and mobile application servers fill this gap  they take care of the security  data management and off line requirements not met by existing infrastructure  and present content exclusively in rest     over time  these three categories may fully merge and be available in a single product  but the root functions differ     a mobile application server can be deployedxa
