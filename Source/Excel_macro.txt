 microsoft excel is a spreadsheet application developed by microsoft for microsoft windows  mac os  and ios  it features calculation  graphing tools  pivot tables  and a macro programming language called visual basic for applications  it has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms  especially since version   in       and it has replaced lotus       as the industry standard for spreadsheets  excel forms part of microsoft office             microsoft excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets   using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations  it has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical  engineering and financial needs  in addition  it can display data as line graphs  histograms and charts  and with a very limited three dimensional graphical display  it allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives  using pivot tables and the scenario manager    it has a programming aspect  visual basic for applications  allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods  for example  for solving differential equations of mathematical physics    and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet  it also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user  so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so called application  or decision support system  dss   via a custom designed user interface  for example  a stock analyzer   or in general  as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports     in a more elaborate realization  an excel application can automatically poll external databases and measuring instruments using an update schedule    analyze the results  make a word report or powerpoint slide show  and e mail these presentations on a regular basis to a list of participants     microsoft allows for a number of optional command line switches to control the manner in which excel starts       the windows version of excel supports programming through microsoft s visual basic for applications  vba   which is a dialect of visual basic  programming with vba allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques  programmers may write code directly using the visual basic editor  vbe   which includes a window for writing code  debugging code  and code module organization environment  the user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in vba   and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet     vba was removed from mac excel       as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the vba engine natively to mac os x  vba was restored in the next version  mac excel            a common and easy way to generate vba code is by using the macro recorder    the macro recorder records actions of the user and generates vba code in the form of a macro  these actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro  the macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts  a command button or a graphic  the actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options  the vba code of the macro can also be edited in the vbe  certain features such as loop functions and screen prompts by their own properties  and some graphical display items  cannot be recorded  but must be entered into the vba module directly by the programmer  advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program  or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed     users should be aware that using macro recorded code may not be compatible from one version of excel to another  some code that is used in excel      can not be used in excel       making a macro that changes the cell colors and making changes to other aspects of cells may not be backward compatible     vba code interacts with the spreadsheet through the excel object model    a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects  and a set of supplied functions or methods that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users  for example  through custom toolbars or command bars and message boxes   user created vba subroutines execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder  but are more flexible and efficient     from its first version excel supported end user programming of macros  automation of repetitive tasks  and user defined functions  extension of excel s built in function library   in early versions of excel these programs were written in a macro language whose statements had formula syntax and resided in the cells of special purpose macro sheets  stored with file extension  xlm in windows   xlm was the default macro language for excel through excel        beginning with version     excel recorded macros in vba by default but with version     xlm recording was still allowed as an option  after version     that option was discontinued  all versions of excel  including excel      are capable of running an xlm macro  though microsoft discourages their use       excel supports charts  graphs  or histograms generated from specified groups of cells  the generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet  or added as a separate object     these displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells change  for example  suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually  then  in response to a user s change in trial values for parameters  the curves describing the design change shape  and their points of intersection shift  assisting the selection of the best design     versions of excel up to     had a limitation in the size of their data sets of   k               rows  versions     through      could handle   k               rows and     columns     as label  iv    version      can handle  m                 rows  and            as label  xfd   columns       microsoft excel up until      version used a proprietary binary file format called excel binary file format   xls  as its primary format    excel      uses office open xml as its primary file format  an xml based format that followed after a previous xml based format called  xml spreadsheet    xmlss    first introduced in excel            although supporting and encouraging the use of new xml based formats as replacements  excel      remained backwards compatible with the traditional  binary formats  in addition  most versions of microsoft excel can read csv  dbf  sylk  dif  and other legacy formats  support for some older file formats was removed in excel         the file formats were mainly from dos based programs     openoffice org has created documentation of the excel format    since then microsoft made the excel binary format specification available to freely download       the xml spreadsheet format introduced in excel        is a simple  xml based format missing some more advanced features like storage of vba macros  though the intended file extension for this format is  xml  the program also correctly handles xml files with  xls extension  this feature is widely used by third party applications  e g  mysql query browser  to offer  export to excel  capabilities without implementing binary file format  the following example will be correctly opened by excel if saved either as book  xml or book  xls     microsoft excel       along with the other products in the microsoft office      suite  introduced new file formats  the first of these   xlsx  is defined in the office open xml  ooxml  specification     windows applications such as microsoft access and microsoft word  as well as excel can communicate with each other and use each other s capabilities  the most common are dynamic data exchange  although strongly deprecated by microsoft  this is a common method to send data between applications running on windows  with official ms publications referring to it as  the protocol from hell     as the name suggests  it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display  it is very common in financial markets  being used to connect to important financial data services such as bloomberg and reuters     ole object linking and embedding  allows a windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data  this may take on the form of  embedding  where an application uses another to handle a task that it is more suited to  for example a powerpoint presentation may be embedded in an excel spreadsheet or vice versa             excel users can access external data sources via microsoft office features such as  for example   odc connections built with the office data connection file format  excel files themselves may be updated using a microsoft supplied odbc driver     excel can accept data in real time through several programming interfaces  which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as bloomberg and reuters  through addins such as power plus pro      alternatively  microsoft query provides odbc based browsing within microsoft excel           programmers have produced apis to open excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than microsoft excel  these include opening excel documents on the web using either activex controls  or plugins like the adobe flash player  the apache poi opensource project provides java libraries for reading and writing excel spreadsheet files  excelpackage is another open source project that provides server side generation of microsoft excel      spreadsheets  phpexcel is a php library that converts excel   excel       and excel      formats into objects for reading and writing within a web application  excel services is a current  net developer tool that can enhance excel s capabilities  excel spreadsheets can be accessed from python with xlrd and openpyxl  js xlsx and js xls can open excel spreadsheets from js     microsoft excel protection offers several types of passwords     all passwords except password to open a document can be removed instantly regardless of microsoft excel version used to create the document  these types of passwords are used primarily for shared work on a document  such password protected documents are not encrypted  and a data sources from a set password is saved in a document s header  password to protect workbook is an exception   when it is set  a document is encrypted with the standard password  velvetsweatshop   but since it is known to public  it actually does not add any extra protection to the document  the only type of password that can prevent a trespasser from gaining access to a document is password to open a document  the cryptographic strength of this kind of protection depends strongly on the microsoft excel version that was used to create the document     in microsoft excel    and earlier versions  password to open is converted to a    bit key that can be instantly cracked  in excel         the password is converted to a    bit key  which can also be cracked very quickly using modern equipment  as regards services which use rainbow tables  e g  password find   it takes up to several seconds to remove protection  in addition  password cracking programs can brute force attack passwords at a rate of hundreds of thousands of passwords a second  which not only lets them decrypt a document  but also find the original password     in excel      xp the encryption is slightly better   a user can choose any encryption algorithm that is available in the system  see cryptographic service provider   due to the csp  an excel file can t be decrypted  and thus the password to open can t be removed  though the brute force attack speed remains quite high  nevertheless  the older excel         algorithm is set by the default    therefore  users who did not changed the default settings lack reliable protection of their documents     the situation changed fundamentally in excel       where the modern aes algorithm with a key of     bits started being used for decryption  and a        fold use of the hash function sha  reduced the speed of brute force attacks down to hundreds of passwords per second  in excel       the strength of the protection by the default was increased two times due to the use of a         fold sha  to convert a password to a key     microsoft excel viewer is a freeware program for viewing and printing spreadsheet documents created by excel    excel viewer is similar to microsoft word viewer in functionality   there is not a current version for the mac   excel viewer is available for microsoft windows and windows ce handheld pcs  such as the nec mobilepro    it is also possible to open excel files using certain online tools and services  online excel viewers do not require users to have microsoft excel installed       other errors specific to excel include misleading statistics functions  mod function errors  date limitations and the excel      error       the accuracy and convenience of statistical tools in excel has been criticized            as mishandling missing data  as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round off and large numbers  as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed  and as having a limited set of statistical tools  microsoft has announced some of these issues are addressed in excel            excel has issues with modulo operations  in the case of excessively large results  excel will return the error warning  num  instead of an answer         excel includes january         and february           incorrectly treating      as a leap year      the bug originated from lotus        and was purposely implemented in excel for the purpose of bug compatibility    this legacy has later been carried over into office open xml file format    excel also does not support dates before            microsoft excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error     the reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells  if there is a cell   book  xlsxsheet    g     and there are two books named  book   open  there is no way to tell which one the user means       despite the use of    figure precision  excel can display many more figures  up to thirty  upon user request  but the displayed figures are not those actually used in its computations  and so  for example  the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values  although such departures are usually beyond the   th decimal  exceptions do occur  especially for very large or very small numbers  serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers  for example  using the excel if function   as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable     in the figure the fraction        is displayed in excel  although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones  excel displays only the leading    figures  in the second line  the number one is added to the fraction  and again excel displays only    figures  in the third line  one is subtracted from the sum using excel  because the sum in the second line has only eleven   s after the decimal  the difference when   is subtracted from this displayed value is three   s followed by a string of eleven   s  however  the difference reported by excel in the third line is three   s followed by a string of thirteen   s and two extra erroneous digits  this is because excel calculates with about half a digit more than it displays     excel works with a modified      version of the ieee     specification    excel s implementation involves conversions between binary and decimal representations  leading to accuracy that is on average better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision  but that can be worse  see the main article for details     besides accuracy in user computations  the question of accuracy in excel provided functions may be raised  particularly in the arena of statistical functions  excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation         as many calculations in excel are executed using vba  an additional issue is the accuracy of vba  which varies with variable type and user requested precision       microsoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called multiplan in       multiplan became very popular on cp m systems  but on ms dos systems it lost popularity to lotus        microsoft released the first version of excel for the macintosh on september           and the first windows version was       to synchronize with the macintosh version      in november         lotus was slow to bring       to windows and by      excel had started to outsell       and helped microsoft achieve the position of leading pc software developer  this accomplishment  dethroning the king of the software world  solidified microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future of developing gui software  microsoft pushed its advantage with regular new releases  every two years or so     excel     is the first version of excel for intel platform  there never was an excel     for dos or windows     the first windows version was labeled     to correspond to the mac version  this included a run time version of windows        included toolbars  drawing capabilities  outlining  add in support   d charts  and many more new features        introduced auto fill       also  an easter egg in excel     reveals a hidden animation of a dancing set of numbers   through    representing lotus        which was then crushed by an excel logo       with version      excel has included visual basic for applications  vba   a programming language based on visual basic which adds the ability to automate tasks in excel and to provide user defined functions  udf  for use in worksheets  vba is a powerful addition to the application and includes a fully featured integrated development environment  ide   macro recording can produce vba code replicating user actions  thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks  vba allows the creation of forms and in worksheet controls to communicate with the user  the language supports use  but not creation  of activex  com  dll s  later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic object oriented programming techniques     the automation functionality provided by vba made excel a target for macro viruses  this caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses  microsoft belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely  to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate     versions     to     of excel contain various easter eggs  including a  hall of tortured souls   although since versionxa    microsoft has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products       released in      with microsoft office for windows     this is the first major version after excel      as there is no excel         internal rewrite to    bits  almost no external changes  but faster and more stable     included in office     for x   and alpha   this was a major upgrade that introduced the paper clip office assistant and featured standard vba used instead of internal excel basic  it introduced the now removed natural language labels     this version of excel includes a flight simulator as an easter egg     included in office       this was a minor upgrade  but introduced the upgrade to the clipboard where it can hold multiple objects at once  the office assistant  whose frequent unsolicited appearance in excel    had annoyed many users  became less intrusive     included in office xp  very minor enhancements     included in office       minor enhancements  most significant being the new tables     included in office       this release was a major upgrade from the previous version  similar to other updated office products  excel in      used the new ribbon menu system  this was different from what users were used to  and was met with mixed reactions  one study reported fairly good acceptance by users except highly experienced users and users of word processing applications with a classical wimp interface  but was less convinced in terms of efficiency and organisation    however  an online survey reported that a majority of respondents had a negative opinion of the change  with advanced users being  somewhat more negative  than intermediate users  and users reporting a self estimated reduction in productivity       added functionality included the smartart set of editable business diagrams  also added was an improved management of named variables through the name manager  and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs  which allow  x  y  coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight  several improvements to pivot tables were introduced     also like other office products  the office open xml file formats were introduced  including  xlsm for a workbook with macros and  xlsx for a workbook without macros       specifically  many of the size limitations of previous versions were greatly increased  to illustrate  the number of rows was now                 and columns was              the far right column is xfd   this changes what is a valid a xa reference versus a named range  this version made more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets  however  vba macros are not handled in parallel and xll add ins were only executed in parallel if they were thread safe and this was indicated at registration     included in office       this is the next major version after v      as version number    was skipped     minor enhancements and    bit support    including the following     included in office       along with a lot of new tools included in this release     excel offers many user interface tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets  however  the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software  visicalc  the program displays cells organized in rows and columns  and each cell may contain data or a formula  with relative or absolute references to other cells     excel     for windows  which was modeled after its mac gui based counterpart  indirectly expanded the installed base of the then nascent windows environment  excel     was released a month before windows      and the installed base of windows was so low at that point in      that microsoft had to bundle a run time version of windows     with excel        unlike microsoft word  there never was a dos version of excel     excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets  fonts  character attributes and cell appearance   it also introduced intelligent cell recomputation  where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated  previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command   excel introduced auto fill  the ability to drag and expand the selection box to automatically copy cell or row contents to adjacent cells or rows  adjusting the copies intelligently by automatically incrementing cell references or contents  excel also introduced extensive graphing capabilities     because excel is widely used  it has been attacked by crackers  while excel is not directly exposed to the internet  if an attacker can get a victim to open a file in excel  and there is an appropriate security bug in excel  then the attacker can get control of the victim s computer    uk s gchq has a tool named tornado alley with this purpose
