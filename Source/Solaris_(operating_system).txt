 solaris is a unix operating system originally developed by sun microsystems  it superseded their earlier sunos in       oracle solaris  as it is now known  has been owned by oracle corporation since oracle s acquisition of sun in january           solaris is known for its scalability  especially on sparc systems  and for originating many innovative features such as dtrace  zfs and time slider    solaris supports sparc based and x   based workstations and servers from oracle and other vendors  with efforts underway to port to additional platforms  solaris is registered as compliant with the single unix specification      historically  solaris was developed as proprietary software  in june       sun microsystems released most of the codebase under the cddl license  and founded the opensolaris open source project   with opensolaris  sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software  after the acquisition of sun microsystems in january       oracle decided to discontinue the opensolaris distribution and the development model    just ten days before the internal oracle memo announcing this decision to employees was  leaked   garrett d amore had announced  the illumos project  creating a fork of the solaris kernel and launching what has since become a thriving alternative to oracle solaris     in august       oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the solaris kernel  effectively turning solaris    into a closed source proprietary operating system  however  through the oracle technology network  otn   industry partners can still gain access to the in development solaris source code   source code for the open source components of solaris    is available for download from oracle               in       at t corporation and sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular unix variants on the market at that time  bsd  system v  and xenix  this became unix system v release    svr         on september          sun announced that it would replace its existing bsd derived unix  sunos    with one based on svr   this was identified internally as sunos    but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time  solaris      although sunos     x micro releases were retroactively named solaris   by sun  the solaris name is used almost exclusively to refer to the svr  derived sunos     and later       the justification for this new  overbrand  was that it encompassed not only sunos  but also the openwindows graphical user interface and open network computing  onc  functionality  the sunos minor version is included in the solaris release number  for example  solaris     incorporated sunos      after solaris      sun dropped the      from the number  so solaris   incorporates sunos      and the latest release sunos      forms the core of solaris          solaris uses a common code base for the platforms it supports  sparc and i  pc  which includes both x   and x             solaris has a reputation for being well suited to symmetric multiprocessing  supporting a large number of cpus    it has historically been tightly integrated with sun s sparc hardware  including support for    bit sparc applications since solaris     with which it is marketed as a combined package  this has led to more reliable systems  but at a cost premium compared to commodity pc hardware  however  it has supported x   systems since solaris     and    bit x   applications since solaris     allowing sun to capitalize on the availability of commodity    bit cpus based on the x      architecture  sun has heavily marketed solaris for use with both its own  x    workstations and servers based on amd opteron and intel xeon processors  as well as x   systems manufactured by companies such as dell  hewlett packard  and ibm  as of       the following vendors support solaris for their x   server systems     as of july       dell and hp certify and resell oracle solaris  oracle enterprise linux and oracle vm on their respective x   platforms    and ibm stopped direct support for solaris on x   kit citation needed    solaris       included support for the powerpc platform  powerpc reference platform   but the port was canceled before the solaris     release    in january      a community of developers at blastwave began work on a powerpc port which they named polaris    in october       an opensolaris community project based on the blastwave efforts and sun labs  project pulsar    which re integrated the relevant parts from solaris       into opensolaris    announced its first official source code release       a port of solaris to the intel itanium architecture was announced in      but never brought to market       on november           ibm  sun  and sine nomine associates demonstrated a preview of opensolaris for system z running on an ibm system z mainframe under z vm    called sirius  in analogy to the polaris project  and also due to the primary developer s australian nationality  hms sirius of      was a ship of the first fleet to australia   on october          a prototype release of sirius was made available   and on november    the same year  ibm authorized the use of sirius on system z ifl processors       solaris also supports the linux platform abi  allowing solaris to run native linux binaries on x   systems  this feature is called  solaris containers for linux applications  or scla  based on the branded zones functionality introduced in solaris               solaris can be installed from various pre packaged software groups  ranging from a minimalistic  reduced network support  to a complete  entire plus oem   installation of solaris is not necessary for an individual to use the system  additional software  like apache  mysql  etc  can be installed as well in a packaged form from sunfreeware   and opencsw    solaris can be installed from physical media or a network for use on a desktop or server  or be without installing on a desktop or server citation needed    early releases of solaris used openwindows as the standard desktop environment  in solaris     to      openwindows supported both news and x applications  and provided backward compatibility for sunview applications from sun s older desktop environment  news allowed applications to be built in an object oriented way using postscript  a common printing language released in       the x window system originated from mit s project athena in      and allowed for the display of an application to be disconnected from the machine where the application was running  separated by a network connection  sun s original bundled sunview application suite was ported to x     sun later dropped support for legacy sunview applications and news with openwindows      which shipped with solaris      and switched to x  r  with display postscript support  the graphical look and feel remained based upon open look  openwindows       was the last release under solaris    the open look window manager  olwm  with other open look specific applications were dropped in solaris    but support libraries were still bundled  providing long term binary backwards compatibility with existing applications  the open look virtual window manager  olvwm  can still be downloaded for solaris from sunfreeware and works on releases as recent as solaris        sun and other unix vendors created an industry alliance to standardize unix desktops  as a member of cose  the common open software environment initiative  sun helped co develop the common desktop environment  cde was an initiative to create a standard unix desktop environment  each vendor contributed different components  hewlett packard contributed the window manager  ibm provided the file manager  and sun provided the e mail and calendar facilities as well as drag and drop support  tooltalk   this new desktop environment was based upon the motif look and feel and the old open look desktop environment was considered legacy  cde unified unix desktops across multiple open system vendors  cde was available as an unbundled add on for solaris     and      and was included in solaris     through     in       sun issued a preview release of the open source desktop environment gnome      based on the gtk  toolkit  for solaris      solaris        introduced gnome     as an alternative to cde  solaris    includes sun s java desktop system  jds   which is based on gnome and comes with a large set of applications  including staroffice  sun s office suite  sun describes jds as a  major component  of solaris       the java desktop system is not included in solaris    which instead ships with a stock version of gnome    likewise  cde applications are no longer included in solaris     but many libraries remain for binary backwards compatibility     the open source desktop environments kde and xfce  along with numerous other window managers  also compile and run on recent versions of solaris     sun was investing in a new desktop environment called project looking glass since       the project has been inactive since late            from            when solaris was still being developed by sun microsystems  solaris  source code  with a few exceptions  was released under the common development and distribution license  cddl  via the opensolaris project       when sun was acquired by oracle in      the opensolaris project was discontinued after the board became unhappy with oracle s stance on the project    in march       the previously freely available solaris    was placed under a restrictive license that limited the use  modification and redistribution of the operating system    the license allowed the user to download the operating system free of charge  through the oracle technology network  and use it for a    day trial period  after that trial period had expired the user would then have to purchase a support contract from oracle to continue using the operating system     with the release of solaris    in      the license terms changed again  the new license allows solaris    and solaris    to be downloaded free of charge from the oracle technology network and used without a support contract indefinitely however the license only expressly permits the user to use solaris as a development platform and expressly forbids commercial and  production  use    there is some uncertainty over whether solaris can be used at home for hobbyist and educational purposes  oracle has not officially clarified its position on home use     when solaris is used without a support contract it can be upgraded annually to each new  point release  however a support contract is required for access to patches and updates that are released monthly       notable features of solaris currently include dtrace  doors  service management facility  solaris containers  solaris multiplexed i o  solaris volume manager  zfs  and solaris trusted extensions     updates to solaris versions are periodically released  such as solaris              in ascending order  the following versions of solaris have been released             na more comprehensive summary of some solaris versions is also available    solaris releases are also described in the solaris   faq       the underlying solaris codebase has been under continuous development since work began in the late     s on what was eventually released as solaris      each version such as solaris    is based on a snapshot of this development codebase  taken near the time of its release  which is then maintained as a derived project  updates to that project are built and delivered several times a year until the next official release comes out     the solaris version under development by sun since the release of solaris    in      is codenamed nevada  and is derived from what is now the opensolaris codebase     in       an addition to the solaris development process was initiated  under the program name software express for solaris  or just solaris express   a binary release based on the current development basis was made available for download on a monthly basis  allowing anyone to try out new features and test the quality and stability of the os as it progressed to the release of the next official solaris version    a later change to this program introduced a quarterly release model with support available  renamed solaris express developer edition  sxde      in       sun announced project indiana with several goals  including providing an open source binary distribution of the opensolaris project  replacing sxde    the first release of this distribution was opensolaris             the solaris express community edition  sxce  was intended specifically for opensolaris developers    it was updated every two weeks until it was discontinued in january       with a recommendation that users migrate to the opensolaris distribution    although the download license seen when downloading the image files indicates its use is limited to personal  educational and evaluation purposes  the license acceptance form displayed when the user actually installs from these images lists additional uses including commercial and production environments     sxce releases terminated with build     and opensolaris releases terminated with build     a few weeks later  the next release of opensolaris based on build     was due in march      but it was never fully released  though the packages were made available on the package repository  instead  oracle renamed the binary distribution solaris    express  changed the license terms and released build    a as         in november
