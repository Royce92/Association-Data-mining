 a small form factor  sff  is a computer form factor designed to minimize the volume of a desktop computer  for comparison purposes  the size of an sff case is usually measured in litres  sffs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes  including shoeboxes  cubes  and book sized pcs  their smaller and often lighter construction has made them popular as home theater pcs and as gaming computers for attending lan parties  manufacturers also emphasize the aesthetic and ergonomic design of sffs since users are more likely to place them on top of a desk or carry them around     small form factors do not include computing devices that have traditionally been small  such as embedded or mobile systems   however   small form factor  lacks a normative definition and is consequently open to interpretation and misuse  manufacturers often provide definitions that serve the interests of their products              the acronym sff  originally stood for  shuttle form factor   describing shoebox sized personal computers with two expansion slots   the meaning of sff evolved to include other  similar pc designs from brands such as aopen and first international computer  with the word  small  replacing the word  shuttle      sff originally referred to systems smaller than the micro atx  the term sff is used in contrast with terms for larger systems such as  mini towers  and  desktops       small form factor computers are generally designed to support the same features as modern desktop computers  but in a smaller space  most accept standard x   microprocessors  standard dimm memory modules  standard    xa inch hard disks  and standard     xa inch optical drives     however  the small size of sff cases may limit expansion options  many commercial offerings provide only one      drive bay and one or two       external bays  standard cpu heatsinks do not always fit inside an sff computer  so some manufacturers provide custom cooling systems  though limited to one or two expansion cards  a few have the space for     length cards such as the geforce gtx       most sff computers use highly integrated motherboards containing many on board peripherals  reducing the need for expansion cards     even if labeled  sff   cube style cases that support full sized  ps  form factor  power supplies actually have a microatx form factor  true sff systems use tfx or smaller power supplies  and some require a notebook pc style external  power brick      some sff computers even include compact components designed for mobile computers  such as notebook optical drives  notebook memory modules  notebook processors  and external ac adapters  rather than the internal power supply units found in full size desktop computers     the many different types of sffs  are categorized loosely by their shape and size  the ones below are available as of     update     many sff computers have a cubic shape  smaller models are typically sold as barebones units  including a case  motherboard  and power supply designed to fit together  the motherboard lies flat against the base of the case  upgrade options may be limited by the non standard motherboards  cramped interior space  and power and airflow concerns  the power mac g  cube  released in       and the shuttle xpc are good examples of this design  msi and asus produce similar designs  the xi  modular computer is an example of a cube computer with a little more upgrade possibilities     shuttle has adapted several of its xpc models to alternately accept mini itx motherboards  the base of the xpc is provided with mounting points which accommodate both  shuttle form factor   shff  and mini itx motherbboards  in order to accommodate mini itx motherboards  two of the shff mounting points are simply relocated  the other two mini itx mounting points are in common with shff mounting points      aopen inc  produced a stackable s     case  allowing the user to stack up to four components vertically or horizontally  these layers can be for add on cards  optical drives  and hard drives  using either internal power supplies or external ac adapter power sources  after the s     aopen made more small form factor cases for systems with micro atx and mini itx     until recently  sff cases were usually sold as barebones units  case  power supply  and motherboard  to system integraters and home based builders  in       apple inc  introduced its mac mini  volume of     l  excluding external power brick   later in the same year  the first aopen mini pc mp     renamed to xc mini in      since  mini pc  could not be registered as a trademark   was announced  the size of the xc mini series pc       w       h        d  mm   makes it one of the smallest desktop pc systems     l volume   it was criticized for looking like the apple mac mini  but apple has not taken action on this subject  in february       aopen redesigned the case of the mini pc mp    series     since       major oem pc brands such as hp and dell have begun to sell fully assembled sff systems  these are often described as bookshelf units since they resemble a miniature tower case small enough to fit on a bookshelf  the hp slimline series and dell c     volume     xa l  are good examples of this trend  the maxdata favorite    xs is another mini computer  the hp slimline uses a non standard motherboard that is very similar in size to mini itx      in addition to its industrial use  the extremely small mini itx motherboard form factor has also been incorporated into sff computers  these are often extremely compact  incorporating low power components such as the via c  processors  the travla c    is an example of this design  it is somewhat larger than the mac mini          vs              and barely bigger than a standard       optical drive     beginning in       several other companies have released other very small computers that besides a small size  focus on a low price  and extremely high power efficiency  typically   xa w or below in use   these include the zonbu  fit pc  linutop  and a home  with the release of intel atom cpu  aopen also made nettop systems  the ubox series with model le    and le      the ubox series equips a dual core intel atom         processor  single channel ddr ii         memory  intel    gc ich  chipset  three sata connectors and    channel high definition audio output     essentially a bookshelf style case lying on its side  a miniature htpc replicates the look of other smaller than rack sized home theatre components such as a dvr or mini audio receiver  the front panel interface is emphasized  with the optical disc drive rotated relative to the case in order to maintain horizontal mounting  and more motherboard port connectors  such as for usb  are routed to the front panel  they normally are as powerful as pc desktops     a computer on module  com  is a complete computer built on a single circuit board  they are often used as embedded systems due to their small physical size and low power consumption  gumstix is one manufacturer of coms     each model of dell s optiplex line of computers typically includes an ultra small form factor  usff  chassis option  in the core   era  these machines used      desktop hard drives and external power supplies  like the optiplex     and      more recent units use      laptop hard drives and have integrated power supplies  like the optiplex     usff  the compact size comes at the cost of restricted expandability  as usff models have no pci or pcie slots and may have limited cpu and memory options     understood as comprising nano itx     cm      cm  and pico itx     cm       cm  boards  the format was championed by via technologies    intel now describes its own next unit of
