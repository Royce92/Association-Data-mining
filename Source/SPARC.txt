 sparc  from  scalable processor architecture   is a risc instruction set architecture  isa  developed by sun microsystems and introduced in mid          sparc is a registered trademark of sparc international  inc   an organization established in      to promote the sparc architecture  manage sparc trademarks  and provide conformance testing  implementations of the original    bit sparc architecture were initially designed and used in sun s sun   workstation and server systems  replacing their earlier sun   systems based on the motorola       family of processors  later  sparc processors were used in smp and cc numa servers produced by sun  solbourne and fujitsu  among others  and designed for    bit operation     sparc international was intended to open the sparc architecture to make a larger ecosystem for the design  which has been licensed to several manufacturers  including texas instruments  atmel  cypress semiconductor  and fujitsu  as a result of sparc international  the sparc architecture is fully open and non proprietary     in march      the complete design of sun s ultrasparc t  microprocessor was released in open source form at opensparc net and named the opensparc t   in      the design of sun s ultrasparc t  microprocessor was also released in open source form as opensparc t       the most recent commercial iterations of the sparc processor design are the fujitsu laboratories ltd  s eight core  venus      gflop     xa ghz sparc   viiifx introduced june       which is used in the   petaflops japanese supercomputer  k computer   sparc   x  athena  introduced in august        and the    core sparc t  introduced by oracle corporation in march       running at    xa ghz             the sparc architecture was heavily influenced by the earlier risc designs including the risc i and ii from the university of california  berkeley and the ibm      these original risc designs were minimalist  including as few features or op codes as possible and aiming to execute instructions at a rate of almost one instruction per clock cycle  this made them similar to the mips architecture in many ways  including the lack of instructions such as multiply or divide  another feature of sparc influenced by this early risc movement is the branch delay slot     the sparc processor usually contains as many as     general purpose registers  at any point  only    of them are immediately visible to software     are a set of global registers  one of which  g   is hard wired to zero  so only   of them are usable as registers  and the other    are from the stack of registers  these    registers form what is called a register window  and at function call return  this window is moved up and down the register stack  each window has   local registers and shares   registers with each of the adjacent windows  the shared registers are used for passing function parameters and returning values  and the local registers are used for retaining local values across function calls     the  scalable  in sparc comes from the fact that the sparc specification allows implementations to scale from embedded processors up through large server processors  all sharing the same core  non privileged  instruction set  one of the architectural parameters that can scale is the number of implemented register windows  the specification allows from   to    windows to be implemented  so the implementation can choose to implement all    to provide maximum call stack efficiency  or to implement only   to reduce cost and complexity of the design  or to implement some number between them  other architectures that include similar register file features include intel i     ia     and amd           the architecture has gone through several revisions  it gained hardware multiply and divide functionality in version         bit  addressing and data  were added to the version   sparc specification published in           in sparc version    the floating point register file has    double precision registers  each of them can be used as two single precision registers  providing a total of    single precision registers  an odd even number pair of double precision registers can be used as a quad precision register  thus allowing   quad precision registers  sparc version   added    more double precision registers  which can also be accessed as   quad precision registers   but these additional registers can not be accessed as single precision registers  no sparc cpu implements quad precision operations in hardware as of           tagged add and subtract instructions perform adds and subtracts on values checking that the bottom two bits of both operands are   and reporting overflow if they are not  this can be useful in the implementation of the run time for ml  lisp  and similar languages that might use a tagged integer format     the endianness of the    bit sparc v  architecture is purely big endian  the    bit sparc v  architecture uses big endian instructions  but can access data in either big endian or little endian byte order  chosen either at the application instruction  load store  level or at the memory page level  via an mmu setting   the latter is often used for accessing data from inherently little endian devices  such as those on pci buses     there have been three major revisions of the architecture  the first published revision was the    bit sparc version    v   in       sparc version    v    an enhanced sparc architecture definition  was released in       the main differences between v  and v  were the addition of integer multiply and divide instructions  and an upgrade from    bit  extended precision  floating point arithmetic to     bit  quad precision  arithmetic  sparc v  served as the basis for ieee standard            an ieee standard for a    bit microprocessor architecture     sparc version    the    bit sparc architecture  was released by sparc international in       it was developed by the sparc architecture committee consisting of amdahl corporation  fujitsu  icl  lsi logic  matsushita  philips  ross technology  sun microsystems  and texas instruments     in       the sparc joint programming specification    jps   was released by fujitsu and sun  describing processor functions which were identically implemented in the cpus of both companies   commonality    the first cpus conforming to jps  were the ultrasparc iii by sun and the sparc   v by fujitsu  functionalities which are not covered by jps  are documented for each processor in  implementation supplements      in early       sun released an extended architecture specification  ultrasparc architecture       this includes not only the non privileged and most of the privileged portions of sparc v   but also all the architectural extensions developed through the processor generations of ultrasparc iii  iv  iv  as well as cmt extensions starting with the ultrasparc t  implementation     ultrasparc architecture      includes sun s standard extensions and remains compliant with the full sparc v  level   specification     in       sun released an updated specification  ultrasparc architecture       to which the ultrasparc t  implementation complied     in august        oracle corporation made available a new specification  oracle sparc architecture       which besides the overall update of the reference  adds the vis   instructions set extensions to      specification      the architecture has provided continuous application binary compatibility from the first sparc v  implementation in      into the sun ultrasparc architecture implementations     among various implementations of sparc  sun s supersparc and ultrasparc i were very popular  and were used as reference systems for spec cpu   and cpu     benchmarks  the    xa mhz ultrasparc ii is the reference system for the spec cpu     benchmark     the sparc architecture has been licensed to many companies who have developed and fabricated implementations such as     this table contains specifications for certain sparc processors  frequency  megahertz   architecture version  release year

   three fully open source implementations of the sparc architecture exist     a fully open source simulator for the sparc architecture also exists     fujitsu s k computer ranked    in top      june

computer was more powerful than the next five systems on the list combined  and had the highest performance to power ratio of any other supercomputer system    it also ranked    in green      june
