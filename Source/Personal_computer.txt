 a personal computer is a general purpose computer whose size  capabilities and original sale price make it useful for individuals  and is intended to be operated directly by an end user with no intervening computer operator  this contrasts with the batch processing or time sharing models that allowed larger  more expensive minicomputer and mainframe systems to be used by many people  usually at the same time  a related term is  pc  that was initially an acronym for  personal computer   but later became used primarily to refer to the ubiquitous wintel platform     software applications for most personal computers include  but are not limited to  word processing  spreadsheets  databases  web browsers and e mail clients  digital media playback  games and myriad personal productivity and special purpose software applications  modern personal computers often have connections to the internet  allowing access to the world wide web and a wide range of other resources  personal computers may be connected to a local area network  lan   either by a cable or a wireless connection  a personal computer may be a desktop computer or a laptop  netbook  tablet or a handheld pc     early computer owners usually had to write their own programs to do anything useful with the machines  which even did not include an operating system  the very earliest microcomputers  equipped with a front panel  required hand loading of a bootstrap program to load programs from external storage  paper tape  cassettes  or eventually diskettes   before very long  automatic booting from permanent read only memory became universal  today s users have access to a wide range of commercial software  freeware and free and open source software  which are provided in ready to run or ready to compile form  software for personal computers  such as applications and video games  are typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or os manufacturers  whereas software for many mobile phones and other portable systems is approved and distributed through a centralized online store       since the early     s  microsoft operating systems and intel hardware have dominated much of the personal computer market  first with ms dos and then with windows  popular alternatives to microsoft s windows operating systems include apple s os x and free open source unix like operating systems such as linux and bsd  amd provides the major alternative to intel s processors             the programma     was the first commercial  desktop personal computer   produced by the italian company olivetti and invented by the italian engineer pier giorgio perotto  inventor of the magnetic card system  the project started in       it was launched at the      new york world s fair  and volume production began in       the computer retailing for         unreliable source     nasa bought at least ten programma    s and used them for the calculations for the      apollo    moon landing  then abc used the programma     to predict the presidential election of       and the u s  military used the machine to plan their operations in the vietnam war  the programma     was also used in schools  hospitals  government offices  this marked the beginning of the era of the personal computer     in       hewlett packard was ordered to pay about          in royalties to olivetti after their hewlett packard     a was ruled to have copied some of the solutions adopted in the programma      including the magnetic card  the architecture and other similar components      the soviet mir series of computers was developed from      to      in a group headed by victor glushkov  it was designed as a relatively small scale computer for use in engineering and scientific applications and contained a hardware implementation of a high level programming language  another innovative feature for that time was the user interface combining a keyboard with a monitor and light pen for correcting texts and drawing on screen      in what was later to be called the mother of all demos  sri researcher douglas engelbart in      gave a preview of what would become the staples of daily working life in the   st century  e mail  hypertext  word processing  video conferencing and the mouse  the demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time     by the early     s  people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations  although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person     in      the ibm los gatos scientific center developed a portable computer prototype called scamp  special computer apl machine portable  based on the ibm palm processor with a philips compact cassette drive  small crt and full function keyboard  scamp emulated an ibm      minicomputer in order to run apl       in      apl was generally available only on mainframe computers  and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the wang      or hp      offered only basic  because scamp was the first to emulate apl     performance on a portable  single user computer  pc magazine in      designated scamp a  revolutionary concept  and  the world s first personal computer     this seminal  single user portable computer now resides in the smithsonian institution  washington  d c   successful demonstrations of the      scamp prototype led to the ibm      portable microcomputer launched in      with the ability to be programmed in both apl and basic for engineers  analysts  statisticians and other business problem solvers  in the late     s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton      another seminal product in      was the xerox alto  developed at xerox s palo alto research center  parc   it had a graphical user interface  gui  which later served as inspiration for apple computer s macintosh  and microsoft s windows operating system  also in      hewlett packard introduced fully basic programmable microcomputers that fit entirely on top of a desk  including a keyboard  a small one line display and printer  the wang      microcomputer of      had a full size cathode ray tube  crt  and cassette tape storage   these were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses  the introduction of the microprocessor  a single chip with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets  led to the proliferation of personal computers after          early personal computers u   bgenerally called microcomputers u   bwere often sold in a kit form and in limited volumes  and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians  minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions  and output was provided by front panel lamps  practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards  computer displays  disk drives  and printers  micral n was the earliest commercial  non kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor  the intel       it was built starting in      and about        units were sold     in      steve jobs and steve wozniak sold the apple i computer circuit board  which was fully prepared and contained about    chips  the apple i computer differed from the other hobby computers of the time at the beckoning of paul terrell owner of the byte shop who gave steve jobs his first purchase order for    apple i computers only if the computers were assembled and tested and not a kit computer so he would have computers to sell to everyone  not just people that could assemble a computer kit  the apple i as delivered was still a kit computer as it did not have a power supply  case  or keyboard as delivered to the byte shop     the first successfully mass marketed personal computer was the commodore pet introduced in january       but back ordered and not available until later in the year  at the same time  the apple ii  usually referred to as the  apple   was introduced   june        and the trs    from tandy corporation   tandy radio shack in summer       delivered in september in a small number  mass market ready assembled computers allowed a wider range of people to use computers  focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware     during the early     s  home computers were further developed for household use  with software for personal productivity  programming and games  they typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display  with low detail blocky graphics and a limited color range  and text about    characters wide by    characters tall  sinclair research   a uk company  produced the zx series   the zx           zx           and the zx spectrum  the latter was introduced in       and totaled   million unit sold  following came the commodore     totaled    million units sold         in the same year  the nec pc    was introduced  which was a very popular personal computer that sold in more than    million units    another famous personal computer  the revolutionary amiga       was unveiled by commodore on july          at the vivian beaumont theater in the lincoln center in new york  the amiga      featured a multitasking  windowing operating system  color graphics with a      color palette  stereo sound  motorola       cpu      kb ram  and     kb     inch disk drive  for us             somewhat larger and more expensive systems  for example  running cp m   or sometimes a home computer with additional interfaces and devices  although still low cost compared with minicomputers and mainframes  were aimed at office and small business use  typically using  high resolution  monitors capable of at least    column text display  and often no graphical or color drawing capability     workstations were characterized by high performance processors and graphics displays  with large capacity local disk storage  networking capability  and running under a multitasking operating system     eventually  due to the influence of the ibm pc on the personal computer market  personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction  business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound  and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers  mass market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before  even local area networking  originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals  became a standard feature of personal computers used at home     in       the computer  was named machine of the year by time magazine     in the     s  several companies such as hewlett packard and sony sold off their pc and laptop divisions  as a result  the personal computer was declared dead several times during this time       in           million personal computers were shipped in comparison to        in         more than     million personal computers were in use in      and one billion personal computers had been sold worldwide from the mid     s up to this time  of the latter figure      were professional or work related  while the rest were sold for personal or home use  about       of personal computers shipped had been desktop computers        laptops and      servers  the united states had received            million  of the computers shipped  europe     and       had gone to the asia pacific region  the fastest growing market as of       the second billion was expected to be sold by         almost half of all households in western europe had a personal computer and a computer could be found in     of homes in united kingdom  compared with only     in            the global personal computer shipments were       million units in               million units in        and       million units in           the shipments were     million units in the year       according to isuppli    up       from     million in         in       the global shipments were     million units  an       increase over         in             million computers were shipped  at an estimated value of      billion    in             million pcs were shipped  at an estimated value of      billion    in             million personal computers were shipped  at an estimated value of      billion    worldwide shipments of personal computers surpassed the     million mark in       growing to       million units from      million units in         in       asia had      million units shipped       as of june       the number of personal computers in use worldwide hit one billion    while another billion is expected to be reached by       mature markets like the united states  western europe and japan accounted for     of the worldwide installed pcs  the emerging markets were expected to double their installed pcs by      and to take     of the second billion pcs  about     million computers      of the existing installed base  were expected to be replaced and    million to be dumped into landfill in       the whole installed base grew     annually         based on international data corporation  idc  data for q        for the first time china surpassed us in pc shipments by      million and      million respectively  this trend reflects the rising of emerging markets as well as the relative stagnation of mature regions       in the developed world  there has been a vendor tradition to keep adding functions to maintain high prices of personal computers  however  since the introduction of the one laptop per child foundation and its low cost xo   laptop  the computing industry started to pursue the price too  although introduced only one year earlier  there were    million netbooks sold in         besides the regular computer manufacturers  companies making especially rugged versions of computers have sprung up  offering alternatives for people operating their machines in extreme weather or environments       deloitte consulting firm predicted that in       smartphones and tablet computers as computing devices would surpass the pcs sales    as of       worldwide sales of pcs had begun to fall as many consumers moved to tablets and smartphones for gifts and personal use  sales of      million units in the  th quarter of      represented a      decline from sales in the  th quarter of         global pc sales fell sharply in the first quarter of       according to idc data  the     year over year decline was the largest on record since the firm began tracking in       and double what analysts had been expecting      the decline of q       pc shipments marked the fifth straight quarter of falling sales     this is horrific news for pcs   remarked an analyst   it s all about mobile computing now  we have definitely reached the tipping point     data from gartner inc  showed a similar decline for the same time period    china s lenovo group bucked the general trend as strong sales to first time buyers in the developing world allowed the company s sales to stay flat overall    windows    which was designed to look similar to tablet smartphone software  was cited as a contributing factor in the decline of new pc sales   unfortunately  it seems clear that the windows   launch not only didn t provide a positive boost to the pc market  but appears to have slowed the market   said idc vice president bob o donnell       in august       credit suisse published research findings that attributed around     of the operating profit share of the pc industry to microsoft  operating system  and intel  semiconductors        according to idc  in      pc shipments dropped by      as the greatest drop ever in line with consumers trends to use mobile devices       selling prices of personal computers  unlike other consumer commodities  steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture  capabilities of the computers also increased  in       an altair kit sold for only around us       but required customers to solder components into circuit boards  peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another         and the resultant system was only of use to hobbyists       at their introduction in       the us        price of the osborne   and its competitor kaypro was considered an attractive price point  these systems had text only displays and only floppy disks for storage  by       michael dell observed that a personal computer system selling at retail for about        us was made of components that cost the dealer about       typical gross margin on a computer unit was around           the total value of personal computer purchases in the us in      was about    billion  comparable to total sales of pet food  by late       the average selling price of personal computer systems in the united states had dropped below              for microsoft windows systems  the average selling price  asp  showed a decline in            possibly due to low cost netbooks  drawing      for desktop computers and      for laptops at u s  retail in august       in       asp had further fallen to      for desktops and to      for notebooks by january and to      and      in february    according to research firm npd  the average selling price of all windows portable pcs has fallen from      in october      to      in october             pc  is an initialism for  personal computer   however  it is used in a different sense  it means a personal computers with an intel x   compatible processor running microsoft windows  sometimes called wintel    pc  is used in contrast with  mac   an apple macintosh computer          this sense of the word is used in get a mac advertisement campaign that run between      to       as well as its rival  i m a pc campaign  that appeared on          a workstation is a high end personal computer designed for technical  mathematical  or scientific applications  intended primarily to be used by one person at a time  they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi user operating systems  workstations are used for tasks such as computer aided design  drafting and modeling  computation intensive scientific and engineering calculations  image processing  architectural modeling  and computer graphics for animation and motion picture visual effects       prior to the widespread usage of pcs  a computer that could fit on a desk was remarkably small  leading to the  desktop  nomenclature  more recently  the phrase usually indicates a particular style of computer case  desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases to small models which can be tucked behind an lcd monitor  in this sense  the term  desktop  refers specifically to a horizontally oriented case  usually intended to have the display screen placed on top to save desk space  most modern desktop computers have separate screens and keyboards     a gaming computer is a standard desktop computer that typically has high performance hardware  such as a more powerful video card  processor and memory  in order to handle the requirements of demanding video games  which are often simply called  pc games   a number of companies  such as alienware  manufacture prebuilt gaming computers  and companies such as razer and logitech market mice  keyboards and headsets geared toward gamers     single unit pcs  also known as all in one pcs  are a subtype of desktop computers that combine the monitor and case of the computer within a single unit  the monitor often utilizes a touchscreen as an optional method of user input  but separate keyboards and mice are normally still included  the inner components of the pc are often located directly behind the monitor and many of such pcs are built similarly to laptops     a subtype of desktops  called nettops  was introduced by intel in february       characterized by low cost and lean functionality  a similar subtype of laptops  or notebooks  is the netbook  described below  the product line features the new intel atom processor  which specifically enables nettops to consume less power and fit into small enclosures     a home theater pc  htpc  is a convergence device that combines the functions of a personal computer and a digital video recorder  it is connected to a tv set or an appropriately sized computer display  and is often used as a digital photo viewer  music and video player  tv receiver  and digital video recorder  htpcs are also referred to as media center systems or media servers  the general goal in a htpc is usually to combine many or all components of a home theater setup into one box  more recently  htpcs gained the ability to connect to services providing on demand movies and tv shows     htpcs can be purchased pre configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the pc  or can be cobbled together out of discrete components  what is commonly done with software support from mythtv  windows media center  gb pvr  sagetv  famulent or linuxmce     a laptop computer or simply laptop  also called a notebook computer  is a small personal computer designed for portability  usually  all of the hardware and interfaces needed to operate a laptop  such as the graphics card  audio devices or usb ports  previously parallel and serial ports   are built into a single unit  laptops contain high capacity batteries that can power the device for extensive periods of time  enhancing portability  once the battery charge is depleted  it will have to be recharged through a power outlet  in the interests of saving power  weight and space  laptop graphics cards are in many cases integrated into the cpu or chipset and use system ram  resulting in reduced graphics performance when compared to an equivalent desktop machine  for this reason  desktop or gaming computers are usually preferred to laptop pcs for gaming purposes     one of the drawbacks of laptops is that  due to the size and configuration of components  usually relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design  internal upgrades are either not manufacturer recommended  can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge  or in some cases impossible  making the desktop pc more modular  some internal upgrades  such as memory and hard disk drive upgrades are often easily performed  while a display or keyboard upgrade is usually impossible  just as desktops  laptops also have the same possibilities for connecting to a wide variety of devices  including external displays  mice  cameras  storage devices and keyboards  which may be attached externally through usb ports and other less common ports such as external video     a subtype of notebooks  called subnotebook  has most of the features of a standard laptop computer  but with smaller physical dimensions  subnotebooks are larger than hand held computers  and usually run full versions of desktop or laptop operating systems  ultra mobile pcs  umpc  are usually considered subnotebooks  or more specifically  subnotebook tablet pcs  which are described below  netbooks are sometimes considered to belong to this category  though they are sometimes separated into a category of their own  see below      a desktop replacement computer  dtr  is a personal computer that provides the full capabilities of a desktop computer while remaining mobile  such computers are often actually larger  bulkier laptops  because of their increased size  this class of computers usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally found in smaller portable computers  and can have a relatively limited battery capacity or none at all in some cases  some use a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance at the expense of battery life  desktop replacement computers are sometimes called desknotes  as a portmanteau of words  desktop  and  notebook   though the term is also applied to desktop replacement computers in general       netbooks  also called mini notebooks or subnotebooks  are a subgroup of laptops   acting as a category of small  lightweight and inexpensive laptop computers suited for general computing tasks and accessing web based applications  they are often marketed as  companion devices   with an intention to augment other ways in which a user can access computer resources    walt mossberg called them a  relatively new category of small  light  minimalist and cheap laptops     by august       cnet called netbooks  nothing more than smaller  cheaper notebooks        initially  the primary defining characteristic of netbooks was the lack of an optical disc drive  requiring it to be a separate external device  this has become less important as flash memory devices have gradually increased in capacity  replacing the writable optical disc  e g  cd rw  dvd rw  as a transportable storage medium     at their inception in late      u   bas smaller notebooks optimized for low weight and low cost   u   bnetbooks omitted key features  e g   the optical drive   featured smaller screens and keyboards  and offered reduced specifications and computing power  over the course of their evolution  netbooks have ranged in their screen sizes from below five inches   to over    inches    with weights around    kg      pounds   often significantly less expensive than other laptops    by mid      netbooks had been offered to users  free of charge   with an extended service contract purchase of a cellular data plan       in the short period since their appearance  netbooks have grown in size and features  converging with new smaller and lighter notebooks  by mid       cnet noted that  the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other   noting  the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices        a tablet is a type of portable pc that de emphasizes the use of traditional input devices  such as a mouse or keyboard  by using a touchscreen display  which can be controlled using either a stylus pen or finger  some tablets may use a  hybrid  or  convertible  design  offering a keyboard that can either be removed as an attachment  or a screen that can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard     some tablets may run a traditional pc operating system such as windows or linux  microsoft attempted to enter the tablet market in      with its microsoft tablet pc specifications  for tablets and convertible laptops running windows xp  however  microsoft s early attempts were overshadowed by the release of apple s ipad  following in its footsteps  most modern tablets use slate designs and run mobile operating systems such as android and ios  giving them functionality similar to smartphones  in response  microsoft built its windows   operating system to better accommodate these new touch oriented devices       the ultra mobile pc  umpc  is a specification for small configuration tablet pcs  it was developed as a joint development exercise by microsoft  intel and samsung  among others  current umpcs typically feature the windows xp  windows vista  windowsxa    or linux operating system  and low voltage intel atom or via c  m processors     a pocket pc is a hardware specification for a handheld sized computer  personal digital assistant  pda  that runs the microsoft windows mobile operating system  it may have the capability to run an alternative operating system like netbsd or linux  pocket pcs have many of the capabilities of modern desktop pcs     numerous applications are available for handhelds adhering to the microsoft pocket pc specification  many of which are freeware  some of these devices also include mobile phone features  actually representing a smartphone  microsoft compliant pocket pcs can also be used with many other add ons like gps receivers  barcode readers  rfid readers and cameras  in       with the release of windows mobile    microsoft dropped the name pocket pc in favor of a new naming scheme  devices without an integrated phone are called windows mobile classic instead of pocket pc  while devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called windows mobile professional       computer hardware is a comprehensive term for all physical parts of a computer  as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on  and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks  the boundary between hardware and software might be slightly blurry  with the existence of firmware that is software  built into  the hardware     mass market consumer computers use highly standardized components and so are simple for an end user to assemble into a working system  a typical desktop computer consists of a computer case that holds the power supply  motherboard  hard disk drive  and often an optical disc drive  external devices such as a computer monitor or visual display unit  keyboard  and a pointing device are usually found in a personal computer     the motherboard connects all processor  memory and peripheral devices together  the ram  graphics card and processor are in most cases mounted directly onto the motherboard  the central processing unit  microprocessor chip  plugs into a cpu socket  while the memory modules plug into corresponding memory sockets  some motherboards have the video display adapter  sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard  while others use expansion slots for graphics cards  network cards  or other i o devices  the graphics card or sound card may employ a break out box to keep the analog parts away from the electromagnetic radiation inside the computer case  disk drives  which provide mass storage  are connected to the motherboard with one cable  and to the power supply through another cable  usually  disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard  expansion chassis are also made for additional disk storage  for extended amounts of data  a tape drive can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case     the keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an i o panel on the back of the computer case  the monitor is also connected to the i o panel  either through an onboard port on the motherboard  or a port on the graphics card     capabilities of the personal computers hardware can sometimes be extended by the addition of expansion cards connected via an expansion bus  standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers include pci  pci express  pcie   and agp  a high speed pci bus dedicated to graphics adapters  found in older computers   most modern personal computers have multiple physical pci express expansion slots  with some of the having pci slots as well     a computer case is an enclosure that contains the main components of a computer  they are usually constructed from steel or aluminum combined with plastic  although other materials such as wood have been used  cases are available in different sizes and shapes  the size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the configuration of the motherboard that it is designed to accommodate  since this is the largest and most central component of most computers     the most popular style for desktop computers is atx  although microatx and similar layouts became very popular for a variety of uses  companies like shuttle inc  and aopen have popularized small cases  for which flexatx is the most common motherboard size     the power supply unit  psu  converts general purpose mains ac electricity to direct current  dc  for the other components of the computer  the rated output capacity of a psu should usually be about     greater than the calculated system power consumption needs obtained by adding up all the system components  this protects against overloading the supply  and guards against performance degradation     the central processing unit  or cpu  is a part of a computer that executes instructions of a software program  in newer pcs  the cpu contains over a million transistors in one integrated circuit chip called the microprocessor  in most cases  the microprocessor plugs directly into the motherboard  the chip generates so much heat that the pc builder is required to attach a special cooling device to its surface  thus  modern cpus are equipped with a fan attached via heat sink     ibm pc compatible computers use an x   compatible microprocessor  manufactured by intel  amd  via technologies or transmeta  apple macintosh computers were initially built with the motorola    x  family of processors  then switched to the powerpc series  in       they switched to x   compatible processors made by intel     the motherboard  also referred to as system board or main board  is the primary circuit board within a personal computer  and other major system components plug directly into it or via a cable  a motherboard contains a microprocessor  the cpu supporting circuitry  mostly integrated circuits  that provide the interface between memory and input output peripheral circuits  main memory  and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after power on  often called boot firmware or  in ibm pc compatible computers  a bios or uefi      in many portable and embedded personal computers  the motherboard houses nearly all of the pc s core components  often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes  sometimes a secondary daughter board is connected to the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints     a pc s main memory is a fast primary storage device that is directly accessible by the cpu  and is used to store the currently executing program and immediately needed data  pcs use semiconductor random access memory  ram  of various kinds such as dram  sdram or sram as their primary storage  which exact kind is used depends on cost performance issues at any particular time     main memory is much faster than mass storage devices like hard disk drives or optical discs  but is usually volatile  meaning that it does not retain its contents  instructions or data  in the absence of power  and is much more expensive for a given capacity than is most mass storage  as a result  main memory is generally not suitable for long term or archival data storage     mass storage devices store programs and data even when the power is off  they do require power to perform read and write functions during usage  although flash memory has dropped in cost  the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the hard disk drive     if the mass storage controller provides additional ports for expandability  a pc may also be upgraded by the addition of extra hard disk or optical disc drives  for example  bd roms  dvd rws  and various optical disc recorders may all be added by the user to certain pcs  standard internal storage device connection interfaces are pata  serial ata and scsi     solid state drives  ssds  are a much faster  but also a much more expensive  replacement for traditional mechanical hard disk drives     a visual display unit  computer monitor or just display  is a piece of electrical equipment  usually separate from the computer case  which displays visual images without producing a permanent computer record  a display device is usually either a crt or some form of flat panel such as a tft lcd  multi monitor setups are also quite common     the display unit houses an electronic circuitry that generates its picture from signals received from the computer  within the computer  either integral to the motherboard or plugged into it as an expansion card  there is pre processing circuitry to convert the microprocessor s output data to a format compatible with the display unit s circuitry  the images from computer monitors originally contained only text  but as graphical user interfaces emerged and became common  they began to display more images and multimedia content     the term  monitor  is also used  particularly by technicians in broadcasting television  where a picture of the broadcast data is displayed to a highly standardized reference monitor for confidence checking purposes     the video card otherwise called a graphics card  graphics adapter or video adapter processes the graphics output from the motherboard and transmits it to the display  it is an essential part of modern multimedia enriched computing  on older models  and today on budget models  graphics circuitry may be integrated with the motherboard  but for modern and flexible machines  they are connected by the pci  agp  or pci express interface     when the ibm pc was introduced  most existing business oriented personal computers used text only display adapters and had no graphics capability  home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals  but with low resolution by modern standards owing to the limited memory available to the eight bit processors available at the time     a keyboard is an arrangement of buttons that each correspond to a function  letter  or number  they are the primary devices used for inputting text  in most cases  they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters  numbers  and functions printed or engraved on the button  they are generally designed around an operators language  and many different versions for different languages exist     in english  the most common layout is the qwerty layout  which was originally used in typewriters  they have evolved over time  and have been modified for use in computers with the addition of function keys  number keys  arrow keys  and keys specific to an operating system  often  specific functions can be achieved by pressing multiple keys at once or in succession  such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager  programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations  such as refreshing a web page in a web browser or selecting all text in a word processor     a computer mouse is a small handheld device that users hold and slide across a flat surface  pointing at various elements of a graphical user interface with an on screen cursor  and selecting and moving objects using the mouse buttons  almost all modern personal computers include a mouse  it may be plugged into a computer s rear mouse socket  or as a usb device  or  more recently  may be connected wirelessly via an usb dongle or bluetooth link     in the past  mice had a single button that users could press down on the device to  click  on whatever the pointer on the screen was hovering over  modern mice have two  three or more buttons  providing a  right click  function button on the mouse  which performs a secondary action on a selected object  and a scroll wheel  which users can rotate using their fingers to  scroll  up or down  the scroll wheel can also be pressed down  and therefore be used as a third button  some mouse wheels may be tilted from side to side to allow sideways scrolling  different programs make use of these functions differently  and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel  open different menus with different buttons  etc  these functions may be also user defined through software utilities     mice traditionally detected movement and communicated with the computer with an internal  mouse ball   and used optical encoders to detect rotation of the ball and tell the computer where the mouse has moved  however  these systems were subject to low durability  accuracy and required internal cleaning  modern mice use optical technology to directly trace movement of the surface under the mouse and are much more accurate  durable and almost maintenance free  they work on a wider variety of surfaces and can even operate on walls  ceilings or other non horizontal surfaces     all computers require either fixed or removable storage for their operating system  programs and user generated material  early home computers used compact audio cassettes for file storage  these were at the time a very low cost storage solution  but were displaced by floppy disk drives when manufacturing costs dropped  by the mid     s     initially  the      inch and     inch floppy drives were the principal forms of removable storage for backup of user files and distribution of software  as memory sizes increased  the capacity of the floppy did not keep pace  the zip drive and other higher capacity removable media were introduced but never became as prevalent as the floppy drive     by the late     s  the optical drive  in cd and later dvd and blu ray disc forms  became the main method for software distribution  and writeable media provided means for data backup and file interchange  as a result  floppy drives became uncommon in desktop personal computers since about       and were dropped from many laptop systems even earlier note      a second generation of tape recorders was provided when videocassette recorders were pressed into service as backup media for larger disk drives  all these systems were less reliable and slower than purpose built magnetic tape drives  such tape drives were uncommon in consumer type personal computers but were a necessity in business or industrial use     interchange of data such as photographs from digital cameras is greatly expedited by installation of a card reader  which is often compatible with several forms of flash memory devices  it is usually faster and more convenient to move large amounts of data by removing the card from the mobile device  instead of communicating with the mobile device through a usb interface     a usb flash drive performs much of the data transfer and backup functions formerly done with floppy drives  zip disks and other devices  mainstream operating systems for personal computers provide built in support for usb flash drives  allowing interchange even between computers with different processors and operating systems  the compact size and lack of moving parts or dirt sensitive media  combined with low cost and high capacity  have made usb flash drives a popular and useful accessory for any personal computer user     the operating system can be located on any storage  but is typically installed on a hard disk or solid state drive  a live cd represents the concept of running an operating system directly from a cd  while this is slow compared to storing the operating system on a hard disk drive  it is typically used for installation of operating systems  demonstrations  system recovery  or other special purposes  large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard disk drives of similar size  as of mid       but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight  small size and low power requirements     computer communications involve internal modem cards  modems  network adapter cards  and routers  common peripherals and adapter cards include headsets  joysticks  microphones  printers  scanners  sound adapter cards  as a separate card rather than located on the motherboard   speakers and webcams     computer software is any kind of computer program  procedure  or documentation that performs some task on a computer system    the term includes application software such as word processors that perform productive tasks for users  system software such as operating systems that interface with computer hardware to provide the necessary services for application software  and middleware that controls and co ordinates distributed systems     software applications are common for word processing  internet browsing  internet faxing  e mail and other digital messaging  multimedia playback  playing of computer game  and computer programming  the user of a modern personal computer may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs  but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer  therefore  most software written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use  or  user friendliness  in mind  however  the software industry continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers  targeted at both the expert and the non expert user     an operating system  os  manages computer resources and provides programmers with an interface used to access those resources  an operating system processes system data and user input  and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system  an operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory  prioritizing system requests  controlling input and output devices  facilitating computer networking  and managing files     common contemporary desktop operating systems are microsoft windows  os x  linux  solaris and freebsd  windows  os x  and linux all have server and personal variants  with the exception of microsoft windows  the designs of each of the them were inspired by or directly inherited from the unix operating system  which was developed at bell labs beginning in the late     s and spawned the development of numerous free and proprietary operating systems     microsoft windows is the collective brand name of several operating systems made by microsoft  microsoft first introduced an operating environment named windows in november         as an add on to ms dos and in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces  guis      generated by apple s      introduction of the macintosh    the most recent client and server version of windows are windows     and windows server      r   respectively     os x  formerly mac os x  is a line of operating systems developed  marketed  and sold by apple inc   os x is the successor to the original mac os  which had been apple s primary operating system since       os x is a unix based graphical operating system  and snow leopard  leopard  lion  mountain lion  and the new mavericks are version titles  the most recent version of os x is entitled os x yosemite     on iphone  ipad and ipod  versions of ios  which is an os x derivative  are available from ios     to the recent ios       linux is a family of unix like computer operating systems  linux is one of the most prominent examples of free software and open source development  typically all underlying source code can be freely modified  used  and redistributed by anyone    the name  linux  refers to the linux kernel  started in      by linus torvalds  the system s utilities and libraries usually come from the gnu operating system  announced in      by richard stallman  the gnu contribution is the basis for the alternative name gnu linux       known for its use in servers  with the lamp application stack as one of prominent examples  linux is supported by corporations such as dell  hewlett packard  ibm  novell  oracle corporation  red hat  canonical ltd  and sun microsystems  it is used as an operating system for a wide variety of computer hardware  including desktop computers  netbooks  supercomputers    video game systems  such as the playstation    until this option was removed remotely by sony in          several arcade games  and embedded devices such as mobile phones  portable media players  routers  and stage lighting systems     generally  a computer user uses application software to carry out a specific task  system software supports applications and provides common services such as memory management  network connectivity and device drivers  all of which may be used by applications but are not directly of interest to the end user  a simplified analogy in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb  an application  to an electric power generation plant  a system   the power plant merely generates electricity  not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user     typical examples of software applications are word processors  spreadsheets  and media players  multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as an application suite  microsoft office and openoffice org  which bundle together a word processor  a spreadsheet  and several other discrete applications  are typical examples  the separate applications in a suite usually have a user interface that has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application  often  they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user  for example  a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application     end user development tailors systems to meet the user s specific needs  user written software include spreadsheet templates  word processor macros  scientific simulations  graphics and animation scripts  even email filters are a kind of user software  users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is     pc gaming is popular among the high end pc market  gaming platforms like steam  software  and gog com  as well as competitive e sports titles like league of legends  are largely responsibleaccording to whom  for pc systems overtaking console revenue in            toxic chemicals found in computer hardware include lead  mercury  cadmium  chromium  plastic  pvc   and barium  in a raw materials breakdown  computer is about     lead  copper  zinc  mercury  and cadmium      is plastic      is aluminum  and     is iron     lead is found in a cathode ray tube  crt  display  and on all of the printed circuit boards and most expansion cards  mercury is located in the screen s fluorescent lamp  in the laser light generators in the optical disk drive  and in the round  silver looking batteries on the motherboard  plastic is found mostly in the housing of the computation and display circuitry     while daily end users are not exposed to these toxic elements  the danger arises during the computer recycling process  which involves manually breaking down hardware and leads to the exposure of a measurable amount of lead or mercury  a measurable amount of lead or mercury can easily cause serious brain damage or ruin drinking water supplies  computer recycling is best handled by the electronic waste  e waste  industry  and kept segregated from the general community dump     personal computers have become a large contributor to the    million tons of discarded electronic waste that is being generated annually  according to the united nations environment programme  to address the electronic waste issue affecting developing countries and the environment  extended producer responsibility  epr  acts have been implemented in various countries and states       organizations  such as the silicon valley toxics coalition  basel action network  toxics link india  scope  and greenpeace have contributed to these efforts  in the absence of comprehensive national legislation or regulation on the export and import of electronic waste  the silicon valley toxics coalition and ban  basel action network  teamed up with    electronic recyclers in the us and canada to create an e steward program for the orderly disposal of manufacturers and customers electronic waste  the silicon valley toxics coalition founded the electronics takeback coalition  a coalition that advocates for the production of environmentally friendly products  the takeback coalition works with policy makers  recyclers  and smart businesses to get manufacturers to take full responsibility of their products     there are organizations opposing epr regulation  such as the reason foundation  they see flaws in two principal tenants of epr  first epr relies on the idea that if the manufacturers have to pay for environmental harm  they will adapt their practices  second epr assumes the current design practices are environmentally inefficient  the reason foundation claims that manufacturers naturally move toward reduced material and energy use
