 personal cloud is a collection of digital content and services which are accessible from any device  the personal cloud is not a tangible entity  it is a place which gives users the ability to store  synchronize  stream and share content on a relative core  moving from one platform  screen and location to another  created on connected services and applications  it reflects and sets consumers  expectations for how next generation computing services will work      the four primary types of personal cloud in use today are  online cloud  nas device cloud  server device cloud  and home made clouds             the online cloud is also sometimes referred to as public cloud  online cloud is the cloud computing model where online resources like software and data storage are made available over the internet by a service provider  in an online cloud model  cloud services are provided in a virtualized ecosystem  are constructed using pooled  shared physical resources and are accessed by the internet      typically an individual or organization has little control over the ecosystem in which the online cloud is hosted and the core infrastructure is shared between many individuals and organizations  the data and application on the online cloud is logically segregated so that only those authorized are allowed access   some examples of online cloud providers include dropbox  box  funambol  basefolder and google drive     a network attached storage  nas  device is a computer connected to a network that provides only file based data storage services to other devices on the network  although it may technically be possible to run other software on a nas device  it is not designed to be a general purpose server   cloud nas is remote storage that is accessed over the internet as if it was local     a cloud nas is often used for backups and archiving  one of the benefits of nas cloud is that data in the cloud can be accessed at any time from anywhere  the main drawback  however  is that the speed of the transfer rate is only as fast as the network connection the data is accessed over and can therefore be fairly slow   an example of nas personal cloud is the my cloud  by western digital  the cloudbox  by lacie  and the central  by seagate     in many ways cloud servers work in the same way as physical servers but the functions they perform can be very different   typically  the cloud server is an on premise device that is connected to the internet and gives users the functions available on the online cloud but with the added benefit and security of the files being in their control on their premises     the server cloud has been historically enterprise based deployed by businesses needing an in house cloud  however  there are also in house options available for individual users such as the cloudlocker by stoamigo   and the nimbus project       for the more technologically proficient user a common solution for using a personal cloud is to create a home made cloud system by connecting an external usb hard drive to a wi fi router  this enables both wired and wireless computers to access the usb hard drive and use it for storage or for retrieving files a user needs to share on the network   thereby acting like a cloud     the challenge for the home made cloud is that in order to set it up a user has to have a certain degree of skills in technology and network setup  this solution is not for novices and average consumers  if this setup is not done by a tech expert the biggest issue will be security and leaving the files accessible to anyone with technical knowledge    not every router supports this type of access and modification  three of the biggest routers to allow this type of connection are linksys    netgear   and asus
