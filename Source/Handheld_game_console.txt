 a handheld game console is a lightweight  portable video game console with a built in screen  game controls  and speakers   handheld game consoles are smaller than home video game consoles and contain the console  screen  speakers  and controls in one unit  allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place       in       mattel introduced the first handheld electronic game with the release of auto race   later  several companies including coleco and milton bradley made their own single game  lightweight table top or handheld electronic game devices   the oldest true handheld game console with interchangeable cartridges is the milton bradley microvision in           nintendo is credited with popularizing the handheld console concept with the release of the game boy in       and as of      continues to dominate the handheld console market  with their nintendo  ds and  ds systems              the origins of handheld game consoles are found in handheld and tabletop electronic game devices of the     s and early     s  these electronic devices are capable of playing only a single game   they fit in the palm of the hand or on a tabletop  and they may make use of a variety of video displays such as led  vfd  or lcd   in       handheld electronic games were described by popular electronics magazine as  nonvideo electronic games  and  non tv games  as distinct from devices that required use of a television screen    handheld electronic games  in turn  find their origins in the synthesiscitation needed of previous handheld and tabletop electro mechanical devices such as waco s electronic tic tac toe         cragstan s periscope firing range      s     and the emerging optoelectronic display driven calculator market of the early     s      this synthesis happened in       when  mattel began work on a line of calculator sized sports games that became the world s first handheld electronic games  the project began when michael katz  mattel s new product category marketing director  told the engineers in the electronics group to design a game the size of a calculator  using led  light emitting diode  technology        the result was the      release of auto race    followed by football later the same yearcitation needed  the two games were so successful that according to katz   these simple electronic handheld games turned into a       million category     mattel would later win the honor of being recognized by the industry for innovation in handheld game device displays    soon  other manufacturers including coleco  parker brothers  milton bradley  entex  and bandai  began following up with their own tabletop and handheld electronic games     in      the lcd based microvision  designed by smith engineering and distributed by milton bradley    became the first handheld game console and the first to use interchangeable game cartridges   the microvision game cosmic hunter        also introduced the concept of a directional pad on handheld gaming devicescitation needed  and is operated by using the thumb to manipulate the on screen character in any of four directions       in       gunpei yokoi  traveling on a bullet train  saw a bored businessman playing with an lcd calculator by pressing the buttons  yokoi then thought of an idea for a watch that doubled as a miniature game machine for killing time    starting in       nintendo began to release a series of electronic games designed by yokoi called the game   watch games    taking advantage of the technology used in the credit card sized calculators that had appeared on the market  yokoi designed the series of lcd based games to include a digital time display in the corner of the screen    for later  more complicated game   watch games  yokoi invented a cross shaped directional pad or  d pad  for control of on screen characters    yokoi also included his directional pad on the nes controllers  and the cross shaped thumb controller soon became standard on game console controllers and ubiquitous across the video game industry as a replacement for the joystick    when yokoi began designing nintendo s first handheld game console  he came up with a device that married the elements of his game   watch devices and the famicom console    including both items  d pad controller  the result was the nintendo game boy     in       the bandai lcd solarpower was the first solar powered gaming device  some of its games  such as the horror themed game terror house  featured two lcd panels  one stacked on the other  for an early  d effect    in       takara tomy s tomytronic  d simulated  d by having two led panels that were lit by external light through a window on top of the device  making it the first dedicated home video  d hardware       the late     s and early     s saw the beginnings of the handheld game console industry as we know it  after the demise of the microvision  as backlit lcd game consoles with color graphics consume a lot of power  they were not battery friendly like the non backlit original game boy whose monochrome graphics allowed longer battery life  by this point  rechargeable battery technology had not yet matured and so the more advanced game consoles of the time such as the sega game gear and atari lynx did not have nearly as much success as the game boy     even though third party rechargeable batteries were available for the battery hungry alternatives to the game boy  these batteries employed a nickel cadmium process and had to be completely discharged before being recharged to ensure maximum efficiency  lead acid batteries could be used with automobile circuit limiters  cigarette lighter plug devices   but the batteries had mediocre portability  the later nimh batteries  which do not share this requirement for maximum efficiency  were not released until the late     s  years after the game gear  atari lynx  and original game boy had been discontinued  during the time when technologically superior handhelds had strict technical limitations  batteries had a very low mah rating since batteries with heavy power density were not yet available     modern game systems such as the nintendo ds and playstation portable have rechargeable lithium ion batteries with proprietary shapes  other seventh generation consoles such as the gp x use standard alkaline batteries  because the mah rating of alkaline batteries has increased since the     s  the power needed for handhelds like the gp x may be supplied by relatively few batteries     nintendo released the game boy on april           or in september      for uk   the design team headed by gunpei yokoi had also been responsible for the game   watch system  as well as the nintendo entertainment system games metroid and kid icarus  the game boy came under scrutiny by some industry critics  saying that the monochrome screen was too small  and the processing power was inadequate  the design team had felt that low initial cost and battery economy were more important concerns  and when compared to the microvision  the game boy was a huge leap forward     yokoi recognized that the game boy needed a killer app at least one game that would define the console  and persuade customers to buy it  in june       minoru arakawa  then ceo of nintendo of america saw a demonstration of the game tetris at a trade show  nintendo purchased the rights for the game  and packaged it with the game boy system  it was almost an immediate hit  by the end of the year more than a million units were sold in the us    and    million were sold by      verification needed as of march           the game boy and game boy color combined to sell        million units worldwide         in       epyx created the handy game  a device that would turn into the atari lynx in       it was the first color handheld console ever made  as well as the first with a backlit screen  it also featured networking support with up to    other players  and advanced hardware that allowed the zooming and scaling of sprites  the lynx could also be turned upside down to accommodate left handed players  however  all these features came at a very high price point  which drove consumers to seek cheaper alternatives  the lynx was also very unwieldy  consumed batteries very quickly  and lacked the third party support enjoyed by its competitors  due to its high price  short battery life  production shortages  a dearth of compelling games  and nintendo s aggressive marketing campaign  and despite a redesign in       the lynx became a commercial failure  despite this  companies like telegames helped to keep the system alive long past its commercial relevance  and when new owner hasbro released the rights to develop for the public domain  independent developers like songbird have managed to release new commercial games for the system every year until      s winter games     the turboexpress was a portable version of the turbografx  released in      for          the price was briefly raised to          soon dropped back to          and by      it was           its japanese equivalent was the pc engine gt     it was the most advanced handheld of its time and could play all the turbografx    s games  which were on a small  credit card sized media called hucards   it had a   xa mm      in   screen  the same as the original game boy  but in a much higher resolution  and could display    sprites at once     per scanline  in     colors  although the hardware could only handle     simultaneous colors  it had   xa kilobytes of ram  the turbo ran its two      cpus at     xa mhz in parallel     the optional  turbovision  tv tuner included rca audio video input  allowing users to use turboexpress as a video monitor  the  turbolink  allowed two player play  falcon  a flight simulator  included a  head to head  dogfight mode that could only be accessed via turbolink  however  very few tg    games offered co op play modes especially designed with the turboexpress in mind     the bitcorp gamate was the one of the first handheld game systems created in response to the nintendo game boy  it was released in asia in      and distributed worldwide by          like the sega game gear  it was horizontal in orientation and like the game boy  required   aa batteries  unlike many later game boy clones  its internal components were professionally assembled  no  glop top  chips   unfortunately the system s fatal flaw was its screen  even by the standards of the day  its screen was rather difficult to use  suffering from similar motion blur problems that were common complaints with the first generation game boys  likely because of this fact sales were quite poor  and bitcorp closed by       however  new games continued to be published for the asian market  possibly as late as       the total number of games released for the system remains unknown     interestingly  gamate games were designed for stereo sound  but the console was only equipped with a mono speaker  to appreciate the full sound palette  a user must plug into the head phone jack  doing so reveals very sophisticated music     the sega game gear was the third color handheld console  after the lynx and the turboexpress  released in japan in      and in north america and europe in       it was based on the sega master system  which gave sega the ability to quickly create game gear games from its large library of games for the master system  while never reaching the level of success enjoyed by nintendo  the sega game gear proved to be a fairly durable competitor  lasting longer than any other game boy rivals     while the game gear is most frequently seen in black or navy blue  it was also released in a variety of additional colors  red  light blue  yellow  clear  and violet  all of these variations were released in small quantities and frequently only in the asian market     following sega s success with the game gear  they began development on a successor during the early     s  which was intended to feature a touchscreen interface  many years before the nintendo ds  however  such a technology was very expensive at the time  and the handheld itself was estimated to have cost around      were it to be released  sega eventually chose to shelve the idea and instead release the sega nomad  a handheld version of the mega drive  genesis   as the successor       the watara supervision was released in      in an attempt to compete with the nintendo game boy  the first model was designed very much like a game boy  but it was grey in color and had a slightly larger screen  the second model was made with a hinge across the center and could be bent slightly to provide greater comfort for the user  while the system did enjoy a modest degree of success  it never impacted the sales of nintendo or sega  the supervision was redesigned a final time as  the magnum   released in limited quantities it was roughly equivalent to the game boy pocket  it was available in three colors  yellow  green and grey  watara designed many of the games themselves  but did receive some third party support  most notably from sachen     a tv adapter was available in both pal and ntsc formats that could transfer the supervision s black and white palette to   colors  similar in some regards to the super game boy from nintendo     the hartung game master was an obscure handheld released at an unknown point in the early     s  its graphics were much lower than most of its contemporaries  similar in complexity to the atari       it was available in black  white  and purple  and was frequently rebranded by its distributors  such as delplay  videojet and virella     the exact number of games released is not known  but is likely around     the system most frequently turns up in europe and australia     by this time  the lack of significant development in nintendo s product line began allowing more advanced systems such as the neo geo pocket color and the wonderswan color to achieve moderate success     the game com  pronounced in tv commercials as  game com   not  game dot com   and not capitalized in marketing material  was a handheld game console released by tiger electronics in september       it featured many new ideas for handheld consoles and was aimed at an older target audience  sporting pda style features and functions such as a touch screen and stylus  however  tiger hoped it would also challenge nintendo s game boy and gain a following among younger gamers too  unlike other handheld game consoles  the first game com consoles included two slots for game cartridges  which would not happen again until the tapwave zodiac  the ds and ds lite  and could be connected to a      kbit s modem  later models had only a single cartridge slot     the game boy color  also referred to as gbc or cgb  is nintendo s successor to the game boy and was released on october           in japan and in november of the same year in the united states  it features a color screen  and is slightly bigger than the game boy pocket  the processor is twice as fast as a game boy s and has twice as much memory  it also had an infrared communications port for wireless linking which did not appear in later versions of the game boy  such as the game boy advance     the game boy color was a response to pressure from game developers for a new system  as they felt that the game boy  even in its latest incarnation  the game boy pocket  was insufficient  the resulting product was backward compatible  a first for a handheld console system  and leveraged the large library of games and great installed base of the predecessor system  this became a major feature of the game boy line  since it allowed each new launch to begin with a significantly larger library than any of its competitors  as of march           the game boy and game boy color combined to sell        million units worldwide         the console was capable of displaying up to    different colors simultaneously on screen from its palette of         and could add basic four color shading to games that had been developed for the original game boy  it could also give the sprites and backgrounds separate colors  for a total of more than four colors     the neo geo pocket color  or ngpc  was released in      in japan  and later that year in the united states and europe  it was a    bit color handheld game console designed by snk  the maker of the neo geo home console and arcade machine  it came after snk s original neo geo pocket monochrome handheld  which debuted in      in japan     in      following snk s purchase by japanese pachinko manufacturer aruze  the neo geo pocket color was dropped from both the us and european markets  purportedly due to commercial failure citation needed    the system seemed well on its way to being a success in the u s  it was more successful than any game boy competitor since sega s game gear  but was hurt by several factors  such as snk s infamous lack of communication with third party developers  and anticipation of the game boy advance citation needed the decision to ship u s  games in cardboard boxes in a cost cutting move rather than hard plastic cases that japanese and european releases were shipped in may have also hurt us sales citation needed    the wonderswan color is a handheld game console designed by bandai  it was released on december          in japan    and was a moderate success     the original wonderswan had only a black and white screen  although the wonderswan color was slightly larger and heavier   xa mm and  xa g  compared to the original wonderswan  the color version featured    xa kb   of ram and a larger color lcd screen  in addition  the wonderswan color is compatible with the original wonderswan library of games     prior to wonderswan s release  nintendo had virtually a monopoly in the japanese video game handheld market  after the release of the wonderswan color  bandai took approximately    of the market share in japan partly due to its low price of      yen  approximately us           another reason for the wonderswan s success in japan was the fact that bandai managed to get a deal with square to port over the original famicom final fantasy games with improved graphics and controls    however  with the popularity of the game boy advance and the reconciliation between square and nintendo  the wonderswan color and its successor  the swancrystal quickly lost its competitive advantage     the     s saw a major leap in innovation  particularly in the second half with the release of the ds and psp     in       nintendo released the game boy advance  gba or agb   which added two shoulder buttons  a larger screen  and more computing power than the game boy color     the design was revised two years later when the game boy advance sp  gba sp   a more compact version  was released  the sp featured a  clamshell  design  folding open and closed  like a laptop computer   as well as a frontlit color display and rechargeable battery  despite the smaller form factor  the screen remained the same size as that of the original  in       the game boy micro was released  this revision sacrificed screen size and backwards compatibility with previous game boys for a dramatic reduction in total size and a brighter backlit screen  a new sp model with a backlit screen was released in some regions around the same time     along with the nintendo gamecube  the gba also introduced the concept of  connectivity   using a handheld system as a console controller  a handful of games use this feature  most notably animal crossing  pac man vs   final fantasy crystal chronicles  the legend of zelda  four swords adventures  the legend of zelda  the wind waker  metroid prime  and sonic adventure    battle     as of december           the gba  gba sp  and the game boy micro combined have sold       million units worldwide       the original gp   was released in      by the south korean company game park a few months after the launch of the game boy advance  it featured a    bit cpu     xa mhz processor  mp  and divx player  and e book reader  smartmedia cards were used for storage  and could hold up to    mb of anything downloaded through a usb cable from a pc  the gp   was redesigned in       a front lit screen was added and the new version was called gp   flu  front light unit   in summer       another redesign  the gp   blu  was made  and added a backlit screen  this version of the handheld was planned for release outside south korea  in europe  and it was released for example in spain  virginplay was the distributor   while not a commercial success on a level with mainstream handhelds  only        units were sold   it ended up being used mainly as a platform for user made applications and emulators of other systems  being popular with developers and more technically adept users       nokia released the n gage in       it was designed as a combination mp  player  cellphone  pda  radio  and gaming device  the system received much criticism alleging defects in its physical design and layout  including its vertically oriented screen and requirement of removing the battery to change game cartridges  the most well known of these was  sidetalking   or the act of placing the phone speaker and receiver on an edge of the device instead of one of the flat sides  causing the user to appear as if they are speaking into a taco     the n gage qd was later released to address the design flaws of the original  however  certain features available in the original n gage  including mp  playback  fm radio reception  and usb connectivity were removed     second generation of n gage launched on april           in the form of a service for selected nokia smartphones     the cybiko was a russian hand held computer introduced in may      by david yang s company and designed for teens  featuring its own two way radio text messaging system  it had over      official  freeware games and applications  because of the text messaging system  it features a qwerty keyboard that was used with a stylus  an mp  player add on was made for the unit as well as a smartmedia card reader  the company stopped manufacturing the units after two product versions and only a few years on the market  cybikos can communicate with each other up to a maximum range of     metres       miles   several cybikos can chat with each other in a wireless chatroom     cybiko classic     there were two models of the classic cybiko  visually  the only difference was that the original version had a power switch on the side  whilst the updated version used the  escape  key for power management  internally  the differences between the two models were in the internal memory  and the location of the firmware     cybiko xtreme     the cybiko xtreme was the second generation cybiko handheld  it featured various improvements over the original cybiko  such as a faster processor  more ram  more rom  a new operating system  a new keyboard layout and case design  greater wireless range  a microphone  improved audio output  and smaller size     in       tapwave released the zodiac  it was designed to be a pda handheld game console hybrid  it supported photos  movies  music  internet  and documents  the zodiac used a special version palm os       t  that supported the special gaming buttons and graphics chip  two versions were available  zodiac   and    differing in memory and looks  the zodiac line ended in july      when tapwave declared bankruptcy     the nintendo ds was released in november       among its new features were the incorporation of two screens  a touchscreen  wireless connectivity  and a microphone port  as with the game boy advance sp  the ds features a clamshell design  with the two screens aligned vertically on either side of the hinge     the ds s lower screen is touch sensitive  designed to be pressed with a stylus  a user s finger or a special  thumb pad   a small plastic pad attached to the

 nintendo released a larger version of the dsi  called the dsi xl     the gameking was a handheld game console released by the chinese company timetop in       the first model while original in design owes a large debt to nintendo s game boy advance  the second model  the gameking    is believed to be inspired by sony s psp    this model also was upgraded with a backlit screen  with a distracting background transparency  which can be removed by opening up the console   a color model  the gameking   apparently exists  but was only made for a brief time and was difficult to purchase outside of asia  whether intentionally or not  the gameking has the most primitive graphics of any handheld released since the game boy of      citation needed    as many of the games have an  old school  simplicity  the device has developed a small cult following  the gameking s speaker is quite loud and the cartridges  sophisticated looping soundtracks  sampled from other sources  are seemingly at odds with its primitive graphics     timetop made at least one additional device sometimes labeled as  gameking   but while it seems to possess more advanced graphics  is essentially an emulator that plays a handful of multi carts  like the gb station light ii   outside of asia  especially china  however the gameking remains relatively unheard of due to the enduring popularity of japanese handhelds such as those manufactured by nintendo and sony     the playstation portable  officially abbreviated psp    is a handheld game console manufactured and marketed by sony computer
