 commodity computing  or commodity cluster computing  is the use of large numbers of already available computing components for parallel computing to get the greatest amount of useful computation at low cost   it is computing done in commodity computers as opposed to high cost supermicrocomputers or boutique computers  commodity computers are computer systems manufactured by multiple vendors  incorporating components based on open standards  such systems are said to be based on commodity components  since the standardization process promotes lower costs and less differentiation among vendors  products  standardization and decreased differentiation lower the switching or exit cost from any given vendor  increasing purchaser s leverage and preventing lock in  a governing principle of commodity computing is that it is preferable to have more low performance  low cost hardware working in parallel  scalar computing   e g  amd x   cisc   than to have fewer high performance  high cost hardware   e g  ibm power  or sun oracle s sparc  risc   at some point  the number of discrete systems in a cluster will be greater than the mean time between failures  mtbf  for any hardware platform  no matter how reliable  so fault tolerance must be built into the controlling software    purchases should be optimized on cost per unit of performance  not just absolute performance per cpu at any cost             the first computers were large  expensive and proprietary  the move towards commodity computing began when dec introduced the pdp   in       this was a computer that was relatively small and inexpensive enough that a department could purchase one without convening a meeting of the board of directors  the entire minicomputer industry sprang up to supply the demand for  small  computers like the pdp    unfortunately  each of the many different brands of minicomputers had to stand on its own because there was no software and very little hardware compatibility between the brands     when the first general purpose microprocessor was introduced in      it immediately began chipping away at the low end of the computer market  replacing embedded minicomputers in many industrial devices     this process accelerated in      with the introduction of the first commodity like microcomputer  the apple ii  with the development of the visicalc application in       microcomputers broke out of the factory and began entering office suites in large quantities  but still through the back door     the ibm pc was introduced in      and immediately began displacing apple iis in the corporate world  but commodity computing as we know it today truly began when compaq developed the first true ibm pc compatible  more and more pc compatible microcomputers began coming into big companies through the front door and commodity computing was well established     during the     s microcomputers began displacing larger computers in a serious way  at first  price was the key justification but by the late     s and early     s  vlsi semiconductor technology had evolved to the point where microprocessor performance began to eclipse the performance of discrete logic designs  these traditional designs were limited by speed of light delay issues inherent in any cpu larger than a single chip  and performance alone began driving the success of microprocessor based systems     by the mid     s  nearly all computers made were based on microprocessors  and the majority of general purpose microprocessors were implementations of the x   instruction set architecture  although there was a time when every traditional computer manufacturer had its own proprietary micro based designs there are only a few manufacturers of non commodity computer systems today     today  there are fewer and fewer general business computing requirements that cannot be met with off the shelf commodity computers  it is likely that the low end of the supermicrocomputer genre will continue to be pushed upward by increasingly powerful commodity microcomputers
