 natural gas is a fossil fuel formed when layers of buried plants  gases  and animals are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years  the energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in natural gas  natural gas is a nonrenewable resource because it cannot be replenished on a human time frame   natural gas is a hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane  but commonly includes varying amounts of other higher alkanes and sometimes a usually lesser percentage of carbon dioxide  nitrogen  and or hydrogen sulfide   natural gas is an energy source often used for heating  cooking  and electricity generation  it is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals     natural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates  petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found in close proximity to  and with natural gas  most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms  biogenic and thermogenic  biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes  bogs  landfills  and shallow sediments  deeper in the earth  at greater temperature and pressure  thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material       before natural gas can be used as a fuel  it must be processed to remove impurities  including water  to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas  the by products of this processing include  ethane  propane  butanes  pentanes  and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons  hydrogen sulfide  which may be converted into pure sulfur   carbon dioxide  water vapor  and sometimes helium and nitrogen     natural gas is often informally referred to simply as  gas   especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal  however  it is not to be confused with gasoline  especially in north america  where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas     natural gas was used by the chinese in about     bc  they discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil sea water to extract the salt   the world s first industrial extraction of natural gas started at fredonia  new york  usa in        by          trillion cubic meters  or     had been used out of the total     trillion cubic meters of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas   based on an estimated      world consumption rate of about     trillion cubic meters of gas per year  the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last     years at current consumption rates  an annual increase in usage of      could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less  perhaps as few as    to     years              in the   th century  natural gas was usually obtained as a by product of producing oil  since the small  light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface  similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces  unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields  if there was not a market for natural gas near the wellhead it was virtually valueless since it had to be piped to the end user     in the   th century and early   th century  such unwanted gas was usually burned off at oil fields  today  unwanted gas  or stranded gas without a market  associated with oil extraction often is returned to the reservoir with  injection  wells while awaiting a possible future market or to repressurize the formation  which can enhance extraction rates from other wells  in regions with a high natural gas demand  such as the us   pipelines are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an end consumer     in addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation  other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas  lng  or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids  gtl  technologies  gtl technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline  diesel or jet fuel  a variety of gtl technologies have been developed  including fischer tropsch  f t   methanol to gasoline  mtg  and stg   f t produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products  while mtg can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas  stg  can produce drop in gasoline  diesel  jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single loop process   in       royal dutch shell s         barrel per day f t plant went into operation in qatar     natural gas can be  associated   found in oil fields   or  non associated   isolated in natural gas fields   and is also found in coal beds  as coalbed methane     it sometimes contains a significant amount of ethane  propane  butane  and pentane heavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the methane being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock  non hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide  nitrogen  helium  rarely   and hydrogen sulfide must also be removed before the natural gas can be transported       natural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas  whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet  or associated gas  the natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging resource types  sour gas  tight gas  shale gas  and coalbed methane     there is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves  sources that consider that russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the us cia       trillion cubic meters     the us energy information administration       tcm     and opec       tcm     however  bp credits russia with only      tcm    which would place it in second place  slightly behind iran       to      tcm  depending on the source   with gazprom  russia is frequently the world s largest natural gas extractor  major proven resources  in billion cubic meters  are world                 iran                russia                qatar                turkmenistan               and the united states                  it is estimated that there are about     trillion cubic meters of  unconventional  gas such as shale gas  of which     trillion may be recoverable    in turn  many studies from mit  black   veatch and the doe predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future       the world s largest gas field is the offshore south pars   north dome gas condensate field  shared between iran and qatar  it is estimated to have    trillion cubic meters of natural gas and    billion barrels of natural gas condensates     because natural gas is not a pure product  as the reservoir pressure drops when non associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical  pressure temperature  conditions  the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing an effect called retrograde condensation  the liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted  one method to deal with this problem is to re inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re evaporation and extraction of condensates  more frequently  the liquid condenses at the surface  and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate  the resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid  ngl  and has commercial value     shale gas is natural gas produced from shale  because shale has matrix permeability too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities  shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow  early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed  almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by hydraulic fracturing  since       shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the united states and canada    following the success in the united states  shale gas exploration is beginning in countries such as poland  china  and south africa        with the increase of shale production it has caused the united states to become the number one natural gas producer in the world      town gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of coal and contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen  carbon monoxide  methane  and other volatile hydrocarbons  together with small quantities of non calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen  and is used in a similar way to natural gas  this is a historical technology  not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today  but there are still some specific cases where it is the best option and it may be so into the future     most town  gashouses  located in the eastern us in the late   th and early   th centuries were simple by product coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air tight chambers  the gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting   gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the   th century   the coal tar  or asphalt  that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes  and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets     methanogenic archaea are responsible for all biological sources of methane  some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms  including termites  ruminants  and cultivated crops  other sources of methane  the principal component of natural gas  include landfill gas  biogas  and methane hydrate  when methane rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non fossil organic matter  biomass   these are referred to as biogas  or natural biogas   sources of biogas include swamps  marshes  and landfills  see landfill gas   as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure   by way of anaerobic digesters  in addition to enteric fermentation  particularly in cattle  landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites  excluding water vapor  about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide  with small amounts of nitrogen  oxygen  and hydrogen  and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes  if the gas is not removed  the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface  causing damage to the landfill structure  unpleasant odor  vegetation die off  and an explosion hazard  the gas can be vented to the atmosphere  flared or burned to produce electricity or heat  biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills  this method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces  anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure  while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts  like landfill gas  biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide  with small amounts of nitrogen  oxygen and hydrogen  however  with the exception of pesticides  there are usually lower levels of contaminants     landfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than   per cent co   and a few parts per million hn s  because co  and hn s corrode the pipelines    the presence of co  will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline clarification needed siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system  consequently it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline  water vapor is often removed  even if the gas is burned on site  if low temperatures condense water out of the gas  siloxanes can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor  other non methane components may also be removed to meet emission standards  to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations  co firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion  which lowers emissions     biogas  and especially landfill gas  are already used in some areas  but their use could be greatly expanded  experimental systems were being proposedwhen  for use in parts of hertfordshire  uk  and lyon in france citation needed using materials that would otherwise generate no income  or even cost money to get rid of  improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production  gas generated in sewage treatment plants is commonly used to generate electricity  for example  the hyperion sewage plant in los angeles burns  xa million cubic feet         xa m   of gas per day to generate power   new york city utilizes gas to run equipment in the sewage plants  to generate electricity  and in boilers    using sewage gas to make electricity is not limited to large cities  the city of bakersfield  california  uses cogeneration at its sewer plants    california has     sewage wastewater treatment plants     of which have installed anaerobic digesters  the total biopower generation from the    plants is about    mw       huge quantities of natural gas  primarily methane  exist in the form of hydrates under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience permafrost  such as those in siberia  hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form     in       the cost of extracting natural gas from crystallized natural gas was estimated to         per cent the cost of extracting natural gas from conventional sources  and even higher from offshore deposits       in       japan oil  gas and metals national corporation  jogmec  announced that they had recovered commercially relevant quantities of natural gas from methane hydrate       the image below is a schematic block flow diagram of a typical natural gas processing plant  it shows the various unit processes used to convert raw natural gas into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets     the block flow diagram also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur  byproduct ethane  and natural gas liquids  ngl  propane  butanes and natural gasoline  denoted as pentanes                  natural gas flowing in the distribution lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines  these engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission  these compressors are required in the mid stream line to pressurize and to re pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels  the natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a british thermal unit  btu  value between     and     xa btus  the processed natural gas may then be used for residential  commercial and industrial uses     often mid stream and well head gases require removal of many of the various hydrocarbon species contained within the natural gas  some of these gases include heptane  pentane  propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above methane  ch   to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission  typically  natural gas compressors require     to     xa btu per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications     several methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use at the natural gas engine  a few technologies are as follows     natural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of cogeneration  gas turbines and steam turbines  natural gas is also well suited for a combined use in association with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar   and for alimenting peak load power stations functioning in tandem with hydroelectric plants  most grid peaking power plants and some off grid engine generators use natural gas  particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode  natural gas burns more cleanly than other hydrocarbon fuels  such as oil and coal  and produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released  for an equivalent amount of heat  burning natural gas produces about    per cent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about    per cent less than burning coal    the energy information administration reports the following emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide in the world     for      as the official energy statistics of the us government       coal fired electric power generation emits around       pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated  which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by a natural gas fired electric plant per megawatt hour generated  because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation  as the fuel mix in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen  those measured in the first quarter of      were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since            combined cycle power generation using natural gas is currently the cleanest available source of power using hydrocarbon fuels  and this technology is widely and increasingly used as natural gas can be obtained at increasingly reasonable costs  fuel cell technology may eventually provide cleaner options for converting natural gas into electricity  but as yet it is not price competitive  locally produced electricity and heat using natural gas powered combined heat and power plant  chp or cogeneration plant  is considered energy efficient and a rapid way to cut carbon emissions       natural gas dispensed from a simple stovetop can generate temperatures in excess of     xa  c      xa  f  making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel    in much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes  where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens  gas heated clothes dryers  heating cooling  and central heating  heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers  furnaces  and water heaters     compressed natural gas  cng  is used in rural homes without connections to piped in public utility services  or with portable grills citation needed natural gas is also supplied by independent natural gas suppliers through natural gas choice programs throughout the united states  however  as cng costs more than lpg  lpg  propane  is the dominant source of rural gas     cng is a cleaner alternative to other automobile fuels such as gasoline  petrol  and diesel  by the end of      there were       million natural gas vehicles worldwide  led by iran      million   pakistan      million   argentina       million   brazil       million   india      million   and china      million     the energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines  but lower compared with modern diesel engines  gasoline petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines  resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas            cng specific engines  however  use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel s higher octane number of                  natural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia  via the haber process  for use in fertilizer production     russian aircraft manufacturer tupolev is currently running a development program to produce lng  and hydrogen powered aircraft    the program has been running since the mid     s  and seeks to develop lng and hydrogen variants of the tu     and tu     passenger aircraft  and also the tu     cargo aircraft  it claims that at current market prices  an lng powered aircraft would cost       roubles    us            less to operate per ton  roughly equivalent to    per cent  with considerable reductions to carbon monoxide  hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions     the advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency  in effect replacing an intercooler  alternatively  it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust     natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen  with one common method being the hydrogen reformer  hydrogen has many applications  it is a primary feedstock for the chemical industry  a hydrogenating agent  an important commodity for oil refineries  and the fuel source in hydrogen vehicles     natural gas is also used in the manufacture of fabrics  glass  steel  plastics  paint  and other products citation needed    because of its low density  it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle  natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans  many existing pipelines in america are close to reaching their capacity  prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages  in western europe  the gas pipeline network is already dense    new pipelines are planned or under construction in eastern europe and between gas fields in russia  near east and northern africa and western europe  see also list of natural gas pipelines     lng carriers transport liquefied natural gas  lng  across oceans  while tank trucks can carry liquefied or compressed natural gas  cng  over shorter distances  sea transport using cng carrier ships that are now under development may be competitive with lng transport in specific conditions     gas is turned into liquid at a liquefaction plant  and is returned to gas form at regasification plant at the terminal  shipborne regasification equipment is also used  lng is the preferred form for long distance  high volume transportation of natural gas  whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to      xa km       xa mi  over land and approximately half that distance offshore     cng is transported at high pressure  typically above     bars  compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefaction regasification plants  natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end users  or to distribution points such as pipelines     in the past  the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold  and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring  flaring is now illegal in many countries    additionally  higher demand in the last       years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable  as a further option  the gas is now sometimes re injected into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding  conservation  re injection  or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets  pipelines   and regulatory restrictions     a  master gas system  was invented in saudi arabia in the late     s  ending any necessity for flaring  satellite observation  however  shows that flaring   and venting   are still practiced in some gas extracting countries     natural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for desalination  similarly  some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity     natural gas is often stored underground inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells  salt domes  or in tanks as liquefied natural gas  the gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up  storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands  but such storage may not always be practicable     with    countries accounting for    per cent of the worldwide extraction  access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics  and countries vie for control of pipelines    in the first decade of the   st century  gazprom  the state owned energy company in russia  engaged in disputes with ukraine and belarus over the price of natural gas  which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of europe could be cut off for political reasons    the united states is preparing to export natural gas       floating liquefied natural gas  flng  is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped because due to environmental or economic factors it is nonviable to develop them via a land based lng operation  flng technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages     many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of floating liquefied natural gas  flng   however  for the time being  the only flng facility now in development is being built by shell    due for completion around            natural gas is mainly composed of methane  after release to the atmosphere it is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals   oh  formed in the troposphere or stratosphere  giving the overall chemical reaction ch     o   co     h o      while the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide    with a half life of about   years    it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere  so that a given quantity of methane has    times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a    year period and    times over a     year period  natural gas is thus a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide due to the greater global warming potential of methane    current estimates by the epa place global emissions of methane at   xa billion cubic metres        ^  xa cuxa ft  annually    or     per cent of global production    direct emissions of methane represented      per cent of all global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in            during extraction  storage  transportation  and distribution  natural gas is known to leak into the atmosphere  particularly during the extraction process  a cornell university study in      demonstrated that the leak rate of methane may be high enough to jeopardize its global warming advantage over coal    this study was criticized later for its high assumption of methane leakage values    these values were later shown to be close to the findings of the scientists at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration    natural gas extraction also releases an isotope of radon  ranging from   to         becquerels per cubic meter       natural gas is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel  it produces about     and     less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than oil and coal respectively    and potentially fewer pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels    however  in absolute terms  it comprises a substantial percentage of human carbon emissions  and this contribution is projected to grow  according to the ipcc fourth assessment report  in       natural gas produced about     billion tons a year of co  emissions  while coal and oil produced      and      billion tons respectively  according to an updated version of the special report on emissions scenario by       natural gas would be the source of    billion tons a year  with coal and oil now     and      billion respectively because demand is increasing     percent a year     natural gas produces far lower amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides than any other hydrocarbon fuels    the other pollutants due to natural gas combustion are listed below     in parts per million  ppm      in mines  where methane seeping from rock formations has no odor  sensors are used  and mining apparatus such as the davy lamp has been specifically developed to avoid ignition sources     some gas fields yield sour gas containing hydrogen sulfide  h s   this untreated gas is toxic  amine gas treating  an industrial scale process which removes acidic gaseous components  is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas       extraction of natural gas  or oil  leads to decrease in pressure in the reservoir  such decrease in pressure in turn may result in subsidence  sinking of the ground above  subsidence may affect ecosystems  waterways  sewer and water supply systems  foundations  and so on     another ecosystem effect results from the noise of the process  this can change the composition of animal life in the area  and have consequences for plants as well in that animals disperse seeds and pollen citation needed    releasing the gas from low permeability reservoirs is accomplished by a process called hydraulic fracturing or  hydrofracking   to allow the natural gas to flow out of the shale  oil operators force   to  xa million us gallons        xa m   of water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the shale  the high pressure water breaks up or  fracks  the shale  which releases the trapped gas  sand is added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the shale open  thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface  the chemicals are added to the frack fluid to reduce friction and combat corrosion  during the extracting life of a gas well  other low concentrations of other chemical substances may be used  such as biocides to eliminate fouling

odor masking  when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another  as of       the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking       explosions caused by natural gas leaks occur a few times each year  individual homes  small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure  frequently  the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing  in these cases  the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries  occasionally  the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion  disintegrating one or more buildings in the process  the gas usually dissipates readily outdoors  but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough  however  considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel  the individual risk of using natural gas is very low     natural gas heating systems are a minor source of carbon
