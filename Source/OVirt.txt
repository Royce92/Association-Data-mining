 ovirt is a free platform virtualization management web application community project started by red hat  ovirt is built on libvirt which could allow it to manage virtual machines hosted on any supported backend  including kvm  xen and virtualbox  however  ovirt is currently focused on kvm alone  ovirt is open source software with backing from red hat and it is the base for red hat enterprise virtualization     ovirt can manage multiple hosts  it communicates with its host servers over https with xml rpc  via an agent that is installed on the server   vdsmd  virtual desktops and servers manager daemon   vdsm communicates with libvirt to control the virtual machines life cycle     ovirt  via vdsmd  can use locally attached storage and or networked storage solutions such as nfs and iscsi as well as fibre channel  it is incapable of supporting aoe  glusterfs distributed file system  red hat storage server  is supported from the ovirt     release as well as other posixfs compliant file systems  such as ibm s gpfs      ovirt  via vdsmd  also configures the hosts  networking configuration   link aggregation  vlans  mtu settings  source routing to accomplish multiple gateways  and openstack neutron integration     ovirt has   web based front ends   for administrators  users and power users  for self provisioning   it also has a rest based api  a python sdk and a cli interface  which allows automation of most of its features     ovirt is written in java  over wildfly  the former jboss  application server and gwt web framework for its user interface  vdsmd is written in python     ovirt supports and ships    bit vdsmd binary on following supported hosts    novirt supports the spice communications protocol for remote desktop sharing and similar use cases
