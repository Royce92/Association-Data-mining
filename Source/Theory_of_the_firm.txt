 the theory of the firm consists of a number of economic theories that explain and predict the nature of the firm  company  or corporation  including its existence  behavior  structure  and relationship to the market              in simplified terms  the theory of the firm aims to answer these questions     firms exist as an alternative system to the market price mechanism when it is more efficient to produce in a non market environment  for example  in a labor market  it might be very difficult or costly for firms or organizations to engage in production when they have to hire and fire their workers depending on demand supply conditions  it might also be costly for employees to shift companies every day looking for better alternatives  similarly  it may be costly for companies to find new suppliers daily  thus  firms engage in a long term contract with their employees or a long term contract with suppliers to minimize the cost or maximize the value of property rights        the first world war period saw a change of emphasis in economic theory away from industry level analysis which mainly included analyzing markets to analysis at the level of the firm  as it became increasingly clear that perfect competition was no longer an adequate model of how firms behaved  economic theory until then had focused on trying to understand markets alone and there had been little study on understanding why firms or organisations exist  markets are guided by prices and quality as illustrated by vegetable markets where a buyer is free to switch sellers in an exchange     the need for a revised theory of the firm was emphasized by empirical studies by adolf berle and gardiner means  who made it clear that ownership of a typical american corporation is spread over a wide number of shareholders  leaving control in the hands of managers who own very little equity themselves   r xa l  hall and charles j  hitch found that executives made decisions by rule of thumb rather than in the marginalist way      according to ronald coase  people begin to organise their production in firms when the transaction cost of coordinating production through the market exchange  given imperfect information  is greater than within the firm      ronald coase set out his transaction cost theory of the firm in       making it one of the first  neo classical  attempts to define the firm theoretically in relation to the market   one aspect of its  neoclassicism  lies in presenting an explanation of the firm consistent with constant returns to scale  rather than relying on increasing returns to scale   another is in defining a firm in a manner which is both realistic and compatible with the idea of substitution at the margin  so instruments of conventional economic analysis apply  he notes that a firm s interactions with the market may not be under its control  for instance because of sales taxes   but its internal allocation of resources are   within a firm    market transactions are eliminated and in place of the complicated market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the entrepreneur   who directs production   he asks why alternative methods of production  such as the price mechanism and economic planning   could not either achieve all production  so that either firms use internal prices for all their production  or one big firm runs the entire economy     coase begins from the standpoint that markets could in theory carry out all production  and that what needs to be explained is the existence of the firm  with its  distinguishing mark   of the supersession of the price mechanism   coase identifies some reasons why firms might arise  and dismisses each as unimportant     instead  for coase the main reason to establish a firm is to avoid some of the transaction costs of using the price mechanism  these include discovering relevant prices  which can be reduced but not eliminated by purchasing this information through specialists   as well as the costs of negotiating and writing enforceable contracts for each transaction  which can be large if there is uncertainty   moreover  contracts in an uncertain world will necessarily be incomplete and have to be frequently re negotiated  the costs of haggling about division of surplus  particularly if there is asymmetric information and asset specificity  may be considerable     if a firm operated internally under the market system  many contracts would be required  for instance  even for procuring a pen or delivering a presentation   in contrast  a real firm has very few  though much more complex  contracts  such as defining a manager s power of direction over employees  in exchange for which the employee is paid  these kinds of contracts are drawn up in situations of uncertainty  in particular for relationships which last long periods of time  such a situation runs counter to neo classical economic theory  the neo classical market is instantaneous  forbidding the development of extended agent principal  employee manager  relationships  of planning  and of trust  coase concludes that  a firm is likely therefore to emerge in those cases where a very short term contract would be unsatisfactory   and that  it seems improbable that a firm would emerge without the existence of uncertainty      he notes that government measures relating to the market  sales taxes  rationing  price controls  tend to increase the size of firms  since firms internally would not be subject to such transaction costs  thus  coase defines the firm as  the system of relationships which comes into existence when the direction of resources is dependent on the entrepreneur   we can therefore think of a firm as getting larger or smaller based on whether the entrepreneur organises more or fewer transactions     the question then arises of what determines the size of the firm  why does the entrepreneur organise the transactions he does  why no more or less  since the reason for the firm s being is to have lower costs than the market  the upper limit on the firm s size is set by costs rising to the point where internalising an additional transaction equals the cost of making that transaction in the market   at the lower limit  the firm s costs exceed the market s costs  and it does not come into existence   in practice  diminishing returns to management contribute most to raising the costs of organising a large firm  particularly in large firms with many different plants and differing internal transactions  such as a conglomerate   or if the relevant prices change frequently     coase concludes by saying that the size of the firm is dependent on the costs of using the price mechanism  and on the costs of organisation of other entrepreneurs  these two factors together determine how many products a firm produces and how much of each      according to louis putterman  most economists accept distinction between intra firm and interfirm transaction but also that the two shade into each other  the extent of a firm is not simply defined by its capital stock    george barclay richardson for example  notes that a rigid distinction fails because of the existence of intermediate forms between firm and market such as inter firm co operation       klein        asserts that  economists now recognise that such a sharp distinction does not exist and that it is useful to consider also transactions occurring within the firm as representing market  contractual  relationships   the costs involved in such transactions that are within a firm or even between the firms are the transaction costs     ultimately  whether the firm constitutes a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces or simply  a legal fiction    a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals   as jensen and meckling put it  is  a function of the completeness of markets and the ability of market forces to penetrate intra firm relationships        it was only in the     s that the neo classical theory of the firm was seriously challenged by alternatives such as managerial and behavioral theories  managerial theories of the firm  as developed by william baumol       and        robin marris        and oliver e  williamson         suggest that managers would seek to maximise their own utility and consider the implications of this for firm behavior in contrast to the profit maximising case   baumol suggested that managers  interests are best served by maximising sales after achieving a minimum level of profit which satisfies shareholders   more recently this has developed into  principal agent  analysis  e g   spence and zeckhauser   and ross       citation needed on problems of contracting with asymmetric information  which models a widely applicable case where a principal  a shareholder or firm for example  cannot costlessly infer how an agent  a manager or supplier  say  is behaving  this may arise either because the agent has greater expertise or knowledge than the principal  or because the principal cannot directly observe the agent s actions  it is asymmetric information which leads to a problem of moral hazard  this means that to an extent managers can pursue their own interests  traditional managerial models typically assume that managers  instead of maximising profit  maximise a simple objective utility function  this may include salary  perks  security  power  prestige  subject to an arbitrarily given profit constraint  profit satisficing      the behavioural approach  as developed in particular by richard cyert and james g  march of the carnegie school places emphasis on explaining how decisions are taken within the firm  and goes well beyond neoclassical economics    much of this depended on herbert a  simon s work in the     s concerning behaviour in situations of uncertainty  which argued that  people possess limited cognitive ability and so can exercise only  bounded rationality  when making decisions in complex  uncertain situations   thus individuals and groups tend to  satisfice  that is  to attempt to attain realistic goals  rather than maximize a utility or profit function  cyert and march argued that the firm cannot be regarded as a monolith  because different individuals and groups within it have their own aspirations and conflicting interests  and that firm behaviour is the weighted outcome of these conflicts  organisational mechanisms  such as  satisficing  and sequential decision taking  exist to maintain conflict at levels that are not unacceptably detrimental  compared to ideal state of productive efficiency  there is organisational slack  leibenstein s x inefficiency      armen alchian and harold demsetz s analysis of team production is an extension and clarification of earlier work by coase    thus according to them the firm emerges because extra output is provided by team production  but that the success of this depends on being able to manage the team so that metering problems  it is costly to measure the marginal outputs of the co operating inputs for reward purposes  and attendant shirking  the moral hazard problem  can be overcome  by estimating marginal productivity by observing or specifying input behaviour  such monitoring as is therefore necessary  however  can only be encouraged effectively if the monitor is the recipient of the activity s residual income  otherwise the monitor herself would have to be monitored  ad infinitum   for alchian and demsetz  the firm therefore is an entity which brings together a team which is more productive working together than at arm s length through the market  because of informational problems associated with monitoring of effort  in effect  therefore  this is a  principal agent  theory  since it is asymmetric information within the firm which alchian and demsetz emphasise must be overcome  in barzel        s theory of the firm  drawing on jensen and meckling         the firm emerges as a means of centralising monitoring and thereby avoiding costly redundancy in that function  since in a firm the responsibility for monitoring can be centralised in a way that it cannot if production is organised as a group of workers each acting as a firm  citation needed    the weakness in alchian and demsetz s argument  according to williamson  is that their concept of team production has quite a narrow range of application  as it assumes outputs cannot be related to individual inputs  in practice this may have limited applicability  small work group activities  the largest perhaps a symphony orchestra   since most outputs within a firm  such as manufacturing and secretarial work  are separable  so that individual inputs can be rewarded on the basis of outputs  hence team production cannot offer the explanation of why firms  in particular  large multi plant and multi product firms  exist     for oliver e  williamson  the existence of firms derives from  asset specificity  in production  where assets are specific to each other such that their value is much less in a second best use    this causes problems if the assets are owned by different firms  such as purchaser and supplier   because it will lead to protracted bargaining concerning the gains from trade  because both agents are likely to become locked into a position where they are no longer competing with a  possibly large  number of agents in the entire market  and the incentives are no longer there to represent their positions honestly  large numbers bargaining is transformed into small number bargaining     if the transaction is a recurring or lengthy one  re negotiation may be necessary as a continual power struggle takes place concerning the gains from trade  further increasing the transaction costs  moreover there are likely to be situations where a purchaser may require a particular  firm specific investment of a supplier which would be profitable for both  but after the investment has been made it becomes a sunk cost and the purchaser can attempt to re negotiate the contract such that the supplier may make a loss on the investment  this is the hold up problem  which occurs when either party asymmetrically incurs substantial costs or benefits before being paid for or paying for them   in this kind of a situation  the most efficient way to overcome the continual conflict of interest between the two agents  or coalitions of agents  may be the removal of one of them from the equation by takeover or merger  asset specificity can also apply to some extent to both physical and human capital  so that the hold up problem can also occur with labour  e g  labour can threaten a strike  because of the lack of good alternative human capital  but equally the firm can threaten to fire      probably the best constraint on such opportunism is reputation  rather than the law  because of the difficulty of negotiating  writing and enforcement of contracts   if a reputation for opportunism significantly damages an agent s dealings in the future  this alters the incentives to be opportunistic       williamson sees the limit on the size of the firm as being given partly by costs of delegation  as a firm s size increase its hierarchical bureaucracy does too   and the large firm s increasing inability to replicate the high powered incentives of the residual income of an owner entrepreneur  this is partly because it is in the nature of a large firm that its existence is more secure and less dependent on the actions of any one individual  increasing the incentives to shirk   and because intervention rights from the centre characteristic of a firm tend to be accompanied by some form of income insurance to compensate for the lesser responsibility  thereby diluting incentives  milgrom and roberts        explain the increased cost of management as due to the incentives of employees to provide false information beneficial to themselves  resulting in costs to managers of filtering information  and often the making of decisions without full information citation needed this grows worse with firm size and more layers in the hierarchy  empirical analyses of transaction costs have attempted to measure and operationalize transaction costs      research that attempts to measure transaction costs is the most critical limit to efforts to potential falsification and validation of transaction cost economics     the theory of the firm considers what bounds the size and output variety of firms  this includes how firms may be able to combine labour and capital so as to lower the average cost of output  either from increasing  decreasing  or constant returns to scale for one product line or from economies of scope for more than one product line          efficiency wage models like that of shapiro and stiglitz        suggest wage rents as an addition to monitoring  since this gives employees an incentive not to shirk  given a certain probability of detection and the consequence of being fired citation needed williamson  wachter and harris        suggest promotion incentives within the firm as an alternative to morale damaging monitoring  where promotion is based on objectively measurable performance citation needed  the difference between these two approaches may be that the former is applicable to a blue collar environment  the latter to a white collar one   leibenstein        sees a firm s norms or conventions  dependent on its history of management initiatives  labour relations and other factors  as determining the firm s  culture  of effort  thus affecting the firm s productivity and hence size citation needed    george akerlof        develops a gift exchange model of reciprocity  in which employers offer wages unrelated to variations in output and above the market level  and workers have developed a concern for each other s welfare  such that all put in effort above the minimum required  but the more able workers are not rewarded for their extra productivity  again  size here depends not on rationality or efficiency but on social factors citation needed in sum  the limit to the firm s size is given where costs rise to the point where the market can undertake some transactions more efficiently than the firm     recently  yochai benkler further questioned the rigid distinction between firms and markets based on the increasing salience of  commons based peer production  systems such as open source software  e
