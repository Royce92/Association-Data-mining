 a futures exchange or futures market is a central financial exchange where people can trade standardized futures contracts  that is  a contract to buy specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future  these types of contracts fall into the category of derivatives  such instruments are priced according to the movement of the underlying asset  stock  physical commodity  index  etc    the aforementioned category is named  derivatives  because the value of these instruments are derived from another asset class              according to the new palgrave dictionary of economics  newbery        futures markets  provide partial income risk insurance to producers whose output is risky  but very effective insurance to commodity stockholders at remarkably low cost  speculators absorb some of the risk but hedging appears to drive most commodity markets  the equilibrium futures price can be either below or above the  rationally  expected future price  backwardation or contango    rollover hedges can extend insurance from short horizon contracts over longer periods       one of the earliest written records of futures trading is in aristotle s politics  he tells the story of thales  a poor philosopher from miletus who developed a  financial device  which involves a principle of universal application   thales used his skill in forecasting and predicted that the olive harvest would be exceptionally good the next autumn  confident in his prediction  he made agreements with local olive press owners to deposit his money with them to guarantee him exclusive use of their olive presses when the harvest was ready  thales successfully negotiated low prices because the harvest was in the future and no one knew whether the harvest would be plentiful or pathetic and because the olive press owners were willing to hedge against the possibility of a poor yield  when the harvest time came  and a sharp increase in demand for the use of the olive presses outstripped supply  availability of the presses   he sold his future use contracts of the olive presses at a rate of his choosing  and made a large quantity of money   it should be noted  however  that this is a very loose example of futures trading and  in fact  more closely resembles an option contract  given that thales was not obliged to use the olive presses if the yield was poor     the first modern organized futures exchange began in      at the dojima rice exchange in osaka  japan      the london metal market and exchange company  london metal exchange  was founded in       but the market traces its origins back to      and the opening of the royal exchange  london  before the exchange was created  business was conducted by traders in london coffee houses using a makeshift ring drawn in chalk on the floor   at first only copper was traded  lead and zinc were soon added but only gained official trading status in       the exchange was closed during world war ii and did not re open until        the range of metals traded was extended to include aluminium         nickel         tin         aluminium alloy         steel         and minor metals cobalt and molybdenum         the exchange ceased trading plastics in       the total value of the trade is around  us      trillion annually      the united states followed in the early   th century  chicago has the largest future exchange in the world  the chicago mercantile exchange  chicago is located at the base of the great lakes  close to the farmlands and cattle country of the midwest  making it a natural center for transportation  distribution  and trading of agricultural produce  gluts and shortages of these products caused chaotic fluctuations in price  and this led to the development of a market enabling grain merchants  processors  and agriculture companies to trade in  to arrive  or  cash forward  contracts to insulate them from the risk of adverse price change and enable them to hedge  in march      the chicago mercantile exchange announced its acquisition of nymex holdings xa inc   the parent company of the new york mercantile exchange and commodity exchange  cme s acquisition of nymex was completed in august          for most exchanges  forward contracts were standard at the time  however  most forward contracts were not honored by both the buyer and the seller  for instance  if the buyer of a corn forward contract made an agreement to buy corn  and at the time of delivery the price of corn differed dramatically from the original contract price  either the buyer or the seller would back out  additionally  the forward contracts market was very illiquid and an exchange was needed that would bring together a market to find potential buyers and sellers of a commodity instead of making people bear the burden of finding a buyer or seller     in      the chicago board of trade  cbot  was formed  trading was originally in forward contracts  the first contract  on corn  was written on march           in      standardized futures contracts were introduced     the chicago produce exchange was established in       renamed the chicago butter and egg board in      and then reorganised into the chicago mercantile exchange  cme  in       following the end of the postwar international gold standard  in      the cme formed a division called the international monetary market  imm  to offer futures contracts in foreign currencies  british pound  canadian dollar  german mark  japanese yen  mexican peso  and swiss franc     in      a regional market was founded in minneapolis  minnesota  and in      introduced futures for the first time  trading continuously since then  today the minneapolis grain exchange  mgex  is the only exchange for hard red spring wheat futures and options      the     s saw the development of the financial futures contracts  which allowed trading in the future value of interest rates  these  in particular the    day eurodollar contract introduced in       had an enormous impact on the development of the interest rate swap market     today  the futures markets have far outgrown their agricultural origins  with the addition of the new york mercantile exchange  nymex  the trading and hedging of financial products using futures dwarfs the traditional commodity markets  and plays a major role in the global financial system  trading over     xa trillion per day in           the recent history of these exchanges  aug       finds the chicago mercantile exchange trading more than     of its futures contracts on its  globex  trading platform and this trend is rising daily  it counts for over      xa billion of nominal trade  over  xa million contracts  every single day in  electronic trading  as opposed to open outcry trading of futures  options and derivatives     in june      intercontinentalexchange  ice  acquired the international petroleum exchange  ipe   now ice futures  which operated europe s leading open outcry energy futures exchange  since      ice has partnered with the chicago climate exchange  ccx  to host its electronic marketplace  in april      the entire ice portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic     in       the africa mercantile exchange  afmx   became the first african commodities market to implement an automated system for the dissemination of market data and information online in real time through a wide network of computer terminals  as at the end of       afmx  had developed a system of secure data storage providing online services for brokerage firms  the year       saw the exchange unveil a novel system of electronic trading  known as after   after  extends the potential volume of processing of information and allows the exchange to increase its overall volume of trading activities     in      the new york stock exchange teamed up with the amsterdam brussels lisbon paris exchanges  euronext  electronic exchange to form the first transcontinental futures and options exchange  these two developments as well as the sharp growth of internet futures trading platforms developed by a number of trading companies clearly points to a race to total internet trading of futures and options in the coming years original research     in terms of trading volume  the national stock exchange of india in mumbai is the largest stock futures trading exchange in the world  followed by jsexa limited in sandton  gauteng  south africa      exchange traded contracts are standardized by the exchanges where they trade  the contract details what asset is to be bought or sold  and how  when  where and in what quantity it is to be delivered  the terms also specify the currency in which the contract will trade  minimum tick value  and the last trading day and expiry or delivery month  standardized commodity futures contracts may also contain provisions for adjusting the contracted price based on deviations from the  standard  commodity  for example  a contract might specify delivery of heavier usda number   oats at par value but permit delivery of number   oats for a certain seller s penalty per bushel     before the market opens on the first day of trading a new futures contract  there is a specification but no actual contracts exist  futures contracts are not issued like other securities  but are  created  whenever open interest increases  that is  when one party first buys  goes long  a contract from another party  who goes short   contracts are also  destroyed  in the opposite manner whenever open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their short positions     speculators on futures price fluctuations who do not intend to make or take ultimate delivery must take care to  zero their positions  prior to the contract s expiry  after expiry  each contract will be settled  either by physical delivery  typically for commodity underlyings  or by a cash settlement  typically for financial underlyings   the contracts ultimately are not between the original buyer and the original seller  but between the holders at expiry and the exchange  because a contract may pass through many hands after it is created by its initial purchase and sale  or even be liquidated  settling parties do not know with whom they have ultimately traded     compare this with other securities  in which there is a primary market when an issuer issues the security  and a secondary market where the security is later traded independently of the issuer  legally  the security represents an obligation of the issuer rather than the buyer and seller  even if the issuer buys back some securities  they still exist  only if they are legally cancelled can they disappear     the contracts traded on futures exchanges are always standardized  in principle  the parameters to define a contract are endless  see for instance in futures contract   to make sure liquidity is high  there is only a limited number of standardized contracts     most large derivatives exchanges operate their own clearing houses  allowing them to take revenues from post trade processing as well as trading itself  by netting off the different positions traded  a smaller amount of capital is required as security to cover the trades  of the big derivatives venues chicago mercantile exchange  ice and eurex all clear trades themselves  there is sometimes a division of responsibility between provision of trading facility  and that of clearing and settlement of those trades  derivative exchanges like the cboe and liffe take responsibility for providing the trading environments  settlement of the resulting trades are usually handled by clearing houses that serve as central counterparties to trades done in the respective exchanges  the options clearing corporation  occ  and lch clearnet  london clearing house  respectively are the clearing corporations for cboe and liffe  although liffe and parent nyse euronext has long stated its desire to develop its own clearing service     derivative contracts are leveraged positions whose value is volatile  they are usually more volatile than their underlying asset  this can lead to credit risk  in particular counterparty risk  a situation in which one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation  in a safe trading environment  the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade  no matter how the market has moved  this requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty  thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility  to prevent this  a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade  in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended  this action is called novation  as a result  trading firms take no risk on the actual counterparty to the trade  but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central counterparty clearing  the clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process       a margin is collateral that the holder of a financial instrument has to deposit to cover some or all of the credit risk of their counterparty  in this case the central counterparty clearing houses  clearing houses charge two types of margins  the initial margin and the mark to market margin  also referred to as variation margin      the initial margin is the sum of money  or collateral  to be deposited by a firm to the clearing corporation to cover possible future loss in the positions  the set of positions held is also called the portfolio  held by a firm  several popular methods are used to compute initial margins  they include the cme owned span  a grid simulation method used by the cme and about    other exchanges   stans  a monte carlo simulation based methodology used by the occ   tims  earlier used by the occ  and still being used by a few other exchanges      the mark to market margin  mtm margin  on the other hand is the margin collected to offset losses  if any  that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm  this is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market value of that position  if the resulting amount is a loss  the amount is collected from the firm  else  the amount may be returned to the firm  the case with most clearing houses  or kept in reserve depending on local practice  in either case  the positions are  marked to market  by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference  the positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked to market daily and the mtm difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation     clients hold a margin account with the exchange  and every day the swings in the value of their positions is added to or deducted from their margin account  if the margin account gets too low  they have to replenish it  in this way it is highly unlikely that the client will not be able to fulfill his obligations arising from the contracts  as the clearing house is the counterparty to all their trades  they only have to have one margin account  this is in contrast with otc derivatives  where issues such as margin accounts have to be negotiated with all counterparties     each exchange is normally regulated by a national governmental  or semi governmental  regulatory agency
