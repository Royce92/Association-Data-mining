 os x  pronounced   o   s  t n   originally mac os x  is a series of unix based graphical interface operating systems developed and marketed by apple inc  it is designed to run on macintosh computers  having been pre installed on all macs since       it was the successor to mac os    released in       the final release of the  classic  mac os  which had been apple s primary operating system since       the first version released was mac os x server     in       and a desktop version  mac os x v      cheetah  followed on march           previous releases of os x were named after big cats  for example  os x v     was referred to as  mountain lion   however  with the announcement of os x mavericks in june       this was dropped in favor of californian landmarks    within the market of desktop  laptop and home computers  and by web usage  os x is the second most widely used os after windows           os x  whose x is the roman numeral for    and is a prominent part of its brand identity  is built on technologies developed at next between the second half of the     s and apple s purchase of the company in late       the  x  is also used to emphasize the relatedness between os x and unix  unix    certification has been achieved for versions      for intel cpus   and versions      through             ios  the mobile os for the iphone  ipod touch    ipad  and the  nd and  rd generation apple tv    shares the unix based darwin core and many frameworks with os x  an unnamed variant of v     powers the first generation apple tv       the first releases of mac os x from      to      can run only on the powerpc based macs of the period  after apple announced it would shift to using intel x   cpus from      onwards  tiger and leopard were released in versions for intel and powerpc processors  snow leopard is the first version released only for intel macs  since the release of mac os x       lion   os x has dropped support for    bit intel processors as well  it now runs exclusively on    bit intel cpus     apple offers an application suite for os x called os x server  for use on servers  it includes tools to facilitate management of workgroups of os x machines  and to provide network services  it is sold separately through the mac app store as a single item  it remained available until      preinstalled on dedicated server computers  before the release of mac os x       lion   a separate edition of mac os x  called mac os x server  with additional tools bundled with the operating system was sold and was preinstalled on servers     the latest version of os x is        yosemite   which was released to the public on october                      the heritage of what would become os x had originated at next  a company founded by steve jobs following his departure from apple in       there  the unix like nextstep operating system was developed  and then launched in       the kernel of nextstep is based upon the mach kernel  which was originally developed at carnegie mellon university  with additional kernel layers and low level user space code derived from select parts of bsd  its graphical user interface was built on top of an object oriented gui toolkit using the objective c programming language     throughout the early     s  apple had tried to create a  next generation  os through the taligent  copland and gershwin projects  although these were eventually abandoned    this led apple to purchase next in       allowing nextstep  then called openstep  to serve as the basis for apple s next generation os    this purchase also led to steve jobs returning to apple as interim ceo  and later ceo  shepherding the transformation of the programmer friendly openstep into a system that would be adopted by apple s primary market of home users and creative professionals  the project was first code named  rhapsody  and then officially named  mac os x        mac os x was launched for powerpc based macs  in       the first intel macs had a specialized version of       tiger   in             leopard  was the first to run on both powerpc and intel macs with the use of universal binaries        snow leopard  was the first version of os x to drop support for powerpc macs citation needed    mac os x server   x is incompatible with software designed for the original mac os and has no support for apple s own ieee       firewire  interface  mac os x    x includes more backward compatibility through classic and more functionality by introducing the carbon api as well as firewire support  as the operating system evolved  it moved away from the legacy mac os to an emphasis on new  digital lifestyle  applications such as the ilife suite  enhanced business applications  iwork   and integrated home entertainment  the front row media center     each version also included modifications to the general interface  such as the brushed metal appearance added in version       the non pinstriped titlebar appearance in version       and in      the removal of the previous brushed metal styles in favor of the  unified  gradient window style         in       with the release of os x       the  mac  prefix was officially dropped in all references to the operating system name within its web site       os x is the tenth major version of apple s operating system for macintosh computers  previous macintosh operating systems were named using arabic numerals  e g  mac os   and mac os    the letter x in os x s name refers to the number     a roman numeral  it is therefore correctly pronounced  ten    t n  in this context      however  a common mispronunciation is  x     ks        os x s core is a posix compliant operating system  os  built on top of the xnu kernel  with standard unix facilities available from the command line interface  apple has released this family of software as a free and open source operating system named darwin  on top of darwin  apple layered a number of components  including the aqua interface and the finder  to complete the gui based operating system which is os x       os x introduced a number of new capabilities to provide a more stable and reliable platform than its predecessor  mac os    for example  pre emptive multitasking and memory protection improved the system s ability to run multiple applications simultaneously without them interrupting or corrupting each other    many aspects of os x s architecture are derived from openstep  which was designed to be portable  to ease the transition from one platform to another  for example  nextstep was ported from the original   k based next workstations to x   and other architectures before next was purchased by apple    and openstep was later ported to the powerpc architecture as part of the rhapsody project     the most visible change was the aqua theme  the use of soft edges  translucent colors  and pinstripes similar to the hardware design of the first imacs brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what os   and os x server     s  platinum  appearance had offered  according to john siracusa  an editor of ars technica  the introduction of aqua and its departure from the then conventional look  hit like a ton of bricks     bruce tognazzini  who founded the original apple human interface group  said that the aqua interface in mac os x v     represented a step backwards in usability compared with the original mac os interface      third party developers started producing skins for customizable applications and other operating systems which mimicked the aqua appearance  to some extent  apple has used the successful transition to this new design as leverage  at various times threatening legal action against people who make or distribute software with an interface the company says is derived from its copyrighted design       the architecture of os x incorporates a layered design    the layered frameworks aid rapid development of applications by providing existing code for common tasks       os x includes its own software development tools  most prominently an integrated development environment called xcode  xcode provides interfaces to compilers that support several programming languages including c  c    objective c  and java  for the apple intel transition  it was modified so that developers could build their applications as a universal binary  which provides compatibility with both the intel based and powerpc based macintosh lines    first and third party applications can be controlled programatically using the applescript framework  retained from classic mac os  or using the newer automator application citation needed    the darwin sub system in mac os x is in charge of managing the filesystem  which includes the unix permissions layer  in      and       two macworld editors expressed criticism of the permission scheme  ted landau called misconfigured permissions  the most common frustration  in mac os x  while rob griffiths suggested that some users may even have to reset permissions every day  a process which can take up to    minutes    more recently  another macworld editor  dan frakes  called the procedure of repairing permissions vastly overused    he argues that os x typically handles permissions properly without user interference  and resetting permissions should just be tried when problems emerge       mac applications may be installed by the user from any source  or from the mac app store  a marketplace of software maintained by apple  all app store applications run within a  sandbox   restricting their ability to communicate with other programs or modify the core operating system  this provides increased user security but restricts the features they can offer     as of september       os x is the second most active general purpose client operating system in use on the world wide web   after microsoft windows   with an       usage share according to statistics compiled by w counter    it is the most successful unix like desktop operating system on the web  estimated at over   times the usage of linux  which has             there are twenty two  system languages  available for the user at the moment of installation  the  system language  is the entire operating system environment   as of mac os x lion  the languages are arabic  chinese  simplified   chinese  traditional   czech  danish  dutch  english  finnish  french  german  hebrew  hungarian  italian  japanese  korean  norwegian  polish  portuguese  brazilian   portuguese  european   russian  spanish  swedish and turkish  input methods for typing in dozens of scripts can be chosen independently of the system language       the apis that os x inherited from openstep are not backward compatible with earlier versions of mac os  these apis were created as the result of a      collaboration between next computer and sun microsystems and are now referred to by apple as cocoa  this heritage is highly visible for cocoa developers  since the  ns  prefix is ubiquitous in the framework  standing variously for nextstep or next sun  the official openstep api  published in september       was the first to split the api between foundation and application kit and the first to use the  ns  prefix    apple s rhapsody project would have required all new development to use these apis  causing much outcry among existing mac developers  all mac software that did not receive a complete rewrite to the new framework would run in the equivalent of the classic environment  to permit a smooth transition from mac os   to  mac  os x  the carbon application programming interface  api  was created  applications written with carbon can be executed natively on both systems  carbon was not included in the first product sold as  mac os x   mac os x server  now referred to as mac os x server   x  citation needed    os x also used to support the java platform as a  preferred software package  in practice this means that applications written in java fit as neatly into the operating system as possible while still being cross platform compatible  and that graphical user interfaces written in swing look almost exactly like native cocoa interfaces  traditionally  cocoa programs have been mostly written in objective c  with java as an alternative  however  on july           apple announced that  features added to cocoa in mac os x versions later than      will not be added to the cocoa java programming interface        since os x is posix compliant  many software packages written for the  bsds  linux  or other unix like systems can be recompiled to run on it  projects such as homebrew  fink  macports and pkgsrc provide pre compiled or pre formatted packages  from version      to version       os x included x   app  apple s version of the x window system graphical interface for unix applications  as an optional component during installation    up to and including mac os x v      tiger   apple s implementation was based on the x   licensed xfree       and x  r     all bundled versions of x   feature a window manager which is similar to the os x look and feel and has fairly good integration with mac os x  also using the native quartz rendering system  earlier versions of os x  in which x   has not been bundled  can also run x   applications using xdarwin  with the introduction of version      apple switched to the x org variant of x      version mac os x       lion  uses x org server version      x   starting with os x mountain lion  x   is not bundled in os x  instead  it has to be installed from  for example  the open source xquartz project       for the early releases of mac os x  the standard hardware platform supported was the full line of macintosh computers  laptop  desktop  or server  based on powerpc g   g   and g  processors  later versions discontinued support for some older hardware  for example  panther does not support  beige  g s    and tiger does not support systems that pre date apple s introduction of integrated firewire ports  the ports themselves are not a functional requirement   mac os x v      leopard   introduced october       has dropped support for all powerpc g  processors and for powerpc g  processors with clock rates below    xa mhz  mac os x v      snow leopard  supports macs with intel processors  not powerpc  mac os x       lion  requires a mac with an intel core   duo or newer processor citation needed    tools such as xpostfacto and patches applied to the installation disc have been developed by third parties to enable installation of newer versions of mac os x on systems not officially supported by apple  this includes a number of pre g  power macintosh systems that can be made to run up to and including mac os x      jaguar  all g  based macs which can run up to and including tiger  and sub    xa mhz g  macs can run leopard by removing the restriction from the installation dvd or entering a command in the mac s open firmware interface to tell the leopard installer that it has a clock rate of    xa mhz or greater  except for features requiring specific hardware  e g  graphics acceleration  dvd writing   the operating system offers the same functionality on all supported hardware citation needed    powerpc versions of mac os x prior to leopard retain compatibility with older mac os applications by providing an emulation environment called classic  which allows users to run mac os   as a process within mac os x  so that most older applications run as they would under the older operating system  classic is not supported on intel based macs or in mac os x v      leopard   but users still requiring classic applications on intel macs can use the sheepshaver emulator to run mac os   on top of leopard citation needed    in april       eweek announced a rumor that apple had a version of mac os x code named marklar  which ran on intel x   processors  the idea behind marklar was to keep mac os x running on an alternative platform should apple become dissatisfied with the progress of the powerpc platform    these rumors subsided until late in may       when various media outlets  such as the wall street journal   and cnet    announced that apple would unveil marklar in the coming months     on june          steve jobs confirmed these rumors when he announced in his keynote address at the annual apple worldwide developers conference that apple would be making the transition from powerpc to intel processors over the following two years  and that mac os x would support both platforms during the transition  jobs also confirmed rumors that apple had versions of mac os x running on intel processors for most of its developmental life  the last time that apple switched cpu families from the motorola   k cpu to the ibm motorola powerpc apple included a motorola   k emulator in the new os that made almost all   k software work automatically on the new hardware  apple had supported the   k emulator for    years  but stopped supporting it during the transition to intel cpus  included in the new os for the intel based macs is rosetta  a binary translation layer which enables software compiled for powerpc mac os x to run on intel mac os x machines  apple dropped support for classic mode on the new intel macs  third party emulation software such as mini vmac  basilisk ii and sheepshaver provides support for some early versions of mac os  a new version of xcode and the underlying command line compilers support building universal binaries that will run on either architecture       powerpc only software is supported with rosetta  though applications may have to be rewritten to run properly on the newer os x for intel  apple initially encouraged developers to produce universal binaries with support for both powerpc and x      there is a performance penalty when powerpc binaries run on intel macs through rosetta  moreover  some powerpc software  such as kernel extensions and system preferences plugins  are not supported on intel macs  some powerpc applications would not run on intel os x at all  plugins for safari need to be compiled for the same platform as safari  so when safari is running on intel it requires plug ins that have been compiled as intel only or universal binaries  so powerpc only plug ins will not work    while intel macs are able to run powerpc  x    and universal binaries  powerpc macs support only universal and powerpc builds citation needed    support for the powerpc platform was dropped after mac os x       such cross platform capability already existed in mac os x s lineage  openstep was ported to many architectures  including x    and darwin included support for both powerpc and x    apple stated that mac os x would not run on intel based personal computers aside from its own  but a hacked version of the os compatible with conventional x   hardware was developed by the osx   community       on june          apple announced at its worldwide developers conference that snow leopard  version       would drop support for powerpc processors and be intel only    however  rosetta is still available in snow leopard  it is not installed by default  but it is available on the installation dvd as an installable add on and is installed automatically via the internet when first attempting to run a powerpc based application citation needed    on all versions from  and including  lion  rosetta is no longer available citation needed    one of the major differences between the previous versions of mac os and os x was the addition of the aqua gui  a graphical user interface with water like elements  every window element  text  graphic  or widget is drawn on screen using spatial anti aliasing technology    colorsync  a technology introduced many years before  was improved and built into the core drawing engine  to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals    also  drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements to provide a sense of depth  new interface elements were integrated  including sheets  document modal dialog boxes attached to specific windows  and drawers citation needed    apple has continued to change aspects of the os x appearance and design  particularly with tweaks to the appearance of windows and the menu bar  one example of a ui behavioral change is that previewed video and audio files no longer have progress bars in column view  instead  they have mouse over start and stop buttons as of      citation needed    the human interface guidelines published by apple for mac os x are followed by many applications  giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts    in addition  new services for applications are included  which include spelling and grammar checkers  special characters palette  color picker  font chooser and dictionary  these global features are present in every cocoa application  adding consistency  the graphics system opengl composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware accelerated drawing  this technology  introduced in version       is called quartz extreme  a component of quartz  quartz s internal imaging model correlates well with the portable document format  pdf  imaging model  making it easy to output pdf to multiple devices    as a side result  pdf viewing and creating pdf documents from any application are built in features       in version       apple added expos   a feature which includes three functions to help accessibility between windows and desktop  its functions are to instantly display all open windows as thumbnails for easy navigation to different tasks  display all open windows as thumbnails from the current application  and hide all windows to access the desktop    also  filevault was introduced  which is an optional encryption of the user s files with advanced encryption standard  aes            features introduced in version      include automator  an application designed to create an automatic workflow for different tasks    dashboard  a full screen group of small applications called desktop widgets that can be called up and dismissed in one keystroke    and front row  a media viewer interface accessed by the apple remote    moreover  the sync services were included  which is a system that allows applications to access a centralized extensible database for various elements of user data  including calendar and contact items  the operating system then managed conflicting edits and data consistency       as of version       all system icons are scalable up to         pixels  to accommodate various places where they appear in larger size  including for example the cover flow view  a three dimensional graphical user interface included with itunes  the finder  and other apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork  this version includes spaces  a virtual desktop implementation which enables the user to have more than one desktop and display them in an expos  like interface    mac os x v     includes an automatic backup technology called time machine  which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data    and screen sharing was built in for the first time       finder is a file browser allowing quick access to all areas of the computer  which has been modified throughout subsequent releases of mac os x      quick look is part of mac os x leopard s finder  it allows for dynamic previews of files  including videos and multi page documents  without opening their parent applications  spotlight search technology  which is integrated into the finder since mac os x tiger  allows rapid real time searches of data files  mail messages  photos  and other information based on item properties  meta data  and or content      mac os x makes use of a dock  which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows     with the exception of mac os x server     and the original public beta  os x versions were named after big cats until version       when apple switched to using california locations  prior to its release  version      was code named  cheetah  internally at apple  and version      was code named internally as  puma   after the immense buzz surrounding version       codenamed  jaguar   apple s product marketing began openly using the code names to promote the operating system       was marketed as  panther        as  tiger        as  leopard        as  snow leopard        as  lion        as  mountain lion   and      as  mavericks    panther    tiger  and  leopard  are registered as trademarks of apple  but  cheetah    puma  and  jaguar  have never been registered  apple has also registered  lynx  and  cougar  as trademarks  though these were allowed to lapse    computer retailer tiger direct sued apple for its use of the name  tiger   on may          a us federal court in the southern district of florida ruled that apple s use did not infringe on tiger direct s trademark       on september          apple released a           preview  version of mac os x  internally codenamed kodiak  in order to gain feedback from users     the  pb  as it was known marked the first public availability of the aqua interface and apple made many changes to the ui based on customer feedback  mac os x public beta expired and ceased to function in spring            on march           apple released mac os x v      internally codenamed cheetah     the initial version was slow  incomplete  and had very few applications available at the time of its launch  mostly from independent developers  while many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption  they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve  simply releasing mac os x was received by the macintosh community as a great accomplishment  for attempts to completely overhaul the mac os had been underway since       and delayed by countless setbacks  following some bug fixes  kernel panics became much less frequent citation needed    later that year on september           mac os x v      internally codenamed puma  was released  it featured increased performance and provided missing features  such as dvd playback  apple released      as a free upgrade cd for      users  in addition to the us     boxed version for people running mac os    it was discovered that the upgrade cds were full install cds that could be used with mac os   systems by removing a specific file  apple later re released the cds in an actual stripped down format that did not facilitate installation on such systems    on january          apple announced that mac os x was to be the default operating system for all macintosh products by the end of that month       on august             apple followed up with mac os x v      jaguar   the first release to use its code name as part of the branding    it brought great raw performance improvements  a sleeker look  and many powerful user interface enhancements  over      according to apple      including quartz extreme for compositing graphics directly on an ati radeon or nvidia geforce  mx agp based video card with at least    mb of vram  a system wide repository for contact information in the new address book  and an instant messaging client named ichat    the happy mac which had appeared during the mac os startup sequence for almost    years was replaced with a large grey apple logo with the introduction of mac os x v         mac os x v      panther  was released on october           in addition to providing much improved performance  it also incorporated the most extensive update yet to the user interface  panther included as many or more new features as jaguar had the year before  including an updated finder  incorporating a brushed metal interface  fast user switching  expos   window manager   filevault  safari  ichat av  which added videoconferencing features to ichat   improved portable document format  pdf  rendering and much greater microsoft windows interoperability    support for some early g  computers such as  beige  power macs and  wallstreet  powerbooks was discontinued citation needed    mac os x v      tiger  was released on april           apple stated that tiger contained more than     new features    as with panther  certain older machines were no longer supported  tiger requires a mac with    mb and a built in firewire port    among the new features  tiger introduced spotlight  dashboard  smart folders  updated mail program with smart mailboxes  quicktime    safari    automator  voiceover  core image and core video  the initial release of the apple tv used a modified version of tiger with a different graphical interface and fewer applications and services  on january           apple released the first intel based macs along with the        update to tiger  this operating system functioned identically on the powerpc based macs and the new intel based machines  with the exception of the intel release dropping support for the classic environment       mac os x v      leopard  was released on october           it was called by apple  the largest update of mac os x   it brought more than     new features     leopard supports both powerpc  and intel x   based macintosh computers  support for the g  processor was dropped and the g  processor required a minimum clock rate of    xa mhz  and at least     mb of ram to be installed  the single dvd works for all supported macs  including    bit machines   new features include a new look  an updated finder  time machine  spaces  boot camp pre installed     full support for    bit applications  including graphical applications   new features in mail and ichat  and a number of new security features  leopard is an open brand unix    registered product on the intel platform  it was also the first bsd based os to receive unix    certification      leopard dropped support for the classic environment and all classic applications     it was the final version of mac os x to support the powerpc architecture     mac os x v      snow leopard  was released on august           rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of mac os x  snow leopard focused on  under the hood  changes  increasing the performance  efficiency  and stability of the operating system  for most users  the most noticeable changes were  the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to mac os x      leopard  a more responsive finder rewritten in cocoa  faster time machine backups  more reliable and user friendly disk ejects  a more powerful version of the preview application  as well as a faster safari web browser  snow leopard only supported machines with intel cpus  required at least   gb of ram  and dropped default support for applications built for the powerpc architecture  rosetta could be installed as an additional component to retain support for powerpc only applications         mac os x v     also featured new    bit technology capable of supporting greater amounts of ram  improved support for multi core processors through grand central dispatch  and advanced gpu performance with opencl citation needed    an update introduced support for the mac app store  apple s digital distribution platform for os x applications        mac os x v      lion  was released on july           it brought developments made in apple s ios  such as an easily navigable display of installed applications  launchpad  and a greater use of multi touch gestures  to the mac  this release removed rosetta  making it incapable of running powerpc applications citation needed    changes made to the gui  graphical user interface  include the launchpad  similar to the home screen of ios devices   auto hiding scrollbars that only appear when they are being used  and mission control  which unifies expos   spaces  dashboard  and full screen applications within a single interface     apple also made changes to applications  they resume in the same state as they were before they were closed  similar to ios   documents auto save by default citation needed    os x v      mountain lion  was released on july             it incorporates some features seen in ios    which include game center  support for imessage in the new messages messaging application  and reminders as a to do list app separate from ical  which is renamed as calendar  like the ios app   it also includes support for storing iwork documents in icloud     notification center  which makes its debut in mountain lion  is a desktop version similar to the one in ios     and higher  application pop ups are now concentrated on the corner of the screen  and the center itself is pulled from the right side of the screen  mountain lion also includes more chinese features including support for baidu as an option for safari search engine  qq      com and     com services for mail  contacts and calendar  youku  tudou and sina weibo are integrated into share sheets        starting with mountain lion apple software updates  including the os  are distributed via the app store  this updating mechanism replaced the apple software update utility     os x       mavericks  was released on october           this is a free upgrade to all users running os x snow leopard or later  its changes include the addition of the previously ios only maps and ibooks applications  improvements to the notification center  enhancements to several applications  and many under the hood improvements        os x        yosemite  was released on october           apple s showcase new feature in yosemite is handoff  which enables users with iphones running ios     or later to answer phone calls  receive and send sms messages  and complete unfinished iphone emails on their mac     os x can be updated using the mac app store  until os x mountain lion  the updating method was to use the apple software update     software update is a software tool by apple inc  that installs the latest version of apple software on
