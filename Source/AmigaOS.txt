 amigaos is the proprietary native operating system of the amiga personal computer  it was developed first by commodore international and introduced with the launch of the first amiga  the amiga       in       early versions of amigaos required the motorola       series of    bit and    bit microprocessors  later versions were developed by haage   partner  amigaos     and      and then hyperion entertainment  amigaos           a powerpc microprocessor is required for the most recent release  amigaos       amigaos is a single user operating system based on a preemptive multitasking kernel  called exec  it includes an abstraction of the amiga s hardware  a disk operating system called amigados  a windowing system api called intuition and a desktop file manager called workbench     the amiga intellectual property is fragmented between amiga inc   cloanto and hyperion entertainment  the copyrights for works created up to      are owned by cloanto    in      amiga inc  contracted amigaos   development to hyperion entertainment and in      they granted hyperion an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to amigaos     in order to develop and market amigaos   and subsequent versions              amigaos is a single user operating system based on a preemptive multitasking kernel  called exec  amigaos provides an abstraction of the amiga s hardware  a disk operating system called amigados  a windowing system api called intuition and a desktop file manager called workbench  a command line interface  cli   called amigashell  is also integrated into the system  though it also is entirely window based  the cli and workbench components share the same privileges  notably  amigaos lacks any built in memory protection     amigaos is formed from two parts  namely  a firmware component called kickstart and a software portion usually referred to as workbench  up until amigaos      matching versions of kickstart and workbench were typically released together  however  since amigaos      the first release after commodore s demise  only the software component has been updated and the role of kickstart has been diminished somewhat  firmware updates may still be applied by patching at system boot     kickstart is the bootstrap firmware  usually stored in rom  kickstart contains the code needed to boot standard amiga hardware and many of the core components of amigaos  the function of kickstart is comparable to the bios plus the main operating system kernel in ibm pc compatibles  however  kickstart provides more functionality available at boot time than would be typically expected on pc  for example  the full windowing environment     kickstart contains many core parts of the amiga s operating system  such as exec  intuition  the core of amigados and functionality to initialize autoconfig compliant expansion hardware  later versions of the kickstart contained drivers for ide and scsi controllers  pc card ports and other built in hardware     upon start up or reset the kickstart performs a number of diagnostic and system checks and then initializes the amiga chipset and some core os components  it will then examine connected boot devices and attempt to boot from the one with the highest boot priority  if no boot device is present a screen will be displayed asking the user to insert a boot disk  typically a floppy disk     at start up kickstart attempts to boot from a bootable device  typically  a floppy disk or hard disk drive   in the case of a floppy the system reads the first two sectors of the disk  the bootblock   and executes any boot instructions stored there  normally this code passes control back to the os  invoking amigados and the gui  and using the disk as the system boot volume  any such disk  no matter what the other contents of the disk  was referred to as a  boot disk  or  bootable disk   a bootblock could be added to a blank disk by use of the  install  command  some entertainment software contained custom bootblocks  this allowed an application  game or demo to take control of memory and resources  effectively disabling amigaos     the bootblock became an obvious target for virus writers  some games or demos that used a custom bootblock would not work if infected with a bootblock virus  as the code of the virus replaced the original  the first such virus was the sca virus  anti virus attempts included custom bootblocks  these amended bootblock advertised the presence of the virus checker while checking the system for tell tale signs of memory resident viruses and then passed control back to the system  unfortunately these could not be used on disks that already relied on a custom bootblock  but did alert users of potential trouble  several of them also replicated themselves across other disks  becoming little more than viruses in their own right citation needed    exec is the multi tasking kernel of amigaos  exec provides functionality for multi tasking  memory allocation  interrupt handling and handling of dynamic shared libraries  it acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system  providing pre emptive multitasking with prioritized round robin scheduling  exec also provides access to other libraries and high level inter process communication via message passing  other comparable microkernels have had performance problems because of the need to copy messages between address spaces  since the amiga has only one address space  exec message passing is quite efficient       amigados provides the disk operating system portion of the amigaos  this includes file systems  file and directory manipulation  the command line interface  file redirection  console windows  and so on  its interfaces offer facilities such as command redirection  piping  scripting with structured programming primitives  and a system of global and local variables     in amigaos   x  the amigados portion was based on tripos  which is written in bcpl  interfacing with it from other languages proved a difficult and error prone task  and the port of tripos was not very efficient     from amigaos   x onwards  amigados was rewritten in c and assembler  retaining full   x bcpl program compatibility  and it incorporated parts of the third party amigados resource project   which had already written replacements for many of the bcpl utilities and interfaces     arp also provided one of the first standardized file requesters for the amiga  and introduced the use of more friendly unix style wildcard  globbing  functions in command line parameters  other innovations were an improvement in the range of date formats accepted by commands and the facility to make a command resident  so that it only needs to be loaded into memory once and remains in memory to reduce the cost of loading in subsequent uses     in amigaos      the dos abandoned the bcpl legacy completely  and starting from amigaos      it has been rewritten with full    bit support     file extensions are often used in amigaos  but they are not mandatory and they are not handled specially by the dos  being instead just a conventional part of the file names  executable programs are recognized using a magic number     the native amiga windowing system is called intuition  which handles input from the keyboard and mouse and rendering of screens  windows and basic widgets  however  until amigaos     there was no standardized look and feel  and often application developers had to write their own non standard widgets  both buttons and menus   with intuition providing minimal support     an unusual feature of amigaos is the use of multiple screens  these screens are conceptually similar to x window system virtual desktops or workspaces  but can be generated dynamically by application programs  each screen may have a different resolution and color depth  amigaos     also added support for public screens  instead of the workbench screen being the only shareable screen  applications could create their own named screens to share with other applications  a public screen aware application could request a specific public screen by its name with the lockpubscreen   system call  and if such a screen was found  the resulting handle could be passed to the openwindowtaglist   system call  and the application would open its window on the specified public screen  this allowed developers to even write applications that allowed the user to specify in which screen they would open their windows      a gadget in the top right corner of the screen allows screens to be cycled  screens can be overlaid by dragging each up or down by their title bars  as the os stores all screens in memory simultaneously  redrawing is instantaneous  on early amigas this functionality is provided by the custom chipset  but since amigaos  a new hardware assisted technique has been adopted and the screens are draggable in any direction  it is possible to drag and drop icons between screens     each screen has its own rastport handle  just as windows do  this allows applications to draw graphics directly onto the screen instead of being limited to their own window     intuition provided some basic widgets  with amigaos     intuition was enhanced with gadtools and the boopsi object oriented widget system  amigaos     an later   which both provided standard widget sets  and the amiga user interface style guide  which explained how applications should be laid out for consistency  later amigaos provided an enhanced widget set through reaction  amigaos     and later   stefan stuntz created a popular third party widget library  based on boopsi  called magic user interface  mui  which became the official widget toolkit in morphos  while aros implements an mui clone called zune     workbench is the native graphical file manager and desktop environment of amigaos  though the term workbench was originally used to refer to the entire operating system  with the release of amigaos     the operating system was renamed amigaos and subsequently workbench refers to the desktop manager only  as the name suggests  the metaphor of a workbench is used  rather than that of a desktop  directories are depicted as drawers  executable files are tools  data files are projects and gui widgets are gadgets  in many other aspects the interface resembles mac os  with the main desktop showing icons of inserted disks and hard drive partitions  and a single menu bar at the top of every screen  unlike the macintosh mouse available at the time  the standard amiga mouse has two buttons   the right mouse button operates the pull down menus  with a  release to select  mechanism  underlying workbench is the intuition windowing system  which handles screens  windows  gadgets and input from the keyboard and mouse  the workbench environment is not actually required to launch applications and in practice many software titles  particularly games  boot directly from kickstart  using a custom bootblock  in order retain full access to memory and resources     until the release of version    amigaos only natively supported the native amiga graphics chipset  via graphics library  which provides an api for geometric primitives  raster graphic operations and handling of sprites  as this api could be bypassed  some developers chose to avoid os functionality for rendering and directly program the underlying hardware for gains in efficiency     third party graphics cards were initially supported via proprietary unofficial solutions  a later solution where amigaos could directly support any graphics system  was termed retargetable graphics  rtg    with amigaos      some rtg systems were bundled with the os  allowing the use of common hardware cards other than the native amiga chipsets  the main rtg systems are cybergraphx  picasso    and egs  some vector graphic libraries  like cairo and anti grain geometry are also available  modern systems can use cross platform sdl  simple directmedia layer  engine for games and other multimedia programs     the amiga did not have any in built  d graphics capability  and so had no standard  d graphics api  later  graphics card manufacturers and third party developers provided their own standards  which include minigl  warp d  stormmesa  agl library  and cybergl     the amiga was launched at a time when there was little support for  d graphics libraries to enhance desktop guis and computer rendering capabilities  however  the amiga became one of the first widespread  d development platforms  videoscape  d was one of the earliest  d rendering and animation systems  and silver turbosilver was one of the first ray tracing  d programs  then amiga boasted many influential applications in  d software  such as imagine  maxon s cinema  d  realsoft  d  vistapro  aladdin  d and newtek s lightwave  used to render movies and television shows like babylon        likewise  while the amiga is well known for its ability to easily genlock with video  it has no built in video capture interface  the amiga supported a vast number of third party interfaces for video capture from american and european manufacturers  there were internal and external hardware solutions  called frame grabbers  for capturing individual or sequences of video frames  including  newtronic videon  newtek digiview   graffiti external    bit framebuffer  the digilab  the videocruncher  firecracker     vidi amiga     vidi amiga    bit and   rt  real time   newtek video toaster  gvp impact vision iv    macrosystem vlab motion and vlab par  dps par  personal animation recorder   vhi  video hardware interface  by iospirit gmbh  dve     etc  some solutions were hardware plug ins for amiga graphic cards like the merlin xcalibur module  or the dv module built for the amiga clone draco from the german firm macrosystem  modern pci bus tv expansion cards and their capture interfaces are supported through tv library by elbox computer and tvcard library by guido mersmann     following modern trends in evolution of graphical interfaces amigaos     uses  d hardware accelerated porter duff image composition engine     prior to version      amigaos only officially supported the amiga s native sound chip  via audio device  this facilitates playback of sound samples on four dma driven   bit pcm sound channels  the only supported hardware sample format is signed linear   bit two s complement     support for third party audio cards was vendor dependent  until the creation and adoption of ahi   as a de facto standard  ahi offers improved functionality  such as  seamless audio playback from a user selected audio device  standardized functionality for audio recording and efficient software mixing routines for combining multiple sound channels thus overcoming the four channel hardware limit of the original amiga chipset  ahi can be installed separately on amigaos v    and later       amigaos itself did not support midi until     when roger dannenberg s camd library was adapted as the standard midi api  commodore s version of camd library also included a built in driver for the serial port  the later open source version of camd library by kjetil matheussen did not provide a built in driver for the serial port  but provided an external driver instead     amigaos was one of the first operating systems to feature speech synthesis with software developed by softvoice  inc   which allowed text to speech conversion of american english    this had three main components  narrator device  which modulates the phonemes used in american english  translator library  which translates english text to american english phonemes using a set of rules  and a high level speak  handler  which allows command line users to redirect text output to speech  a utility called say was included with the os  which allowed text to speech synthesis with some control of voice and speech parameters  a demo was also included with amigabasic programming examples  speech synthesis was occasionally used in third party programs  particularly educational software  for example  the word processors prowrite and excellence  could read out documents using the synthesizer  these speech synthesis components remained largely unchanged in later os releases and commodore eventually removed speech synthesis support from amigaos     onward because of licensing restrictions       despite the american english limitation of the narrator device s phonemes  francesco devitt developed an unofficial version with multilingual speech synthesis  this made use of an enhanced version of the translator library which could translate a number of language to phonemes  given a set of rules for each language       the amigaos has a dynamically sized ram disk  which resizes itself automatically to its contents  starting with amigaos   x  operating system configuration files were loaded into the ram disk on boot  greatly speeding operating system usage  other files could be copied to the ram disk like any standard device for quick modification and retrieval  also beginning in amigaos   x  the ram disk supported file change notification  which was mostly used to monitor configuration files for changes     later versions of the amigaos also has support for a fixed capacity recoverable ram disk  which functions as a standard ram disk  but can maintain its contents on soft restart  it is commonly called the rad disk  and it can be used as a boot disk  with boot sector   previously  a recoverable ram disk  commonly called the asdg rrd or vd  was introduced in        at first locked to asdg expansion memory products  later the asdg rrd was added to the fred fish series of freeware  shareware and public domain software  disks      and            the amigaos has support for the rexx language  called arexx  short for  amiga rexx    and is a script language which allows for full os scripting  similar to applescript  intra application scripting  similar to vba in microsoft office  as well as inter program communication  having a single scripting language for any application on the operating system is beneficial to users  instead of having to learn a new language for each application     programs can listen on an  arexx port  for string messages  these messages can then be interpreted by the program in a similar fashion to a user pushing buttons  for example  an arexx script run in an e mail program could save the currently displayed email  invoke an external program which could extract and process information  and then invoke a viewer program  this allows applications to control other applications by sending data back and forth directly with memory handles instead of saving files to disk and then reloading     john c  dvorak stated in          the amigaos  remains one of the great operating systems of the past    years  incorporating a small kernel and tremendous multitasking capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in os   and windows nt  the biggest difference is that the amigaos could operate fully and multitask in as little as     k of address space  even today  the os is only about  mb in size  and to this day  there is very little a memory hogging cd rom loading os can do the amiga can t  tight code   there s nothing like it     i ve had an amiga for maybe a decade  it s the single most reliable piece of equipment i ve ever owned  it s amazing  you can easily understand why so many fanatics are out there wondering why they are alone in their love of the thing  the amiga continues to inspire a vibrant   albeit cultlike   community  not unlike that which you have with linux  the unix clone        amigaos provides a modular set of system functions through dynamically loaded shared libraries  either stored as a file on disk with a   library  filename extension  or stored in the kickstart firmware  all library functions are accessed via an indirect jump table  which is a negative offset to the library base pointer  that way  every library function can be patched or hooked at run time  even if the library is stored in rom  the core library of amigaos is the exec library  exec   which provides an interface to functions of the amiga s microkernel     device drivers are also libraries  but they implement a standardized interface  applications do not usually call devices directly as libraries  but use the exec library i o functions to indirectly access them  like libraries  devices are either files on disk  with the   device  extension   or stored in the kickstart rom     the higher level part of device and resource management is controlled by handlers  which are not libraries  but tasks  and communicate by passing messages  one type of handler is a filesystem handler  the amigaos can make use of any filesystem for which a handler has been written  a possibility that has been exploited by programs like crossdos and by a few  alternative  file systems to the standard ofs and ffs  these file systems allow one to add new features like journaling or file privileges  which are not found in the standard operating system  handlers typically expose a device name to the dos  which can be used to access the peripheral  if any  associated with the handler  as an example of these concepts is the speak  handler which could have text redirected to spoken speech  through the speech synthesis system     device names are case insensitive  uppercase by convention  strings followed by a colon  after the colon a specifier can be added  which gives the handler additional information about what is being accessed and how  in the case of filesystem  the specifier usually consists of a path to a file in the filesystem  for other handlers  specifiers usually set characteristics of the desired input output channel  for the ser  serial port driver  for example  the specifier will contain bit rate  start and stop bits  etc    filesystems expose drive names as their device names  for example  df   by default refers to the first floppy drive in the system  on many systems dh   is used to refer to the first hard drive  filesystems also expose volume names  following the same syntax as device names  these identify the specific medium in the file system managed drive  if df   contains a disk named  workbench   then workbench  will be a volume name that can be used to access files in df    if one wanted to access a file named  amp  located in directory  win  of the disk with name  work  in drive df    one could write  df  win amp  or  work win amp   however  these are not completely equivalent  since when the latter form is used  the system knows that the wanted volume is  work  and not just any volume in df    therefore  whenever a requested file on  work  is being accessed without volume  work  being present in any drive  it will say something to the effect of  please insert volume work in any drive     programs often need to access files without knowing their physical location  either the drive or the volume   they only know the  logical path  of the file  i e  whether the file is a library  a documentation file  a translation of the program s messages  and so on  this is solved in amigaos by the use of assigns  an assign follows  again  the same syntax as a device name  however  it already points to a directory inside the filesystem  the place an assign points to can be changed at any time by the user  this behavior is similar to  but nevertheless distinct from the subst command in ms dos for example   assigns were also convenient because one logical assign could point to more than one different physical location at the same time  thereby allowing an assign s contents to expand logically  while still maintaining a separate physical organization  standard assigns that are generally present in an amigaos system include     amigaos   introduced new system for allocating ram and defragmenting it  on the fly  during system inactivities  it is based on slab allocation method and there is also present a memory pager that arbitrates paging memory and allows the swapping of large portions of physical ram on mass storage devices as a sort of virtual memory      co operative paging was finally implemented in amigaos         since the introduction of amigaos in      there have been four major versions and several minor revisions  up until release     of the amiga s operating system  commodore used workbench to refer to the entire amiga operating system  as a consequence workbench was commonly used to refer to both the operating system and the file manager component  for end users workbench was often synonymous with amigaos  from version     the os was renamed  amigaos  and pre     versions were also retroactively referred to as  amigaos   rather than workbench   subsequently   workbench  refers to the native graphical file manager only     from its inception  workbench offered a highly customizable interface  the user could change the aspect of program icons replacing it with newer ones with different color combinations  users could also take a  snapshot  of icons and windows so the icons will remain on the desktop at coordinates chosen by user and windows will open at the desired size     amigaos     was released with the first amiga  the amiga       in       the   x versions of amigaos by default used a garish blue and orange color scheme  designed to give high contrast on even the worst of television screens  the colors can be changed by the user   versions     consists mostly of bug fixes and  like version      was distributed for the amiga      only     the display was highly customizable for the era  the user was free to create and modify system and user icons  which could be of arbitrary size and design and can have two image states to produce a pseudo animated effect when selected  users could customize four display colors and choose from two resolutions          or          interlaced  on ntsc  or         or         on pal systems  in later revisions  the tv or monitor overscan could be adjusted     several features were deprecated in later versions  for example  the gauge meter showing the free space on a file system was replaced with a percentage in amigaos      under workbench   x  right clicking on icons opens a display of the files metadata  whereas from workbench     right clicking activates pull down menus only  the default  busy  pointer  a comic balloon showing  zzz      was replaced with a stopwatch in later versions     amigaos     was released with the launch of the amiga      in       until amigaos     there was no unified look and feel design standard and application developers had to write their own widgets  both buttons and menus  if they wished to enhance the already meager selection of standard basic widgets provided by intuition  with amigaos     gadtools library was created  which provided standard widget sets  the amiga user interface style guide    was published which explained how applications should be laid out for consistency  intuition was improved with boopsi  basic object oriented programming system for intuition  which enhanced the system with an object oriented interface to define a system of classes in which every class individuate a single widget or describes an interface event  it can be used to program object oriented interfaces into amiga at any level     amigaos     also added support for public screens  instead of the amigaos screen being the only shareable screen  applications could create their own named screens to share with other applications     amigaos     introduced amigaguide  a simple text only hypertext markup scheme and browser  for providing online help inside applications  it also introduced installer  a standard software installation program  driven by a lisp like scripting language     amigaos     rectified the problem of applications hooking directly into the input events stream to capture keyboard and mouse movements  sometimes locking up the whole system  amigaos     provided commodities  a standard interface for modifying or scanning input events  this included a standard method for specifying global  hotkey  key sequences  and a commodities exchange registry for the user to see which commodities were running     amigaos     introduced multi lingual locale support through locale library and for the first time amigaos was translated to different languages       version     was originally shipped with the amiga      and amiga      computers  version     added datatypes support and workbench could load any background image in any format if the required datatype was installed  this feature was also used in multiview  its capabilities were directly related to the datatypes installed in devs datatypes  the established amigaguide hypertext system gained more usability by using document links pointing to mediafiles  for example pictures or sounds  all recognized by the datatypes     around six years after amigaos     was released  following commodore s demise  haage   partner were commissionedwho  to update amigaos  which was released in      as a software only update for existing systems     the amigaos look and feel  though still largely based on the earlier     release was revised somewhat  with an improved user interface based on reaction  improved icon rendering and official support for true color backdrops  these releases included support for existing third party gui enhancements  such as newicons  by integrating these patches into the system  the     and     releases included a new set of     color icons and a choice of desktop wallpaper  these replaced the default all metal gray     color scheme used on amigaos from release     to         the     release of amigaos was again developed by haage partner and released in       the main improvements were the introduction of a program start bar called amidock  revised user interfaces for system settings and improved utility programs     this new amigaos  called amigaos     has been rewritten to become fully powerpc compatible  since the fourth developer pre release update a new technique is adopted and the screens are draggable in any direction    drag and drop of workbench icons between different screens is possible too     also in amigaos     were new version of amidock  truetype opentype fonts and movie player with divx and mpeg   support     in amigaos      a new start up preferences feature was added which replaced wbstartup drawer  additional enhancements were a new icon set to complement higher screen resolutions  new window themes including drop shadows  amidock with true transparency  scalable icons and amigaos with auto update feature
