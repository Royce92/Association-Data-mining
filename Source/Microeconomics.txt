 microeconomics  from greek prefix mikro  meaning  small  and economics  is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and small impacting organizations in making decisions on the allocation of limited resources  see scarcity    typically  it applies to markets where goods or services are bought and sold  microeconomics examines how these decisions and behaviors affect the supply and demand for goods and services  which determines prices  and how prices  in turn  determine the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of goods and services       this is in contrast to macroeconomics  which involves the  sum total of economic activity  dealing with the issues of growth  inflation  and unemployment    microeconomics also deals with the effects of national economic policies  such as changing taxation levels  on the aforementioned aspects of the economy   particularly in the wake of the lucas critique  much of modern macroeconomic theory has been built upon  microfoundations  i e  based upon basic assumptions about micro level behavior     one of the goals of microeconomics is to analyze market mechanisms that establish relative prices amongst goods and services and allocation of limited resources amongst many alternative uses  microeconomics also analyzes market failure  where markets fail to produce efficient results  and describes the theoretical conditions needed for perfect competition  significant fields of study in microeconomics include general equilibrium  markets under asymmetric information  choice under uncertainty and economic applications of game theory  also considered is the elasticity of products within the market system             microeconomic theory typically begins with the study of a single rational and utility maximizing individual  to economists  rationality means an individual possesses stable preferences that are both complete and transitive  the technical assumption that preference relations are continuous is needed to ensure the existence of a utility function  although microeconomic theory can continue without this assumption  it would make comparative statics impossible since there is no guarantee that the resulting utility function would be differentiable     microeconomic theory progresses by defining a competitive budget set which is a subset of the consumption set  it as at this point that economists make the technical assumption that preferences are locally non satiated  without the assumption of lns  local non satiation  there is no guarantee that a rational individual would maximize utility  with the necessary tools and assumptions in place the utility maximization problem  ump  is developed     the utility maximization problem is the heart of consumer theory  the utility maximization problem attempts to explain the action axiom by imposing rationality axioms on consumer preferences and then mathematically modeling and analyzing the consequences  the utility maximization problem serves not only as the mathematical foundation of consumer theory but as a metaphysical explanation of it as well  that is  the utility maximization problem is used by economists to not only explain what or how individuals make choices by why individuals make choices as well     the utility maximization problem is a simple constrained optimization problem in which an individual seeks to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint  economists use the extreme value theorem to guarantee that a solution to the utility maximization problem exists  that is  since the budget constraint is both bounded and closed a solution to the utility maximization problem exists  economists call the solution to the utility maximization problem a walrasian demand function or correspondence     the theory of supply and demand usually assumes that markets are perfectly competitive  this implies that there are many buyers and sellers in the market and none of them have the capacity to significantly influence prices of goods and services  in many real life transactions  the assumption fails because some individual buyers or sellers have the ability to influence prices  quite often  a sophisticated analysis is required to understand the demand supply equation of a good model  however  the theory works well in situations meeting these assumptions     mainstream economics does not assume a priori that markets are preferable to other forms of social organization  in fact  much analysis is devoted to cases where market failures lead to resource allocation that is suboptimal and creates deadweight loss  a classic example of suboptimal resource allocation is that of a public good  in such cases  economists may attempt to find policies that avoid waste  either directly by government control  indirectly by regulation that induces market participants to act in a manner consistent with optimal welfare  or by creating  missing markets  to enable efficient trading where none had previously existed     this is studied in the field of collective action and public choice theory   optimal welfare  usually takes on a paretian norm  which is a mathematical application of the kaldor hicks method  this can diverge from the utilitarian goal of maximizing utility because it does not consider the distribution of goods between people  market failure in positive economics  microeconomics  is limited in implications without mixing the belief of the economist and their theory     the demand for various commodities by individuals is generally thought of as the outcome of a utility maximizing process  with each individual trying to maximize their own utility under a budget constraint and a given consumption set     the study of microeconomics involves several  key  areas     supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a perfectly competitive market  it concludes that in a perfectly competitive market with no externalities  per unit taxes  or price controls  the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers  this price results in a stable economic equilibrium     elasticity is the measurement of how responsive an economic variable is to a change in another variable  elasticity can be quantified as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to the percentage change in another variable  when the later variable has a causal influence on the former  it is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable  or of the function that determines it  to changes in causative variables in unitless ways  frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand  price elasticity of supply  income elasticity of demand  elasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution     consumer demand theory relates preferences for the consumption of both goods and services to the consumption expenditures  ultimately  this relationship between preferences and consumption expenditures is used to relate preferences to consumer demand curves  the link between personal preferences  consumption and the demand curve is one of the most closely studied relations in economics  it is a way of analyzing how consumers may achieve equilibrium between preferences and expenditures by maximizing utility subject to consumer budget constraints     production theory is the study of production  or the economic process of converting inputs into outputs  production uses resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use  gift giving in a gift economy  or exchange in a market economy  this can include manufacturing  storing  shipping  and packaging  some economists define production broadly as all economic activity other than consumption  they see every commercial activity other than the final purchase as some form of production     the cost of production theory of value is the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it  the cost can comprise any of the factors of production  labour  capital  land  technology can be viewed either as a form of fixed capital  ex plant  or circulating capital  ex intermediate goods      perfect competition describes markets such that no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product  an example is ebay     a monopoly  from greek monos        alone or single    polein         to sell   exists when a single company is the only supplier of a particular commodity     an oligopoly is a market form in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of sellers  oligopolists   oligopolies can create the incentive for firms to engage in collusion and form cartels that reduce competition leading to higher prices for consumers and less overall market output      the market structure can have several types of interacting market systems  different forms of markets is a feature of capitalism and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees  competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system     examples of markets include but are not limited to  commodity markets  insurance markets  bond markets  energy markets  flea markets  debt markets  stock markets  online auctions  media exchange markets  real estate market     game theory is a major method used in mathematical economics and business for modeling competing behaviors of interacting agents  applications include a wide array of economic phenomena and approaches  such as auctions  bargaining  mergers   acquisitions pricing  fair division  duopolies  oligopolies  social network formation  agent based computational economics  general equilibrium  mechanism design and voting systems  and across such broad areas as experimental economics  behavioral economics  information economics  industrial organization  and political economy     labour economics seeks to understand the functioning and dynamics of the markets for wage labour  labour markets function through the interaction of workers and employers  labour economics looks at the suppliers of labour services  workers   the demands of labour services  employers   and attempts to understand the resulting pattern of wages  employment  and income  in economics  labour is a measure of the work done by human beings  it is conventionally contrasted with such other factors of production as land and capital  there are theories which have developed a concept called human capital  referring to the skills that workers possess  not necessarily their actual work   although there are also counter posing macro economic system theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms     welfare economics is a branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to evaluate well being from allocation of productive factors as to desirability and economic efficiency within an economy  often relative to competitive general equilibrium   it analyzes social welfare  however measured  in terms of economic activities of the individuals that compose the theoretical society considered  accordingly  individuals  with associated economic activities  are the basic units for aggregating to social welfare  whether of a group  a community  or a society  and there is no  social welfare  apart from the  welfare  associated with its individual units     information economics or the economics of information is a branch of microeconomic theory that studies how information and information systems affect an economy and economic decisions  information has special characteristics  it is easy to create but hard to trust  it is easy to spread but hard to control  it influences many decisions  these special characteristics  as compared with other types of goods  complicate many standard economic theories      opportunity cost of an activity  or goods  is equal to the best next alternative uses foregone  although opportunity cost can be hard to quantify  the effect of opportunity cost is universal and very real on the individual level  in fact  this principle applies to all decisions  not just economic ones     opportunity cost is one way to measure the cost of something  rather than merely identifying and adding the costs of a project  one may also identify the next best alternative way to spend the same amount of money  the forgone profit of this next best alternative is the opportunity cost of the original choice  a common example is a farmer that chooses to farm their land rather than rent it to neighbors  wherein the opportunity cost is the forgone profit from renting  in this case  the farmer may expect to generate more profit alone  this kind of reasoning is a very important part of the calculation of discount rates in discounted cash flow investment valuation methodologies  similarly  the opportunity cost of attending university is the lost wages a student could have earned in the workforce  rather than the cost of tuition  books  and other requisite items  whose sum makes up the total cost of attendance      note that opportunity cost is not the sum of the available alternatives  but rather the benefit of the single  best alternative  possible opportunity costs of a city s decision to build a hospital on its vacant land are the loss of the land for a sporting center  or the inability to use the land for a parking lot  or the money that could have been made from selling the land  or the loss of any of the various other possible uses   but not all of these in aggregate  the true opportunity cost would be the forgone profit of the most lucrative of those listed     one question that arises here is how to determine a money value for each alternative to facilitate comparison and assess opportunity cost  which may be more or less difficult depending on the things we are trying to compare  for example  many decisions involve environmental impacts whose monetary value is difficult to assess because of scientific uncertainty  valuing a human life or the economic impact of an arctic oil spill involves making subjective choices with ethical implications     it is imperative to understand that no decision on allocating time is free  no matter what one chooses to do  they are always giving something up in return  an example of opportunity cost is deciding between going to a concert and doing homework  if one decides to go the concert  then they are giving up valuable time to study  but if they choose to do homework then the cost is giving up the concert  any decision in allocating capital is likewise  there is an opportunity cost of capital  or a hurdle rate  defined as the expected rate one could get by investing in similar projects on the open market  opportunity cost is vital in understanding microeconomics and decisions that are made     applied microeconomics includes a range of specialized areas of study  many of which draw on methods from other fields  industrial organization examines topics such as the entry and exit of firms  innovation  and the role of trademarks  labor economics examines wages  employment  and labor market dynamics  financial economics examines topics such as the structure of optimal portfolios  the rate of return to capital  econometric analysis of security returns  and corporate financial behavior  public economics examines the design of government tax and expenditure policies and economic effects of these policies  e g   social insurance programs   political economy examines the role of political institutions in determining policy outcomes  health economics examines the organization of health care systems  including the role of the health care workforce and health insurance programs  urban economics  which examines the challenges faced by cities  such as sprawl  air and water pollution  traffic congestion  and poverty  draws on the fields of urban geography and sociology  law and economics applies microeconomic principles to the selection and enforcement of competing legal regimes and their relative efficiencies  economic history examines the evolution of the economy and economic institutions  using methods and techniques from the fields of economics  history  geography  sociology  psychology  and political science
