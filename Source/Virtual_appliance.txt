 a virtual appliance is a pre configured virtual machine image  ready to run on a hypervisor  virtual appliances are a subset of the broader class of software appliances  installation of a software appliance on a virtual machine and packaging that into an image creates a virtual appliance  like software appliances  virtual appliances are intended to eliminate the installation  configuration and maintenance costs associated with running complex stacks of software     a virtual appliance is not a complete virtual machine platform  but rather a software image containing a software stack designed to run on a virtual machine platform which may be a type   or type   hypervisor  like a physical computer  a hypervisor is merely a platform for running an operating system environment and does not provide application software itself     many virtual appliances provide a web page user interface to permit their configuration  a virtual appliance is usually built to host a single application  it therefore represents a new way to deploy applications on a network             virtual appliances are provided to the user or customer as files  via either electronic downloads or physical distribution  the file format most commonly used is the open virtualization format  ovf   the distributed management task force  dmtf  publishes the ovf specification documentation   most virtualization vendors  including vmware  microsoft  oracle  and citrix  support ovf for virtual appliances      virtualization solves a key problem in the grid computing arena   namely  the reality that any sufficiently large grid will inevitably consist of a wide variety of heterogeneous hardware and operating system configurations  adding virtual appliances into the picture allows for extremely rapid provisioning of grid nodes and importantly  cleanly decouples the grid operator from the grid consumer by encapsulating all knowledge of the application within the virtual appliance     virtual appliances are critical resources in infrastructure as a service cloud computing  the file format of the virtual appliance is the concern of the cloud provider and usually not relevant to the cloud user even though the cloud user may be the owner of the virtual appliance  however  challenges may arise with the transfer of virtual appliance ownership or transfer of virtual appliances between cloud data centers  in this case  virtual appliance copy or export import features can be used to overcome this problem       with the rise of virtualization as a platform for hosted services provision  virtual appliances have come to provide a direct route for traditional on premises applications to be rapidly redeployed in a software as a service  saas  mode   without requiring major application re architecture for multi tenancy  by decoupling the hardware and operating system infrastructure provider from the application stack provider  virtual appliances allow economies of scale on the one side to be leveraged by the economy of simplicity on the other  traditional approaches to saas  such as that touted by salesforce com  leverage shared infrastructure by forcing massive change and increased complexity on the software stack     a concrete example of the virtual appliances approach to delivering saas is the amazon elastic compute cloud  ec     a grid of xen hypervisor nodes coupled with the availability of pre packaged virtual appliances in the amazon machine image format  amazon ec  reduces the cost barrier to the point where it becomes feasible to have each customer of a hosted saas solution provisioned with their own virtual appliance instance s  rather than forcing them to share common instances  prior to ec   single tenant hosted models were too expensive  leading to the failure of many early asp offerings     furthermore  in contrast to the multi tenancy approaches to saas  a virtual appliance can also be deployed on premises for customers that need local network access to the running application  or have security requirements that a third party hosting model does not meet  the underlying virtualization technology also allows for rapid movement of virtual appliances instances between physical execution environments  traditional approaches to saas fix the application in place on the hosted infrastructure
