 a power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load  the primary function of a power supply is to convert one form of electrical energy to another and  as a result  power supplies are sometimes referred to as electric power converters  some power supplies are discrete  stand alone devices  whereas others are built into larger devices along with their loads  examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices     every power supply must obtain the energy it supplies to its load  as well as any energy it consumes while performing that task  from an energy source  depending on its design  a power supply may obtain energy from various types of energy sources  including electrical energy transmission systems  energy storage devices such as a batteries and fuel cells  electromechanical systems such as generators and alternators  solar power converters  or another power supply     all power supplies have a power input  which receives energy from the energy source  and a power output that delivers energy to the load  in most power supplies the power input and output consist of electrical connectors or hardwired circuit connections  though some power supplies employ wireless energy transfer in lieu of galvanic connections for the power input or output  some power supplies have other types of inputs and outputs as well  for functions such as external monitoring and control             power supplies are categorized in various ways  including by functional features  for example  a regulated power supply is one that maintains constant output voltage or current despite variations in load current or input voltage  conversely  the output of an unregulated power supply can change significantly when its input voltage or load current changes  adjustable power supplies allow the output voltage or current to be programmed by mechanical controls  e g   knobs on the power supply front panel   or by means of a control input  or both  an adjustable regulated power supply is one that is both adjustable and regulated  an isolated power supply has a power output that is electrically independent of its power input  this is in contrast to other power supplies that share a common connection between power input and output     power supplies are packaged in different ways and classified accordingly  a bench power supply is a stand alone desktop unit used in applications such as circuit test and development  open frame power supplies have only a partial mechanical enclosure  sometimes consisting of only a mounting base  these are typically built into machinery or other equipment  rack mount power supplies are designed to be secured into standard electronic equipment racks     power supplies can be broadly divided into linear and switching types  linear power converters process the input power directly  with all active power conversion components operating in their linear operating regions  in switching power converters  the input power is converted to ac or to dc pulses before processing  by components that operate predominantly in non linear modes  e g   transistors that spend most of their time in cutoff or saturation   power is  lost   converted to heat  when components operate in their linear regions and  consequently  switching converters are usually more efficient than linear converters because their components spend less time in linear operating regions     a dc power supply is one that supplies a voltage of fixed polarity  either positive or negative  to its load  depending on its design  a dc power supply may be powered from a dc source or from an ac source such as the power mains     some dc power supplies use ac mains electricity as an energy source  such power supplies will sometimes employ a transformer to convert the input voltage to a higher or lower ac voltage  a rectifier is used to convert the transformer output voltage to a varying dc voltage  which in turn is passed through an electronic filter to convert it to an unregulated dc voltage  the filter removes most  but not all of the ac voltage variations  the remaining voltage variations are known as ripple     the electric load s tolerance of ripple dictates the minimum amount of filtering that must be provided by a power supply  in some applications  high ripple is tolerated and therefore no filtering is required  for example  in some battery charging applications it is possible to implement a mains powered dc power supply with nothing more than a transformer and a single rectifier diode  with a resistor in series with the output to limit charging current     the function of a linear voltage regulator is to convert a varying dc voltage to a constant  often specific  lower dc voltage  in addition  they often provide a current limiting function to protect the power supply and load from overcurrent  excessive  potentially destructive current      a constant output voltage is required in many power supply applications  but the voltage provided by many energy sources will vary with changes in load impedance  furthermore  when an unregulated dc power supply is the energy source  its output voltage will also vary with changing input voltage  to circumvent this  some power supplies use a linear voltage regulator to maintain the output voltage at a steady value  independent of fluctuations in input voltage and load impedance  linear regulators can also reduce the magnitude of ripple and noise present appearing on the output voltage     an ac power supply typically takes the voltage from a wall outlet  mains supply  and lowers it to the desired voltage  some filtering may take place as well     in a switched mode power supply  smps   the ac mains input is directly rectified and then filtered to obtain a dc voltage  the resulting dc voltage is then switched on and off at a high frequency by electronic switching circuitry  thus producing an ac current that will pass through a high frequency transformer or inductor  switching occurs at a very high frequency  typically   xa khz    xa mhz   thereby enabling the use of transformers and filter capacitors that are much smaller  lighter  and less expensive than those found in linear power supplies operating at mains frequency  after the inductor or transformer secondary  the high frequency ac is rectified and filtered to produce the dc output voltage  if the smps uses an adequately insulated high frequency transformer  the output will be electrically isolated from the mains  this feature is often essential for safety     switched mode power supplies are usually regulated  and to keep the output voltage constant  the power supply employs a feedback controller that monitors current drawn by the load  the switching duty cycle increases as power output requirements increase     smpss often include safety features such as current limiting or a crowbar circuit to help protect the device and the user from harm   in the event that an abnormal high current power draw is detected  the switched mode supply can assume this is a direct short and will shut itself down before damage is done  pc power supplies often provide a power good signal to the motherboard  the absence of this signal prevents operation when abnormal supply voltages are present     smpss have an absolute limit on their minimum current output   they are only able to output above a certain power level and cannot function below that point  in a no load condition the frequency of the power slicing circuit increases to great speed  causing the isolated transformer to act as a tesla coil  causing damage due to the resulting very high voltage power spikes  switched mode supplies with protection circuits may briefly turn on but then shut down when no load has been detected  a very small low power dummy load such as a ceramic power resistor or    watt light bulb can be attached to the supply to allow it to run with no primary load attached     power factor has become an issue of concern for computer manufacturers  switched mode power supplies have traditionally been a source of power line harmonics and have a very poor power factor  the rectifier input stage distorts the waveshape of current drawn from the supply  this can produce adverse effects on other loads  the distorted current causes extra heating in the wires and distribution equipment  switched mode power supplies in a building can result in poor power quality for other utility customers  customers may face higher electric bills for a low power factor load     some switch mode power supplies use filters or additional switching stages in the incoming rectifier circuit to improve the waveform of the current taken from the ac line  this adds to the circuit complexity  many computer power supplies built in the last few years now include power factor correction built right into the switched mode supply  and may advertise the fact that they offer     power factor     a programmable power supply is one that allows remote control of its operation through an analog input or digital interface such as rs    or gpib  controlled properties may include voltage  current  and in the case of ac output power supplies  frequency  they are used in a wide variety of applications  including automated equipment testing  crystal growth monitoring  semiconductor fabrication  and x ray generators     programmable power supplies typically employ an integral microcomputer to control and monitor power supply operation  power supplies equipped with a computer interface may use proprietary communication protocols or standard protocols and device control languages such as scpi     an uninterruptible power supply  ups  takes its power from two or more sources simultaneously  it is usually powered directly from the ac mains  while simultaneously charging a storage battery  should there be a dropout or failure of the mains  the battery instantly takes over so that the load never experiences an interruption  in a computer installation  this gives the operators time to shut down the system in an orderly way  other ups schemes may use an internal combustion engine or turbine to continuously supply power to a system in parallel with power coming from the ac  the engine driven generators would normally be idling  but could come to full power in a matter of a few seconds in order to keep vital equipment running without interruption  such a scheme might be found in hospitals or telephone central offices     a high voltage power supply is one that outputs hundreds or thousands of volts  a special output connector is used that prevents arcing  insulation breakdown and accidental human contact  federal standard connectors are typically used for applications above    kv  though other types of connectors  e g   shv connector  may be used at lower voltages  some high voltage power supplies provide an analog input that can be used to control the output voltage  effectively allowing them to function as high voltage amplifiers  albeit with very limited bandwidth  high voltage power supplies are commonly used to accelerate and manipulate electron and ion beams in equipment such as x ray generators  electron microscopes  and focused ion beam columns  and in a variety of other applications  including electrophoresis and electrostatics     high voltage power supplies typically apply the bulk of their input energy to a power inverter  which in turn drives a voltage multiplier or a high turns ratio  high voltage transformer  or both  usually a transformer followed by a multiplier  to produce high voltage  the high voltage is passed out of the power supply through the special connector  and is also applied to a voltage divider that converts it to a low voltage metering signal compatible with low voltage circuitry  the metering signal is used by a closed loop controller that regulates the high voltage by controlling inverter input power  and it may also be conveyed out of the power supply to allow external circuitry to monitor the high voltage output     the suitability of a particular power supply for an application is determined by various attributes of the power supply  which are typically listed in the power supply s specification  commonly specified attributes for a power supply include     a modern computer power supply is a switch mode power supply that converts ac power from the mains supply  to several dc voltages  switch mode supplies replaced linear supplies due to cost  weight  and size improvement  the diverse collection of output voltages also have widely varying current draw requirements     arc welding uses electricity to melt the surfaces of the metals in order to join them together through coalescence  the electricity is provided by a welding power supply  and can either be ac or dc  arc welding typically requires high currents typically between     and     amperes  some types of welding can use as few as    amperes  while some applications of spot welding employ currents as high as        amperes for an extremely short time  older welding power supplies consisted of transformers or engines driving generators  more recent supplies use semiconductors and microprocessors reducing their size and weight     a power supply that is built into an ac mains power plug is known as a  plug pack  or  plug in adapter   or by slang terms such as  wall wart   they are even more diverse than their names  often with either the same kind of dc plug offering different voltage or polarity  or a different plug offering the same voltage   universal  adapters attempt to replace missing or damaged ones  using multiple plugs and selectors for different voltages and polarities  replacement power supplies must match the voltage of  and supply at least as much current as  the original power supply     the least expensive ac units consist only of a small transformer  while dc adapters include a few additional diodes  whether or not a load is connected to the power adapter  the transformer has a magnetic field continuously present and normally cannot be completely turned off unless unplugged     because they consume standby power  they are sometimes known as  electricity vampires  and may be plugged into a power strip to allow turning them off     in contrast  switched mode power supplies can cut off leaky electrolyte capacitors  use powerless mosfets  and reduce their working frequency to get a gulp of energy once in a while to power  for example  a clock  which would otherwise need a battery     power supplies often have protection from short circuit or overload that could damage the supply or cause a fire  fuses and circuit breakers are two commonly used mechanisms for overload protection      a fuse contains a short piece of wire which melts if too much current flows  this effectively disconnects the power supply from its load  and the equipment stops working until the problem that caused the overload is identified and the fuse is replaced  some power supplies use a very thin wire link soldered in place as a fuse  fuses in power supply units may be replaceable by the end user  but fuses in consumer equipment may require tools to access and change     a circuit breaker contains an element that heats  bends and triggers a spring which shuts the circuit down  once the element cools  and the problem is identified the breaker can be reset and the power restored     some psus use a thermal cutout buried in the transformer rather than a fuse  the advantage is it allows greater current to be drawn for limited time than the unit can supply continuously  some such cutouts are self resetting  some are single use only     some supplies use current limiting instead of cutting off power if overloaded  the two types of current limiting used are electronic limiting and impedance limiting  the former is common on lab bench psus  the latter is common on supplies of less than   watts output     a foldback current limiter reduces the output current to much less than the maximum non fault current
