 maintenance  repair and operations   mro  or maintenance  repair  and overhaul involves fixing any sort of mechanical  plumbing or electrical device should it become out of order or broken  known as repair  unscheduled  or casualty maintenance   it also includes performing routine actions which keep the device in working order  known as scheduled maintenance  or prevent trouble from arising  preventive maintenance   mro may be defined as   all actions which have the objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function  the actions include the combination of all technical and corresponding administrative  managerial  and supervision actions        mro operations can be categorised by whether the product remains the property of the customer  i e  a service is being offered  or whether the product is bought by the reprocessing organisation and sold to any customer wishing to make the purchase  guadette         in the former case it may be a backshop operation within a larger organization or smaller operation     the former of these represents a closed loop supply chain and usually has the scope of maintenance  repair or overhaul of the product  the latter of the categorisations is an open loop supply chain and is typified by refurbishment and remanufacture  the main characteristic of the closed loop system is that the demand for a product is matched with the supply of a used product  neglecting asset write offs and exceptional activities the total population of the product between the customer and the service provider remains constant             in telecommunication  commercial real estate and engineering in general  the term maintenance has the following meanings     manufacturers and industrial supply companies often refer to mro as opposed to original equipment manufacturer  oem   oem includes any activity related to the direct manufacture of goods  where mro refers to any maintenance and repair activity to keep a manufacturing plant running     industrial supply companies can generally be sorted into two types     generally speaking  there are three types of maintenance in use     preventive maintenance is maintenance performed in an attempt to avoid failures  unnecessary production loss and safety violations     the effectiveness of a preventive maintenance schedule depends on the rcm analysis which it was based on  and the ground rules used for cost effectivity      corrective maintenance is probably the most commonly used approach  but it is easy to see its limitations  when equipment fails  it often leads to downtime in production  in most cases  this is costly business  also  if the equipment needs to be replaced  the cost of replacing it alone can be substantial  it is also important to consider health  safety and environment  hse  issues related to malfunctioning equipment     corrective maintenance can be defined as the maintenance which is required when an item has failed or worn out  to bring it back to working order  corrective maintenance is carried out on all items where the consequences of failure or wearing out are not significant and the cost of this maintenance is much greater than preventive maintenance     corrective maintenance is the program focused on the regular task that will maintain all the critical machinery and the system in optimum operating conditions  the major objectives of the program are to   eliminating breakdown   eliminating deviation   eliminating unnecessary repairs   optimize all the critical planned system    reliability centered maintenance is an engineering framework that enables the definition of a complete maintenance regime  it regards maintenance as the means to maintain the functions a user may require of machinery in a defined operating context  as a discipline it enables machinery stakeholders to monitor  assess  predict and generally understand the working of their physical assets  this is embodied in the initial part of the rcm process which is to identify the operating context of the machinery  and write a failure mode effects and criticality analysis  fmeca   the second part of the analysis is to apply the  rcm logic   which helps determine the appropriate maintenance tasks for the identified failure modes in the fmeca  once the logic is complete for all elements in the fmeca  the resulting list of maintenance is  packaged   so that the periodicities of the tasks are rationalised to be called up in work packages  it is important not to destroy the applicability of maintenance in this phase  lastly  rcm is kept live throughout the  in service  life of machinery  where the effectiveness of the maintenance is kept under constant review and adjusted in light of the experience gained     in many organizations because of the number of devices or products that need to be maintained or the complexity of systems  there is a need to manage the information with software packages  this is particularly the case in aerospace  e g  airline fleets   military installations  large plants  e g  manufacturing  power generation  petrochemical  and ships     these software tools help engineers and technicians in increasing the system availability and reducing costs and repair times as well as reducing material supply time and increasing material availability by improving supply chain communication     as mro involves working with an organization s products  resources  suppliers and customers  mro packages have to interface with many enterprise business software systems  plm  eam  erp  scm  crm      one of the functions of such software is the configuration of bills of materials or boms  taking the component parts list from engineering  ebom  and manufacturing  mbom  and updating it from  as designed  through  as built    as delivered    as maintained   and  as used      another function is project planning logistics  for example identifying the critical path on the list of tasks to be carried out  inspection  diagnosis  locate order parts and service  to calculate turnaround times  tat      other tasks that software can perform     many of these tasks are addressed in computerized maintenance management systems  cmms   data standards have been developed around these activities  most notably eamxml and mimosa     mro goods are typically defined as any goods used in the creation of a product but not in the final product itself  examples include
