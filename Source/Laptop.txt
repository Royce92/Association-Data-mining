 a laptop or a notebook is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor  suitable for mobile use   there was a difference between laptops and notebooks in the past  but nowadays it has gradually died away   laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings  including at work  in education  and for personal multimedia     a laptop combines the components and inputs of a desktop computer  including display  speakers  keyboard and pointing device  such as a touchpad or a trackpad  into a single device  most modern day laptops also have an integrated webcam and a microphone  a laptop can be powered either from a rechargeable battery  or by mains electricity via an ac adapter  laptop is a diverse category of devices and other more specific terms  such as rugged notebook or convertible  refer to specialist types of laptops  which have been optimized for specific uses  hardware specifications change significantly between different types  makes and models of laptops     portable computers  which later developed into modern laptops  were originally considered to be a small niche market  mostly for specialized field applications  such as the military  accountancy  for sales representatives etc  as portable computers developed and became more like modern laptops  becoming smaller  lighter  cheaper  and more powerful  they became very widely used for a variety of purposes              the term laptop was coined in the early     s to describe a mobile computer which can be used on one s lap  and to distinguish these devices from earlier  much heavier  portable computers  several years later  manufacturers started producing even smaller portable devices  further reducing their weight and size and incorporating a display roughly the size of a  paper  these were marketed as notebooks to distinguish them from bulkier laptops      today the term laptop is used in most parts of the world and notebook in some other parts  e g   in russia  to describe a portable computer in general  the difference in the meanings of these terms has diminished over time and  for example  the gaming machine alienware    gaming laptop  provided with an    inch display and weighing more than   kilograms    xa lb   is considered both a laptop and a notebook  although it neither can be comfortably used on a lap nor even remotely fits a notebook drawing pad size      as the personal computer  pc  became feasible in       the idea of a portable personal computer followed  a  personal  portable information manipulator  was imagined by alan kay at xerox parc in        and described in his      paper as the  dynabook       the ibm special computer apl machine portable  scamp   was demonstrated in       this prototype was based on the ibm palm processor  put all logic in microcode or     bit       the ibm       the first commercially available portable computer  appeared in september       and was based on the scamp prototype      as   bit cpu machines became widely accepted  the number of portables increased rapidly  the osborne    released in       used the zilog z   and weighed      pounds      xa kg   it had no battery  a  xa in    xa cm  crt screen  and dual     xa in      xa cm  single density floppy drives  in the same year the first laptop sized portable computer  the epson hx     was announced    the epson had a lcd screen  a rechargeable battery  and a calculator size printer in a    xa kg     xa lb  chassis  both tandy radioshack and hp also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period         the first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early     s  the dulmont magnum was released in australia in          but was not marketed internationally until          the us        us        today  grid compass       released in       was used at nasa and by the military among others  the gavilan sc  released in       was the first computer described as a  laptop  by its manufacturer    from      onward  several new input techniques were developed and included in laptops  including the touchpad  gavilan sc         the pointing stick  ibm thinkpad            and handwriting recognition  linus write top           some cpus  such as the      intel i   sl  were designed to use minimum power to increase battery life of portable computers  and were supported by dynamic power management features such as intel speedstep and amd powernow  in some designs     displays reached vga resolution by       compaq slt       and colour screens started becoming a common upgrade in      with increases in resolution and screen size occurring frequently until the introduction of     screen laptops in       hard drives started to be used in portables  encouraged by the introduction of      drives in the late     s  and became common in laptops starting with the introduction of      and smaller drives around       capacities have typically lagged behind physically larger desktop drives  optical storage  read only cd rom followed by writeable cd and later read only or writeable dvd and blu ray  became common in laptops early in the     s     since the introduction of portable computers in late   s  their form has seriously changed over decades  spawning a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses     the form of a traditional laptop computer is a clamshell  with a screen on one of its inner sides and a keyboard on the opposite  it can be easily folded to conserve space while traveling  the screen and keyboard are inaccessible while closed  devices of this form are commonly called a  traditional laptop  or notebook  particularly if they have a screen size of    to    inches measured diagonally and run a full featured operating system like windows      os x or linux  traditional laptops are the most common form of laptop  although chromebooks  ultrabooks  convertibles and laplets  described below  are becoming more common  with similar performance being achieved in their more portable or affordable forms     a subnotebook or an ultraportable is a laptop designed and marketed with an emphasis on portability  small size  low weight and often longer battery life   subnotebooks are usually smaller and lighter than standard laptops  weighing between     and  xa kg    to   pounds     with a battery life  exceeding    hours    since the introduction of netbooks and ultrabooks  the line between subnotebooks and either category has been blurry  netbooks are in essence a more basic featured and a cheap subcategory of subnotebooks  and while some ultrabooks have a screen size too large to qualify as subnotebooks  certain ultrabooks fit in a subnotebook category  one notable example of a subnotebook is apple macbook air     netbook was a form of a laptop as inexpensive  light weight  energy efficient device  especially suited for wireless communication and internet access      netbooks first became commercially available in around      on the market  featuring a weight  a display size and a price combination of     kg       and   u s       respectively  the name netbook  with net short for internet  is used as  the device excels in web based computing performance     to begin with  netbooks were mostly sold with light weight variants of the linux operating system  although later versions often have windows xp or windows   operating systems  all major netbook producing companies stopped producing them by the end of            typical modern convertibles have a complex joint between the keyboard housing and the display permitting the display panel to swivel and then lie flat on the keyboard housing  most convertibles feature a touchscreen display alongside the traditional touchpad  to work in a tablet mode  the convertibles fit both in laptop and tablet device categories  but usually considered laptops  due to increased size and weight over the mainstream tablets     the single joint used to enable the rotate and swivel motion of the screen creates a physical point of weakness on the laptop  some manufacturers have attempted to overcome these weak points by adopting innovative methods such as a sliding design in which the screen slides up from the slate like position and locks into place to provide the laptop mode  due to the design of convertibles  they have few other weaknesses over traditional laptops  although a smaller form is often desired to increase portability     the most recent laptop device category is a laplet  it is a portmanteau of the words laptop and tablet and it is a crossover of these device types    although being typically considered as a tablet  by such agencies as faa and tsa   laplets share certain similarities to laptops  and may be considered as its alternative form  laplets are often marketed as a laptop replacement tablets     its specification is most closely resembles one of an ultrabook  but laplet is made of two distinct parts  offering a touchscreen display which can be separated from the keyboard  laplets are often very thin  around   xa mm  and light devices with a long battery life  compared to mainstream tablets  laplets can be distinguished from them as they feature an x   architecture cpu  typically low  or ultra low voltage model   such as intel core i   run a full featured os like windows      and have a number of typical laptop i o ports  such as usb and mini displayport     laplets are designed to be used not only as a media consumption device  but also as a valid desktop or laptop replacement due to their ability to run desktop applications  such as adobe photoshop  connect multiple peripheral devices  such as a mouse  keyboard and a number of external displays       a desktop replacement laptop is a class of large device  which is not intended primarily for mobile use  they are bulkier and not as portable as other laptops  and are intended for use as compact and transportable alternatives to a desktop computer    desktop replacements are larger and typically heavier than other classes of laptops  they are capable of containing more powerful components and have a    inch or larger display       desktop replacement laptops  operation time on batteries is typically shorter than other laptops  in rare cases they have no battery at all  in the past  some laptops in this class used a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance for the same price at the expense of a battery life  although the practice has largely died out       the names media center laptops and gaming laptops are used to describe specialized notebook computers  often overlapping with the desktop replacement form factor       a rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations  extreme temperatures  and wet or dusty environments  rugged laptops are usually designed from scratch  rather than adapted from regular consumer laptop models  rugged laptops are bulkier  heavier  and much more expensive than regular laptops    and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use     the design features found in rugged laptops include a rubber sheeting under keyboard keys  a sealed port and connector covers  a passive cooling  very bright displays  easily readable in daylight  cases and frames made of magnesium alloys that are much stronger  than plastic found in commercial laptops and solid state storage devices or hard disc drives  that are shock mounted to withstand constant vibrations  rugged laptops are commonly used by public safety services  police  fire and medical emergency   military  utilities  field service technicians  construction  mining and oil drilling personnel  rugged laptops are usually sold to organizations  rather than individuals  and are rarely marketed via retail channels     the basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts  traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use  although as of the present decade an increasing number of desktop systems use the same smaller  lower power parts which originally evolved for mobile use  the design bounds on power  size  and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components  although that difference has increasingly narrowed over recent years     in general  laptop components are not intended to be replaceable  a few  such as processors  follow their own standards but are difficult to replace because of other factors  for example  in the case of processors cooling and access limitations can make upgrades very difficult or impossible   in a very compact laptops  such as laplets  there may be no upgradeable components at all       intel  asus  compal  quanta and some other laptop manufacturers have created the common building block standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards       the following list summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts       most modern laptops feature a    inches    xa cm  or larger color active matrix displays based on led lighting with resolutions of                  or                 pixels and above  models with led based lighting offer lesser power consumption  and often higher brightness  netbooks with a    inches    xa cm  or smaller screen typically use a resolution of           while netbooks and subnotebooks with a      inches    xa cm  or    inches    xa cm  screen use standard notebook resolutions  having a higher resolution display may allow more items to fit onscreen at a time  improving the user s ability to multitask  although at the higher resolutions on smaller screens  the resolution may only serve to display sharper graphics and text rather than increasing the usable area  since the introduction of the macbook pro with retina display in       there has been an increase in the availability of very high resolution            and higher  displays  even in relatively small systems  and in typical    inch screens resolutions as high as           are available     external displays can be connected to most laptops  and models with mini displayport can handle up to three       a laptop central processing unit  cpu  have advanced power saving features and produce less heat  than one intended purely for desktop use  typically laptop cpu have two processor cores  although   core models are also available  for low price and mainstream performance  there is no longer a significant performance difference between laptop and desktop cpus  but at the high end the fastest   to   core desktop cpus are still substantially outperform the fastest   core laptop processors  at the expense of massively higher power utilization and heat generation   the fastest laptop processors top out at    watts of heat  while the fastest desktop processors top out at     watts     there have been a wide range of cpus designed for laptops available from both intel  amd and other manufacturers  on non x   architectures  motorola and ibm produced the chips for the former powerpc based apple laptops  ibook and powerbook   many laptops have removable cpus  although this has become less common in the past few years as the trend has been to increasingly thin and light models  in other laptops the cpu is soldered on the motherboard and is non replaceable  this is nearly universal in ultrabooks  for example     in the past  some laptops have used a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have high performance gains at the cost of greater weight  heat and limited battery life  the practice is largely extinct as of          unlike their desktop counterparts  laptop cpus are nearly impossible to overclock  a thermal operating mode of laptops is very close to its limits and there is almost no headroom for an overclocking related operating temperature increase  a possibility to improve a cooling system of a laptop to allow overclocking is extremely rare     on most laptops a graphical processing unit  gpu  is integrated into the cpu to conserve power and space  this was introduced by intel with the core i series of mobile processors in       and similar apu processors by amd later that year  prior to that  lower end machines tended to use graphics processors integrated to the system chipset  while higher end machines had a separate graphics processor  in the past  laptops lacking a separate graphics processor were limited in their utility for gaming and professional applications involving  d graphics  but the capabilities of cpu integrated graphics has converged with the low end of dedicated graphics processors in the past few years  higher end laptops intended for gaming or professional  d work still come with dedicated  in some cases even dual  graphics processors on the motherboard or as an internal expansion card  since       these almost always involve switchable graphics so that when there is not demand for the higher performance dedicated graphics processor  the more power efficient integrated graphics processor will be used  nvidia optimus is an example of this sort of system of switchable graphics     most laptops use so dimm memory modules  these are about half the size of desktop dimms    they may be accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading  or placed in locations not intended for user replacement  most laptops have two memory slots  although some of the lowest end will have only one  and some high end models  usually mobile engineering workstations  and a few high end models intended for gaming  have four  most mid range laptops are factory equipped with     gb of ram  netbooks are commonly equipped with only     gb of ram and generally only expandable to   gb  if at all  because of the limitation of ddr  so dimm to a maximum of   gb per module  this means most laptops can only be expanded to a total of    gb of memory  until systems using ddr  memory start becoming available     laptops may have a memory soldered to a motherboard to conserve space  to allow a thinner chassis design  and improve security  if a system is equipped with a trusted platform module  tpm   which requires memory soldering to prevent cold boot attack    soldered memory cannot be upgraded     traditionally laptops had a hard disk drive  hdd  as a main non volatile storage  but it proved inefficient for use in mobile devices due to a high power consumption  heat production and a presence of moving parts  which can cause a damage to both the drive itself and the data stored  when a laptop is unstable physically  e g  during its use while transporting it or after its accidental drop  with the advent of flash memory technology  most mid  to high end laptops opted to a more compact  power efficient and fast solid state drives  ssd   which eliminated a hazard of a drive and data corruption  caused by a laptop physical impacts    in most low end laptops however  hdds are still dominating  due to their significantly lower cost     most laptops use     inch drives  which are a smaller version of a     inch desktop drive form factor      inch hdds are more compact  power efficient and produce less heat  while at the same time have lesser capacity and a data transfer rate  for ssds however  these miniaturization related trade offs are non existent  because ssds  internal parts were initially designed to have very small footprint  some very compact laptops support even smaller     inch hdds  ssds feature a traditional      or     inch or a laptop specific msata or m   card s form factor     ssds have a better data transfer rate  power consumption and a failure rate        compared to hdds  however  the latter have a significantly better cost per capacity and are more spacious  as for       speaking of     inch form factor  maximum single hdd s capacity is   tb  whereas ssds are a   tb maximum     most laptops can contain a single     inch drive  while a small number of laptops with a screen  wider than    inches  can house a pair  some laptops support a hybrid mode  combining a     inch drive  typically a spacious hdd for data  with a msata or m   drive  typically less capacitive  but significantly faster ssd with operating system partition for increasing laptop i o performance  other way to increase performance is to use a smaller ssd of       gb as a cache drive in a compatible os     some laptops may have a very limited drive upgradeability  when ssd have a non standard shape and or require a proprietary daughter card       some laptops have a very limited space on the installed ssd  relying on availability of cloud storage services for a storing of user data  chromebook laptops is a prominent example with this approach     a variety of external hdds or even nas data storage servers  often with a support of a raid technology can be attached to virtually any laptop over such interfaces as usb  firewire  esata  thunderbolt or over the wired or wireless network to further increase a space for a storage of data     most laptops also incorporate a card reader which allows a use of memory cards  typically sd or microsd     cd dvd bd optical disc drive was nearly universal on full sized models  and it remains fairly common for now in laptops with a screen wider  than    inches    xa cm   although the trend towards thinner and lighter machines is gradually eliminating it  it is very uncommon in compact laptops  such as subnotebooks and netbooks  laptop optical drives tend to follow a standard form factor  and usually have a standard msata connector  it is often possible to replace an optical drive with a newer model  in certain laptop models there is a possibility to replace an optical drive with a second hard drive  using a caddy that fills the extra space the optical drive would have occupied     a pointing stick  touchpad or both are used to control the position of the cursor on the screen  and an integrated keyboard is used for typing  an external keyboard and or mouse may be connected using usb port  or wirelessly  e g  via bluetooth  with the advent of ultrabooks and support of touch input by recent operating systems  such as windows      multitouch touchscreen display is a common feature of a modern laptop     on a typical laptop there are several usb ports  an external monitor port  vga  dvi  hdmi or mini displayport   audio in out  often in form of a single socket  are common  it s possible to connect up to three external displays to a modern laptop via a single mini displayport  utilizing a multi stream transport technology       although being common until the end of the     s decade  ethernet network port can be rarely found on a modern laptop  due to overwhelming use of a wireless networking  such as wi fi     legacy ports such as a ps   keyboard mouse port  serial port  parallel port or firewire are increasingly rare  on apple s systems  and on a handful of other laptops  there are also thunderbolt ports     in the past  a pc card  formerly pcmcia  or expresscard slot for expansion cards was often present on laptops to allow adding and removing functionality  even when the laptop is powered on  these are becoming increasingly rare since the introduction of usb      some internal subsystems such as  ethernet  wi fi  or a wireless cellular modem can be implemented as replaceable internal expansion cards  usually accessible under an access cover on the bottom of the laptop  the standards for such cards is pci express  which comes in both mini and even smaller m   sizes  in newer laptops it is not uncommon to also see micro sata  msata  functionality on pci express mini or m   card slots allowing the use of those slots for sata based solid state drives       current laptops utilize lithium ion batteries  with some thinner models using the flatter lithium polymer technology  these two technologies have largely replaced the older nickel metal hydride batteries  battery life is highly variable by model and workload  and can range from one hour to nearly a day  a battery s performance gradually decreases over time  substantial reduction in capacity is typically evident after one to three years of regular use  depending on the charging and discharging pattern and the design of the battery  innovations in laptops and batteries have seen situations which the battery can provide up to    hours of continued operation  assuming average power consumption levels  an example is the hp elitebook     p when used with its ultra capacity battery       laptop s battery is charged using an external power supply  which outputs a dc voltage typically in the range of        volts  the power supply is usually external  and connected to the laptop through a dc connector cable  in most cases it can charge the battery and power the laptop simultaneously  when the battery is fully charged  the laptop continues to run on power supplied by the external power supply  avoiding a battery use  battery charges in a shorter period of time if laptop is turned off or sleeping  the charger typically adds about     grams      xa lb  to the overall transporting weight of a laptop  although some models are substantially heavier or lighter     waste heat from operation is difficult to remove in the compact internal space of a laptop  early laptops used heat sinks placed directly on the components to be cooled  but when these hot components are deep inside the device  a large space wasting air duct is needed to exhaust the heat  modern laptops instead rely on heat pipes to rapidly move waste heat towards the edges of the device  to allow for a much smaller and compact fan and heat sink cooling system  waste heat is usually exhausted away from the device operator  towards the rear or sides of the device  multiple air intake paths are used since some intakes can be blocked  such as when the device is placed on a soft conforming surface like a chair cushion  it is believed that some designs with metal cases  like apple s aluminum macbook pro and macbook air  also employ the case of the machine as a heat sink  allowing it to supplement cooling by dissipating heat out of the device core  secondary device temperature monitoring may reduce performance or trigger an emergency shutdown if it is unable to dissipate heat  such as if the laptop were to be left running and placed inside a carrying case  such a condition has the potential to melt plastics or ignite a fire     aftermarket cooling pads can be used with most laptops to further improve temperature operating conditions     a docking station  sometimes referred to simply as a dock  is a laptop accessory that contains multiple ports  and in some cases also expansion slots and or bays for fixed or removable drives  a laptop connects and disconnects easily to a docking station  typically through a single large proprietary connector     docking station is an especially popular laptop accessory in a corporate computing environment  due to a possibility of a docking station to transform a laptop into a full featured desktop replacement  yet to allow for its easy release  which can be advantageous to road warrior employees     if just more number of existing ports needed  or their position on a laptop is inconvenient  one can use a more cheaper passive device  a port replicator  these devices simply mates to the connectors on the back of the laptop  or connects via a standardized port such as usb or firewire     laptop charging trolleys  also known as laptop trolleys or laptop carts  are mobile storage containers to charge laptops  netbooks and tablet computers all together  the trolleys are predominantly used in schools that have replaced their traditional static ict   suites of desktop computers with laptops  but do not have enough plug sockets in their buildings to charge all of the devices     the trolleys can be wheeled between rooms and classrooms so that anyone in a particular building can access fully charged it   equipment  laptop charging trolleys are also used to deter and protect against opportunistic and organized theft  schools  especially those with open plan designs  are often prime targets for thieves and laptops  netbooks and tablets can easily be concealed and removed from buildings  laptop charging trolleys were designed and constructed to protect against theft  they are generally made out of steel  and the laptops remain locked up while not in use  although the trolleys can be moved between areas in buildings  they can often also be mounted to the floor or walls to prevent thieves walking off with investments  especially overnight       in some laptops  solar panels are able to generate enough solar power for the laptop to operate    the one laptop per child initiative released the olpc xo   laptop which was tested and successfully operated by use of solar panels    presently  they are designing a olpc xo   laptop with these features  the olpc xo   can operate with   watts of electricity because its renewable energy resources generate a total of   watts      samsung has also designed a nc   s solar powered notebook that will be sold commercially in the us market       portability is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop pcs    physical portability allows that a laptop can be used in many places  not only at home and at the office  but also during commuting and flights  in coffee shops  in lecture halls and libraries  at clients  location or at a meeting room  etc  the portability feature offers several distinct advantages     other advantages of laptops     compared to desktop pcs  laptops have disadvantages in the following areas     while the performance of mainstream desktops and laptop is comparable  and the cost of laptops has fallen less rapidly than desktops  laptops remain more expensive than desktop pcs at the same performance level    the upper limits of performance of laptops remain much lower than the highest end desktops  especially  workstation class  machines with two processor sockets   and  bleeding edge  features usually appear first in desktops and only then  as the underlying technology matures  are adapted to laptops     for internet browsing and typical office applications  where the computer spends the majority of its time waiting for the next user input  even relatively low end laptops  such as netbooks  can be fast enough for some users    as of mid       at the lowest end  the cheapest netbooks between us         remain more expensive than the lowest end desktop computers  around us      only when those are priced without a screen monitor  once an inexpensive monitor is added  the prices are comparable     most higher end laptops are sufficiently powerful for high resolution movie playback  some  d gaming and video editing and encoding  however  laptop processors can be disadvantaged when dealing with higher end database  maths  engineering  financial software  virtualization  etc  also  the top of the line mobile graphics processors  gpus  are significantly behind the top of the line desktop gpus to a greater degree than the processors  which limits the utility of laptops for high end  d gaming and scientific visualization applications     some manufacturers work around this performance problem by using desktop cpus for laptops       upgradeability of laptops is very limited compared to desktops  which are thoroughly standardized  in general  hard drives and memory can be upgraded easily  optical drives and internal expansion cards may be upgraded if they follow an industry standard  but all other internal components  including the motherboard  cpu and graphics  are not always intended to be upgradeable  intel  asus  compal  quanta and some other laptop manufacturers have created the common building block standard for laptop parts to address some of the inefficiencies caused by the lack of standards     the reasons for limited upgradeability are both technical and economic  there is no industry wide standard form factor for laptops  each major laptop manufacturer pursues its own proprietary design and construction  with the result that laptops are difficult to upgrade and have high repair costs  with few exceptions  laptop components can rarely be swapped between laptops of competing manufacturers  or even between laptops from the different product lines of the same manufacturer     some upgrades can be performed by adding external devices  either usb or in expansion card format such as pc card  devices such as sound cards  network adapters  hard and optical drives  and numerous other peripherals are available  but these upgrades usually impair the laptop s portability  because they add cables and boxes to the setup and often have to be disconnected and reconnected when the laptop is on the move     because of their small and flat keyboard and trackpad pointing devices  prolonged use of laptops can cause repetitive strain injury    usage of separate  external ergonomic keyboards and pointing devices is recommended to prevent injury when working for long periods of time  they can be connected to a laptop easily by usb or via a docking station  some health standards require ergonomic keyboards at workplaces     the integrated screen often requires users to lean over for a better view  which can cause neck and or spinal injuries  a larger and higher quality external screen can be connected to almost any laptop to alleviate that and to provide additional screen space for more productive work  another solution is to use a computer stand     for anyone not buying a new screen  a simple method to reduce risk of spinal injury is to position the laptop s screen in a manner that an obtuse angle  more than    degrees open  is formed  it is then possible for the neck to remain straight during use of the device     a study by state university of new york researchers found that heat generated from laptops can increase the temperature of the lap of male users when balancing the computer on their lap  potentially putting sperm count at risk  the study  which included roughly two dozen men between the ages of    and     found that the sitting position required to balance a laptop can increase scrotum temperature by as much as    xa  c      xa  f   however  further research is needed to determine whether this directly affects male sterility       a      study of    males published in fertility and sterility found that men who kept their laptops on their laps experienced scrotal hyperthermia  overheating  in which their scrotal temperatures increased by up to  xa  c  the resulting heat increase  which could not be offset by a laptop cushion  may increase male infertility               a common practical solution to this problem is to place the laptop on a table or desk  or to use a book or pillow between the body and the laptop citation needed another solution is to obtain a cooling unit for the laptop  these are usually usb powered and consist of a hard thin plastic case housing one  two or three cooling fansxa   with the entire assembly designed to sit under the laptop in questionxa   which results in the laptop remaining cool to the touch  and greatly reduces laptop heat buildup citation needed    heat generated from using a laptop on the lap can also cause skin discoloration on the thighs known as  toasted skin syndrome              because of their portability  laptops are subject to more wear and physical damage than desktops  components such as screen hinges  latches  power jacks and power cords deteriorate gradually from ordinary use  a liquid spill onto the keyboard  a rather minor mishap with a desktop system  can damage the internals of a laptop and result in a costly repair  one study found that a laptop is three times more likely to break during the first year of use than a desktop       in order to help maintain a laptop  it is recommended to clean a laptop every three months for dirt  debris  dust  and food particles  most cleaning kits consist of a lint free or microfiber cloth for the lcd screen and keyboard  compressed air for getting dust out of the fan  and cleaning solution  it is also important to never use harsh chemicals such as bleach as they can cause damage to the laptop       original external components are expensive  and usually proprietary and non interchangeable  other parts are inexpensive a power jack can cost a few dollars but their replacement may require extensive disassembly and reassembly of the laptop by a technician  other inexpensive but fragile parts often cannot be purchased separate from larger more expensive components    the repair costs of a failed motherboard or lcd panel often exceed the value of a used laptop     laptops rely on extremely compact cooling systems involving a fan and heat sink that can fail from blockage caused by accumulated airborne dust and debris  most laptops do not have any type of removable dust collection filter over the air intake for these cooling systems  resulting in a system that gradually causes it to conduct more heat and noise as the years pass  in some cases the laptop starts to overheat even at idle load levels  this dust is usually stuck inside  where the fan and heat sink meet  where it could not be removed by a casual cleaning and vacuuming  most of the time compressed air can dislodge the dust and debris but may not entirely remove it  after the device is turned on the loose debris is rebuilt back up the cooling system by the fans  a complete disassembly is usually required to clean the laptop entirely  however  preventative maintenance such as regular cleaning of the heat sink via compressed air can prevent dust build up on the heat sink  many laptops are difficult to disassemble by the average user and contain components that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge  esd      battery life is limited because the capacity drops with time  eventually requiring replacement after as little as a year  a new battery typically stores enough energy to run the laptop for three to five hours  depending on usage  configuration  and power management settings  yet  as it ages  the battery s energy storage will dissipate progressively until it lasts only a few minutes  the battery is often easily replaceable and a higher capacity model may be obtained for longer life  some laptops  specifically ultrabooks  do not have the usual removable battery and have to be brought to the service center of its manufacturer to have its battery replaced  replacement batteries can also be expensive     because they are valuable  common  and portable  laptops are prized targets for theft  every day  over       laptops go missing from u s  airports    the cost of stolen business or personal data  and of the resulting problems  identity theft  credit card fraud  breach of privacy   can be many times the value of the stolen laptop itself  consequently  physical protection of laptops and the safeguarding of data contained on them are both of great importance     most laptops have a kensington security slot  which can be used to tether them to a desk or other immovable object with a security cable and lock  in addition  modern operating systems and third party software offer disk encryption functionality  which renders the data on the laptop s hard drive unreadable without a key or a pass phrase  some laptops also now have additional security elements added by the consumer  including eye recognition software and fingerprint scanning components    software such as lojack for laptops  laptop cop  and gadgettrack have been engineered to help victims locate and recover a laptop in the event of theft     in robbins v  lower merion school district  eastern district of pennsylvania        school issued laptops loaded with special software afforded two high schools with the capability to take secret webcam shots of their students at home  via their students  laptops           laptop theft is a serious problem  with fewer than    of lost or stolen laptops ever recovered by the companies that own them    however  that number may decrease due to a variety of companies and software solutions specializing in laptop recovery  for example  lojack for laptops is security software that includes an investigations and theft recovery team made up of ex law enforcement officers who locate and recover stolen laptops  the service utilizes persistent technology  which means it can t be removed or disabled by a thief  lojack can only work to track down a missing laptop when it is turned on and it is connected to the internet  the owner can also remotely delete files or lock their device  so no one can access their personal data     there are a multitude of laptop brands and manufacturers  several major brands  offering notebooks in various classes  are listed in the box to the right     the major brands usually offer good service and support  including well executed documentation and driver downloads that will remain available for many years after a particular laptop model is no longer produced  capitalizing on service  support and brand image  laptops from major brands are more expensive than laptops by smaller brands and odms     some brands are specializing in a particular class of laptops  such as gaming laptops  alienware   high performance laptops  hp envy   netbooks  eeepc  and laptops for children  olpc      many brands  including the major ones  do not design and do not manufacture their laptops  instead  a small number of original design manufacturers  odms  design new models of laptops  and the brands choose the models to be included in their lineup  in         major odms manufactured   of every    laptops in the world  with the largest one  quanta computer  having     of

of the space shuttle program  the first commercial laptop used in space was a macintosh portable in      aboard space shuttle mission sts           mac and other laptop computers continue to be flown aboard manned spaceflights though the only long duration flight certified computer for the international space station is the thinkpad    as of      over     thinkpads were aboard the iss  laptops used aboard the international space station and other spaceflights are generally the same ones that can be purchased by the general public but needed modifications are made to allow them to be used safely and effectively in a weightless environment such as updating the cooling systems to function without relying on hot air rising and accommodation for the lower cabin air pressure       laptops operating in harsh usage environments and conditions  such as strong vibrations  extreme temperatures and wet or dusty conditions differ from those used in space in that they are custom designed for the task and do not use commercial off the shelf hardware     a common accessory for laptops is a laptop sleeve  laptop skin or laptop case  which provides a degree of protection from drops or impacts  sleeves  which are distinguished by being relatively thin and flexible  are most commonly made of neoprene  with sturdier ones made of lrpu  low resilience polyurethane   with some wrapped in ballistic nylon to provide some measure of waterproofing  bulkier and sturdier cases can be made of metal with polyurethane padding inside  and may have locks  for added security     another common accessory is a laptop cooler  this device helps lower the internal temperature of the laptop by using either active or passive methods  a general active method is plugging a laptop cooler into the laptop and using fans to draw heat away from the laptop  a common passive method is just propping the laptop up on some type of pad so it can receive more air flow       features that certain early models of laptops used to have but not available anymore in most recent models of laptops include
