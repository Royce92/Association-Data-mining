consumers  by      it was the most popular software on smartphones in the u s   but quickly dipped in the following years  facing competition from rival oss including ios and android  in february       microsoft announced windows phone to supersede windows mobile  as a result  windows mobile has been deprecated  windows phone is incompatible with windows mobile devices and software     the last version of windows mobile  released after the announcement of windows phone  was        following which microsoft ceased development on windows mobile in order to concentrate on windows phone             most versions of windows mobile have a set of standard features  such as multitasking and the ability to navigate a file system similar to that of windows  x and windows nt  with support for many of the same file types  much like its desktop counterpart  it comes bundled with a set of applications to perform basic tasks  internet explorer mobile is the default web browser and windows media player is the default media player used for playing digital media  microsoft office mobile  the mobile versions of microsoft office  is the default office suite     internet connection sharing  supported on compatible devices  allows the phone to share its internet connection with computers via usb and bluetooth  windows mobile support virtual private networking  vpn  over pptp protocol  most devices with mobile connectivity include a radio interface layer  ril   ril provides the system interface between the cellcore layer within the windows mobile os and the radio protocol stack used by the wireless modem hardware  this allows oems to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment     the user interface has changed much between versions but the basic functionality has remained similar  today screen  later called the home screen  shows the current date  owner information  upcoming appointments  e mail messages  and tasks  taskbar shows the current time and the audio volume and of devices with a cellular radio the signal strength     windows mobile has supported the installation of third party software since the original pocket pc implementations     windows mobile is based on the windows ce kernel and first appeared as the pocket pc      operating system  it is supplied with a suite of basic applications developed with the microsoft windows api  and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of windows  third parties can develop software for windows mobile with no restrictions imposed by microsoft  software applications were purchasable from windows marketplace for mobile during the service s lifespan     most early windows mobile devices came with a stylus  which can be used to enter commands by tapping it on the screen   the primary touch input technology behind most devices were resistive touchscreens which often required a stylus for input  later devices used capacitive sensing which does not require a stylus  along with touchscreens a large variety of form factors existed for the platform  some devices featured slideout keyboards  while others featured minimal face buttons     microsoft s work on handheld portable devices began with research projects in       two years later work on windows ce officially began   initially the os and the user interface were developed separately  with windows ce being based on windows    code and a separate team handing the user interface which was codenamed winpad  later microsoft at work for handhelds    windows    had strong pen support making porting easy  with some saying  at this time  windows    offers outstanding pen support  it is treating pens right for the first time    winpad was delayed due to price and performance issues   before being scrapped in early      due to touchscreen driver problems relating to writetouch technology  made by ncr microelectronic products   although winpad was never released as a consumer product  alpha builds were released showcasing many interface elements    during development of winpad a separate team worked on a project called pulsar  designed to be a mobile communications version of winpad  described as a  pager on steroids    this project was also canceled around the same time as winpad  the two disbanded groups would form the pegasus project in       pegasus would work on the hardware side of the windows ce os  attempting to create a form factor similar to a pc esque pda like winpad  with communications functionality like pulsar  a hardware reference guide was created and devices began shipping in       although most of these device bore little resemblance to the goal of a pen based touchscreen handheld device       pocket pc       originally codenamed  rapier     was released on april           and was based on windows ce      it was the debut of what was later dubbed the windows mobile operating system  and meant to be a successor to the operating system aboard palm size pcs  backwards compatibility was retained with such palm size pc applications  pocket pc      was intended mainly for pocket pc devices  however several palm size pc devices had the ability to be updated also  further  several pocket pc      phones were released  however microsoft s  smartphone  hardware platform was not yet created  the only resolution supported by this release was     x      qvga   removable storage card formats that were supported were compactflash and multimediacard  at this time pocket pc devices had not been standardized with a specific cpu architecture  as a result  pocket pc      was released on multiple cpu architectures  sh    mips  and arm  infrared  ir  file beaming capability was among the original hardware features     the original pocket pc operating system had similar appearance to windows     windows me  and windows      operating systems  pocket pc      is unsupported as of september              this initial release had multiple built in applications    many of them similarly branded to match their desktop counterparts  such as microsoft reader  microsoft money  pocket internet explorer and windows media player  a version of microsoft office called pocket office was also bundled and included pocket word  pocket excel and pocket outlook  notes  a note taking app saw its first release and would be supported by most later versions of windows mobile  intelligent character recognition support allowed notes to distinguish styles of handwriting to be learned by the os during processing to improve accuracy and recognition levels     pocket pc       originally codenamed  merlin     was released in october       like pocket pc       it was powered by windows ce      although targeted mainly for            qvga  pocket pc devices  pocket pc      was also used for pocket pc phones  and for the first time  smartphones    these pocket pc      smartphones were mainly gsm devices  with future releases  the pocket pc and smartphone lines would increasingly collide as the licensing terms were relaxed allowing oems to take advantage of more innovative  individual design ideas  aesthetically  pocket pc      was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released windows xp  newly added or updated programs include         windows media player   with streaming capability  msn messenger  and microsoft reader    with digital rights management support  upgrades to the bundled version of office mobile include a spell checker and word count tool in pocket word and improved pocket outlook  connectivity was improved with file beaming on non microsoft devices such as palm os  the inclusion of terminal services and virtual private networking support  and the ability to synchronize folders  other upgrades include an enhanced

following    enhanced pocket outlook with vcard and vcal support  improved pocket internet explorer and sms reply options for phone edition     windows mobile      second edition  also known as  windows mobile      se   was released on march          and first offered on the dell axim x    this was the last version which allowed users to back up and restore an entire device through activesync     this upgrade allows users to switch between portrait and landscape modes and introduces a single column layout in pocket internet explorer  to make wireless internet access more secure wi fi protected access  wpa  support was added  an array of new screen resolutions also debuted vga               x     and    x     to increase visual clarity and the range of form factors windows mobile could run on     windows mobile      originally codenamed  magneto     was released at microsoft s mobile and embedded developers conference      in las vegas  may             microsoft offered mainstream support for windows mobile   through october           and extended support through october             it was first offered on the dell axim x    it used the  net compact framework     sp   an environment for programs based on  net  windows mobile     included microsoft exchange server  push  functionality improvements that worked with exchange      sp     the  push  functionality also required vendor device support   with aku  software upgrades all wm     devices supported directpush  this version featured increased battery life due to persistent storage capability  previously up to      enough for    hours of storage  of battery power was reserved just to maintain data in volatile ram  this continued the trend of windows based devices moving from using ram as their primary storage medium to the use of a combination of ram and flash memory  in use  no distinction between the two is obvious to users   programs and frequently accessed data run in ram  while most storage is in the flash memory  the os seamlessly moves data between the two as needed  everything is backed up in the flash memory  so unlike prior devices  wm  devices lose no data if power is lost  new to      os updates were released as adaptation kit upgrades  with aku     being the final released     a new version of office known as microsoft office mobile was included  which includes powerpoint mobile  excel mobile with graphing capability and word mobile with the ability to insert tables and graphics  media management and playback was enhanced with picture and video package  which converged the

desktop and server windows systems  caller id now supports photos so a user can apply an image to each contact to show when a call is received  directshow was also natively added  this release was the first to include directdraw with hardware acceleration  replacing the deprecated graphics component of gapi       windows mobile     requires at least    mbs of rom  it s advisable to have    mbs of ram   and the device must run an arm compatible processor such as the intel xscale or the samsung and texas instruments arm compatibles       windows mobile    formerly codenamed  crossbow     was released on february            at the  gsm world congress       it comes in three different versions   windows mobile   standard  for smartphones  phones without touchscreens    windows mobile   professional  for pocket pcs with phone functionality  and  windows mobile   classic  for pocket pcs without cellular radios       windows mobile   is powered by windows ce      version      and is strongly linked to the then newly introduced windows live   and exchange      products  windows mobile   standard was first offered on the orange s spv e       while windows mobile   professional was first offered on the o  s xda terra    aesthetically  windows mobile   was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released windows vista  functionally  it works much like windows mobile    but with much better stability     along with the announcement of office mobile       with support for office      document formats  pptx  docx  xlsx   onenote mobile  a companion to microsoft office onenote was added to the already installed version  in addition to the newly included programs with office mobile improvements were made to existing applications  such as html email support in outlook mobile  a large number of windows mobile users are enterprise users business environments were targeted  with server search on microsoft exchange       out of office replies with microsoft exchange       and search ability for contacts in an exchange server address book being implemented  to aid development for programmers   net compact framework v  sp  is now preinstalled with the os  developers and users also have access to microsoft sql server      compact edition for storage and retrieval of information  ajax  javascript  and xmldom support were added to internet explorer mobile along with improved devicewide internet sharing  communication abilities were further enhanced with a new microsoft bluetooth stack and voip  internet calling  support with aec  acoustic echo cancelling  and msrt audio codec     to improve security microsoft added storage card encryption so that encryption keys are lost if device is cold booted  further updates both  security and feature  can now also be

access  uma  support for select operators    windows mobile     was announced april          it is a minor upgrade to the windows mobile   platform with various performance enhancements and a redesigned home screen featuring horizontal tiles that expand on clicking to display more information  although this new home screen is featured only on windows mobile standard edition  this was not supported in the professional edition    several other changes such as threaded sms  full page zooming in internet explorer and  domain enroll  were also added  along with a  mobile  version of the microsoft onenote program and an interactive  getting started  wizard  domain enroll is functionality to connect the device to system center mobile device manager       a product to manage mobile devices    the most apparent of the other differences is that the standard version  like prior versions  still creates automatic links for telephone numbers in tasks and appointments  which allows for the easier click and dial of stored telephone numbers within these outlook items  this feature is not supported in the professional version  windows mobile     also had improved bandwidth efficiency in its push email protocol  activesync  of  up to         this considerably improved battery life in many devices     aside from the visual and feature distinctions  the underlying ce versions can be used to differentiate wm    from wm      the version of windows ce in wm     is        with the final number being a   digit build id  e g           on htc wing   in wm      the ce version is

released windows mobile    later canceled in favor of windows phone     that arrived in       it was never part of microsoft s mobile phone roadmap  and has been described by its chief executive  steve ballmer  as  not the full release microsoft wanted  until the multi touch enabled windows mobile    now replaced by windows phone  arrived in         ballmer also indicated that the company  screwed up with windows mobile   he lamented that windows mobile   was not yet available and that the windows mobile team needed to try to recoup losses    microsoft unveiled this version at the      mobile world congress in february    and several devices were supplied with it    it was released to manufacturers on may           the first devices running the operating system appeared in late october         several phones that officially shipped with windows mobile     can be officially updated to windows mobile        this update includes some significant new added features  such as a revamped gui  a new today screen resembling that of microsoft s zune player with vertically scrollable labels  called  titanium      wm    also includes the new internet explorer mobile   browser

  while  skymarket  has been confirmed as windows marketplace for mobile    this version was designed mainly for easier finger usage    some reviewers have noted interface inconsistencies  with some applications having small buttons making them harder to operate using only a finger    whilst this version of windows mobile does not natively support capacitive screens  mobile manufacturers have been able to use them on their devices      in the months following this release  development shifted from windows mobile to its successor windows phone  as such no major upgrades were planned or released  although three minor updates               and        were made to satisfy consumers during the transition period        brings larger user interface elements    including icon based soft buttons  rather than text based     an updated contacts app    native support for a gps    improved threaded text messaging    and performance improvements    it was unofficially ported to several windows mobile phones       the second minor update was announced on february          along with the sony ericsson aspen which was the first phone to use this version          continues the trend of attempting to provide a more finger friendly user interface with several new usability features such as native support for multitouch  although device maker htc corporation created proprietary work arounds to allow multi touch to work on some applications it installed on its hd  handset however  microsoft applications on this handset  such as the internet explorer web browser  did not support multi touch     and drag and drop start menu icons  touchable tiles replaced soft keys     internet explorer mobile   has also received some major updates including decreased page load time  improved memory management and gesture smoothing    as with other updates it was unofficially ported to some other devices  additional features include threaded email and office mobile            the last minor update and the last released version is        it first leaked in january       and was unofficially ported to some windows mobile phones    the name windows mobile       has been applied to these newer builds  although this name remained unconfirmed by microsoft     there are three main versions of windows mobile for various hardware devices       windows mobile for automotive and windows mobile software for portable media centers are among some specialty versions of the platform     microsoft had over    handset partners    when windows mobile was still being shipped on new devices      of the    million windows mobile devices that were made from launch to february      were built by one contract manufacturing group  htc  which makes handsets for several major companies under their brands  and under its own brand       on january           microsoft announced windows embedded handheld      the operating system has compatibility with windows mobile     and is presented as an enterprise handheld device  targeting retailers  delivery companies  and other companies that rely on handheld computing  unlike windows phone  windows embedded handheld retains backward compatibility with legacy windows mobile applications       pocket pcs and personal digital assistants were originally the intended platform for windows mobile  these were grouped into two main categories  devices that lacked mobile phone capabilities  and those that included it  beginning with version   devices with this functionality ran  windows mobile   professional  and those that lacked it ran  windows mobile   classic   microsoft had described these devices as  a handheld device that enables you to store and retrieve e mail  contacts  appointments  play multimedia files  games  exchange text messages with msn messenger  browse the web  and more     from a technical standpoint microsoft also specified various hardware and software requirements such as the inclusion of a touchscreen and a directional pad or touchpad     smartphones were the second hardware platform after pocket pc to run windows mobile  and debuted with the release of pocket pc       although in the broad sense of the term  smartphone   both pocket pc phones and microsoft branded smartphones each fit into this category  it should be noted that microsoft s use of the term  smartphone  includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from pocket pc phones  such smartphones were originally designed without touchscreens  intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand  and typically had lower display resolution than pocket pcs  microsoft s focus for the smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner       windows mobile s share of the smartphone market grew from its inception while new devices were being released  after peaking in         it saw decline year on year     in q        windows mobile accounted for     of worldwide smartphone sales    windows mobile was projected to overtake symbian to become the leading mobile os by            in q       microsoft shipped     million pdas  which increased to     million in the same quarter the following year    windows mobile saw year over year growth between           of       which according to gartner  helped windows mobile to solidify its stronghold on the market        but by       its share had dropped to        microsoft licensed windows mobile to four out of the world s five largest mobile phone manufacturers  with nokia being the exception       gartner research data showed that while the total smartphone industry grew     between      and       windows mobile s share of the smartphone market fell      in that same period    it also   decreased by     in q          at one time windows mobile was the most popular handset for business use citation needed but by      this was no longer the case      of planned business deployments of mobile application were for windows mobile  putting it in  rd place  behind blackberry       and iphone             in february      microsoft signed a deal with the third largest mobile phone maker  lg electronics  to license windows mobile os on    upcoming lg smartphone models    but in september       palm  inc  announced it would drop windows mobile from its smartphone line up    gartner estimated that by the third quarter of      windows mobile s share of worldwide smartphone sales was         by august       it was the least popular smartphone operating system  with a    share of the worldwide smartphone market  after symbian  blackberry os  android and ios     an october      report in digitimes said that acer will shift its focus from windows mobile to google android    the new york times reported in      that windows mobile  is foundering   as cellphone makers desert it in favor of google s android phone platform    it cited the difficulties in microsoft s business model  which involves charging handset manufacturers up to     for each copy of windows mobile  while rival google gives away android for free    from late      analysts and media reports began to express concerns about the future viability of the windows mobile platform  and whether microsoft would keep supporting it into the future        samsung announced in november      that it would phase out the windows mobile platform    to concentrate on its own bada operating system  google s android  and microsoft s windows phone       software may be developed by third parties for the windows mobile operating system  developers have several options for deploying mobile applications  these include writing native code with visual c    managed code that works with the  net compact framework  writing code in tcl tk with etcl    gcc using cegcc    python using pythonce or server side code that can be deployed using internet explorer mobile or a mobile client on a user s device  the  net compact framework is a subset of the  net framework and hence shares many components with software development on desktop clients  application servers  and web servers which have the  net framework installed  thus integrating networked computing space       to aid developers microsoft released software development kits  sdks  that work in conjunction with their visual studio development environment  these sdks include emulator images for developers to test and debug their applications while writing them  software can be tested on a client machine directly or be downloaded to a device  microsoft also distributes visual studio             professional editions  and server   database counterparts to students as downloads free of charge via its dreamspark program    third party integrated development environments can also be used to write software such as lazarus  resco mobileforms toolkit    lexico  ns basic and basic ppc  some third party development environments allow coding to be done on the device itself without the need for a computer       developer communities have used the sdk to port later versions of windows mobile os to older devices and making the os images available for free  thus providing the devices with the current feature set  microsoft has tolerated this procedure for some time but decided in february      to ask developers to take their os images off the net  which in turn raised discussions    at the same time microsoft offered upgrades to windows mobile   versions to manufacturers for free       windows mobile applications are strongly encouraged to be optimized for touch screen user interfaces  the developer also needs to take into the account the lower cpu performance of older devices     on july          microsoft opened a third party application distribution service called windows marketplace for mobile     in       windows marketplace for mobile stopped accepting new admissions     and then fully closed on may              in the early years of windows mobile devices were able to be managed and synced from a remote computer using activesync  a data synchronization technology and protocol developed by microsoft  originally released in       this allowed servers running microsoft exchange server  or other third party variants  to act as a personal information manager and share information such as email  calendar appointments  contacts or internet favorites     with the release of windows vista  activesync was replaced with windows mobile device center  device center is included with vista and windows   and contains the same functionality of its predecessor  this new version provides many front end enhancements  allowing a home user to sync pim information with microsoft outlook      and later  photos from windows photo gallery  videos or music from windows media player and favorites with internet explorer  without the need for a server back end  devices at this time also included a base driver compatible with mobile device center so a user can connect to a computer without a need for any configuration
