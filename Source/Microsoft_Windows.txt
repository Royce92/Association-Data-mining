 microsoft windows  or simply windows  is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed  marketed  and sold by microsoft  it consists of several families of operating systems  each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry  active windows families include windows nt  windows embedded and windows phone  these may encompass subfamilies  e g  windows embedded compact  windows ce  or windows server  defunct windows families include windows  x and windows mobile     microsoft introduced an operating environment named windows on november          as a graphical operating system shell for ms dos in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces  guis    microsoft windows came to dominate the world s personal computer market with over     market share  overtaking mac os  which had been introduced in       however  since       it sells less than android  which became the most popular operating system in       when counting all of the computing platforms windows runs on  same as android   in       the number of windows device sold were less than     of android devices sold     as of april     update  the most recent versions of windows for personal computers  smartphones  server computers and embedded devices are respectively windows      windows phone      windows server      r  and windows embedded    a specialized version of windows runs on the xbox one game console     the next version of windows is windows    and is currently available as a technical preview  it is set for release for phones  tablets  laptops  and pcs in late                  microsoft  the developer of windows  has registered several trademarks each of which denote a family of windows operating systems that target a specific sector of the computing industry  as of       the following windows families are being actively developed     the following windows families are no longer being developed     the term windows collectively describes any or all of several generations of microsoft operating system products  these products are generally categorized as follows     the history of windows dates back to september       when chase bishop  a computer scientist  designed the first model of an electronic device and project  interface manager  was started  it was announced in november       after the apple lisa  but before the macintosh  under the name  windows   but windows     was not released until november        windows     was to compete with apple s operating system  but achieved little popularity  windows     is not a complete operating system  rather  it extends ms dos  the shell of windows     is a program known as the ms dos executive  components included calculator  calendar  cardfile  clipboard viewer  clock  control panel  notepad  paint  reversi  terminal and write  windows     does not allow overlapping windows  instead all windows are tiled  only modal dialog boxes may appear over other windows     windows     was released in december      and was more popular than its predecessor  it features several improvements to the user interface and memory management citation needed windows      changed the os from tiled windows to overlapping windows  the result of this change led to apple computer filing a suit against microsoft alleging infringement on apple s copyrights      windows     also introduced more sophisticated keyboard shortcuts and could make use of expanded memory     windows     was released in two different versions  windows     and windows      windows     uses the virtual      mode of intel       to multitask several dos programs and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory using available extended memory  windows      in spite of its name  runs on both intel      and intel       processors  it runs in real mode but can make use of the high memory area     in addition to full windows packages  there were runtime only versions that shipped with early windows software from third parties and made it possible to run their windows software on ms dos and without the full windows feature set     the early versions of windows are often thought of as graphical shells  mostly because they ran on top of ms dos and use it for file system services    however  even the earliest windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions  notably  having their own executable file format and providing their own device drivers  timer  graphics  printer  mouse  keyboard and sound   unlike ms dos  windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time  through cooperative multitasking  windows implemented an elaborate  segment based  software virtual memory scheme  which allows it to run applications larger than available memory  code segments and resources are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce  data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control     windows      released in       improved the design  mostly because of virtual memory and loadable virtual device drivers  vxds  that allow windows to share arbitrary devices between multi tasked dos applications citation needed windows     applications can run in protected mode  which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme  they run inside the same address space  where the segmented memory provides a degree of protection  windows     also featured improvements to the user interface  microsoft rewrote critical operations from c into assembly  windows     is the first microsoft windows version to achieve broad commercial success  selling   million copies in the first six months         windows      made generally available on march          featured a facelift  in august       windows for workgroups  a special version with integrated peer to peer networking features and a version number of       was released  it was sold along windows      support for windows     ended on december                the next major consumer oriented release of windows  windows     was released on august           while still remaining ms dos based  windows    introduced support for native    bit applications  plug and play hardware  preemptive multitasking  long file names of up to     characters  and provided increased stability over its predecessors  windows    also introduced a redesigned  object oriented user interface  replacing the previous program manager with the start menu  taskbar  and windows explorer shell  windows    was a major commercial success for microsoft  ina fried of cnet remarked that  by the time windows    was finally ushered off the market in       it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world     microsoft published four oem service releases  osr  of windows     each of which was roughly equivalent to a service pack  the first osr of windows    was also the first version of windows to be bundled with microsoft s web browser  internet explorer    mainstream support for windows    ended on december          and extended support for windows    ended on december                windows    was followed up with the release of windows    on june           which introduced the windows driver model  support for usb composite devices  support for acpi  hibernation  and support for multi monitor configurations  windows    also included integration with internet explorer   through active desktop and other aspects of the windows desktop update  a series of enhancements to the explorer shell which were also made available for windows      in may       microsoft released windows    second edition  an updated version of windows     windows    se added internet explorer     and windows media player     amongst other upgrades  mainstream support for windows    ended on june          and extended support for windows    ended on july                on september           microsoft released windows me  millennium edition   the last dos based version of windows  windows me incorporated visual interface enhancements from its windows nt based counterpart windows       had faster boot times than previous versions  which however  required the removal of the ability to access a real mode dos environment  removing compatibility with some older programs     expanded multimedia functionality  including windows media player    windows movie maker  and the windows image acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras   additional system utilities such as system file protection and system restore  and updated home networking tools    however  windows me was faced with criticism for its speed and instability  along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode dos support  pc world considered windows me to be one of the worst operating systems microsoft had ever released  and the  th worst tech product of all time      in november       a new development team within microsoft  which included former digital equipment corporation developers dave cutler and mark lucovsky  began work on a revamped version of ibm and microsoft s os   operating system known as  nt os     nt os   was intended to be a secure  multi user operating system with posix compatibility and a modular  portable kernel with preemptive multitasking and support for multiple processor architectures  however  following the successful release of windows      the nt development team decided to rework the project to use an extended    bit port of the windows api known as win   instead of those of os    win   maintained a similar structure to the windows apis  allowing existing windows applications to easily be ported to the platform   but also supported the capabilities of the existing nt kernel  following its approval by microsoft s staff  development continued on what was now windows nt  the first    bit version of windows  however  ibm objected to the changes  and ultimately continued os   development on its own         the first release of the resulting operating system  windows nt      named to associate it with windows      was released in july      with versions for desktop workstations and servers  windows nt     was released in september       focusing on performance improvements and support for novell s netware  and was followed up by windows nt      in may       which included additional improvements and support for the powerpc architecture  windows nt     was released in june       introducing the redesigned interface of windows    to the nt series  on february           microsoft released windows       a successor to nt      the windows nt name was dropped at this point in order to put a greater focus on the windows brand       the next major version of windows  windows xp  was released on october           the introduction of windows xp aimed to unify the consumer oriented windows  x series with the architecture introduced by windows nt  a change which microsoft promised would provide better performance over its dos based predecessors  windows xp would also introduce a redesigned user interface  including an updated start menu and a  task oriented  windows explorer   streamlined multimedia and networking features  internet explorer    integration with microsoft s  net passport services  modes to help provide compatibility with software designed for previous versions of windows  and remote assistance functionality       at retail  windows xp was now marketed in two main editions  the  home  edition was targeted towards consumers  while the  professional  edition was targeted towards business environments and power users  and included additional security and networking features  home and professional were later accompanied by the  media center  edition  designed for home theater pcs  with an emphasis on support for dvd playback  tv tuner cards  dvr functionality  and remote controls   and the  tablet pc  edition  designed for mobile devices meeting its specifications for a tablet computer  with support for stylus pen input and additional pen enabled applications         mainstream support for windows xp ended on april           extended support ended on april               after windows       microsoft also changed its release schedules for server operating systems  the server counterpart of windows xp  windows server       was released in april         it was followed in december      by windows server      r      after a lengthy development process  windows vista was released on november          for volume licensing and january          for consumers  it contained a number of new features  from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes  with a particular focus on security features  it was available in a number of different editions  and has been subject to some criticism  vista s server counterpart  windows server      was released in early          on july           windows   and windows server      r  were released as rtm  release to manufacturing  while the former was released to the public   months later on october           unlike its predecessor  windows vista  which introduced a large number of new features  windows   was intended to be a more focused  incremental upgrade to the windows line  with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which windows vista was already compatible    windows   has multi touch support  a redesigned windows shell with an updated taskbar  a home networking system called homegroup    and performance improvements     windows    the successor to windows    was released generally on october           a number of significant changes were made on windows    including the introduction of a user interface based around microsoft s metro design language with optimizations for touch based devices such as tablets and all in one pcs  these changes include the start screen  which uses large tiles that are more convenient for touch interactions and allow for the display of continually updated information  and a new class of apps which are designed primarily for use on touch based devices  other changes include increased integration with cloud services and other online platforms  such as social networks and microsoft s own skydrive and xbox live services   the windows store service for software distribution  and a new variant known as windows rt for use on devices that utilize the arm architecture              an update to windows    called windows      was released on october           and includes features such as new live tile sizes  deeper skydrive integration  and many other revisions       on september           microsoft announced windows    as the successor to windows      it will be released in late      and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with windows    changes include the return of the start menu  a virtual desktop system  and the ability to run windows store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full screen mode       multilingual support is built into windows  the language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the region and language control panel  components for all supported input languages  such as input method editors  are automatically installed during windows installation  in windows xp and earlier  files for east asian languages  such as chinese  and right to left scripts  such as arabic  may need to be installed separately  also from the said control panel   third party imes may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs     interface languages for the operating system are free for download  but some languages are limited to certain editions of windows  language interface packs  lips  are redistributable and may be downloaded from microsoft s download center and installed for any edition of windows  xp or later    they translate most  but not all  of the windows interface  and require a certain base language  the language which windows originally shipped with   this is used for most languages in emerging markets  full language packs  which translates the complete operating system  are only available for specific editions of windows  ultimate and enterprise editions of windows vista and    and all editions of windows        and rt except single language   they do not require a specific base language  and are commonly used for more popular languages such as french or chinese  these languages cannot be downloaded through the download center  but available as optional updates through the windows update service  except windows        the interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the windows interface language  availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves     windows   and windows server      introduces a new language control panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed  and language packs  regardless of type  can be downloaded from a central location  the pc settings app in windows     and windows server      r  also includes a counterpart settings page for this  changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled windows store apps  such as mail  maps and news  and certain other microsoft developed apps  such as remote desktop   the above limitations for language packs are however still in effect  except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except single language  which caters to emerging markets     windows nt included support for several different platforms before the x   based personal computer became dominant in the professional world  windows nt     and its predecessors supported powerpc  dec alpha and mips r       although some these platforms implement    bit computing  the operating system treated them as    bit   however  windows       the successor of windows nt      dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x    known as ia     or newer in    bit mode  the client line of window nt family still runs on ia     although the windows server line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of windows server      r      with the introduction of the intel itanium architecture  ia      microsoft released new versions of windows to support it  itanium versions of windows xp and windows server      were released at the same time as their mainstream x   counterparts  windows xp    bit edition  released in       is the last windows client operating systems to support itanium  windows server line continued to support this platform until windows server       windows server      r  is the last windows operating system to support itanium architecture     on april           microsoft released windows xp professional x   edition and windows server      x   editions to support the x       or simply x     the eighth generation of x   architecture  windows vista was the first client version of windows nt to be released simultaneously in ia    and x   editions  x   is still supported     an edition of windows   known as windows rt was specifically created for computers with arm architecture     windows ce  officially known as windows embedded compact   is an edition of windows that runs on minimalistic computers  like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones  windows embedded compact is based on its own dedicated kernel  dubbed windows ce kernel  microsoft licenses windows ce to oems and device makers  the oems and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences  while windows ce provides the technical foundation to do so     windows ce was used in the dreamcast along with sega s own proprietary os for the console  windows ce was the core from which windows mobile was derived  its successor  windows phone    was based on components from both windows ce     r  and windows ce      windows phone   however  is based on the same nt kernel as windows       windows embedded compact is not to be confused with windows xp embedded or windows nt     embedded  modular editions of windows based on windows nt kernel     xbox os is an unofficial name given to the version of windows that runs on the xbox one    it is a more specific implementation with an emphasis on virtualization  using hyper v  as it is three operating systems running at once  consisting of the core operating system  a second implemented for games and a more windows like environment for applications       nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn    according to gartner  windows  including all platforms  sold less than a quarter of android  the so called mobile operating system  in         and has been outsold every year since       android runs on tablets   personal computers    smartphones  and traditional pcs but few users do   in       android based devices outsold windows             in mature markets  or by     million units  estimating the gap to widen much in      as it did in                 strategy analytics estimates the installed base of desktop and mobile pcs  windows is mostly used on those  to about      million at best    they also estimate the overall tablet installed base to be already of comparable size to the pc market and predict tablets will have surpassed them by       most of the tablet installed base consists of android based devices that add to the following android smartphone numbers  to put strategy analytics estimates in context  by statistica s estimate  android smartphones have an installed base  in       of      million androids smartphones      of the estimated     billion          android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system  in fact of any os including  non mobile  ones   as of     update  devices running it also sell more than windows  ios and mac os x devices combined  in the third quarter of       android s share of the global smartphone shipment market was            an estimated three billion android smartphones only have been sold by the end of          unlike android  programs may not work across different versions of windows  but that is planned in windows        consumer versions of windows were originally designed for ease of use on a single user pc without a network connection  and did not have security features built in from the outset    however  windows nt and its successors are designed for security  including on a network  and multi user pcs  but were not initially designed with internet security in mind as much  since  when it was first developed in the early     s  internet use was less prevalent       these design issues combined with programming errors  e g  buffer overflows  and the popularity of windows means that it is a frequent target of computer worm and virus writers  in june       bruce schneier s counterpane internet security reported that it had seen over       new viruses and worms in the previous six months    in       kaspersky lab found around        malicious programs viruses  trojans  back doors  and exploits written for windows       microsoft releases security patches through its windows update service approximately once a month  usually the second tuesday of the month   although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary    in versions of windows after and including windows      sp  and windows xp  updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so  as a result  service pack   for windows xp  as well as service pack   for windows server       were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise might have been       while the windows  x series offered the option of having profiles for multiple users  they had no concept of access privileges  and did not allow concurrent access  and so were not true multi user operating systems  in addition  they implemented only partial memory protection  they were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security     the windows nt series of operating systems  by contrast  are true multi user  and implement absolute memory protection  however  a lot of the advantages of being a true multi user operating system were nullified by the fact that  prior to windows vista  the first user account created during the setup process was an administrator account  which was also the default for new accounts  though windows xp did have limited accounts  the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rightsxa   partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rightsxa   and so most home users ran as administrator all the time     windows vista changes this   by introducing a privilege elevation system called user account control  when logging in as a standard user  a logon session is created and a token containing only the most basic privileges is assigned  in this way  the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system  when logging in as a user in the administrators group  two separate tokens are assigned  the first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator  and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive  user applications  including the windows shell  are then started with the restricted token  resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an administrator account  when an application requests higher privileges or  run as administrator  is clicked  uac will prompt for confirmation and  if consent is given  including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group   start the process using the unrestricted token       all windows versions from windows nt   have been based on a file system permission system referred to as aglp  accounts  global  local  permissions  agdlp which in essence where file permissions are applied to the file folder in the form of a  local group  which then has other  global groups  as members  these global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different windows versions used  this system varies from other vendor products such as linux and netware due to the  static  allocation of permission being applied directory to the file or folder  however using this process of aglp agdlp agudlp allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders     on january          microsoft released a beta version of microsoft antispyware  based upon the previously released giant antispyware  on february           microsoft antispyware became windows defender with the release of beta    windows defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software  windows xp and windows server      users who have genuine copies of microsoft windows can freely download the program from microsoft s web site  and windows defender ships as part of windows vista and      in windows    windows defender and microsoft security essentials have been combined into a single program  named windows defender  it is based on microsoft security essentials  borrowing its features and user interface  although it is enabled by default  it can be turned off to use another anti virus solution    windows malicious software removal tool and the optional microsoft safety scanner are two other free security products offered by microsoft     in an article based on a report by symantec    internetnews com has described microsoft windows as having the  fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of             a study conducted by kevin mitnick and marketing communications firm avantgarde in      found that an unprotected and unpatched windows xp system with service pack   lasted only   minutes on the internet before it was compromised  and an unprotected and also unpatched windows server      system was compromised after being connected to the internet for   hours    this study does not apply to windows xp systems running the service pack   update  released in late        which vastly improved the security of windows xp citation needed the computer that was running windows xp service pack   was not compromised  the aol national cyber security alliance online safety study of october      determined that     of windows users were infected by at least one spyware adware product citation needed much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of microsoft windows products  typical suggestions include deploying microsoft windows behind a hardware or software firewall  running anti virus and anti spyware software  and installing patches as they become available through windows update       owing to the operating system s popularity  a number of applications have been released that aim to provide compatibility with windows applications  either as a compatibility layer for another operating system  or as a standalone system that can run software written for windows out of the box  these include
