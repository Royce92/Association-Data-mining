 a graphing calculator  also graphics   graphic calculator  is a handheld calculator that is capable of plotting graphs  solving simultaneous equations  and performing other tasks with variables  most popular graphing calculators are also programmable  allowing the user to create customized programs  typically for scientific engineering and education applications  because they have large displays  graphing calculators can also typically display several lines of text and calculations at the same time             casio produced the first commercially available graphing calculator  the fx     g  in       after casio  hewlett packard followed shortly in the form of the hp   c   this was followed by the hp   s         hp   sx         hp   s         and many other models  models like the hp   g        feature a computer algebra system  cas  capable of manipulating symbolic expressions and analytic solving  an unusual and powerful cas  calculator  is the now obsolete year      casio cassiopeia a    and a     flip top  stylus operated pdas  which ran the maple v symbolic engine  the hp    and     ranges were primarily meant for the professional science engineering markets  the hp          were sold in the high school college educational market  while the hp    series cater to both educational and professional customers of all levels  the hp series of graphing calculators is best known for its reverse polish notation  rpn    reverse polish lisp  rpl  interface  although the hp   g introduced a standard expression entry interface as well     texas instruments has produced graphing calculators since       the oldest of which was the ti     some of the newer calculators are similar  with the addition of more memory  faster processors  and usb connection such as the ti     ti    series  and ti    series  other models  designed to be appropriate for students       years of age  are the ti    and ti     other ti graphing calculators have been designed to be appropriate for calculus  namely the ti     ti     ti    series  and ti    series  ti     ti    plus  and voyage       ti offers a cas on the ti     ti nspire cas and ti    series models with the ti    series featuring a qwerty keypad  ti calculators are targeted specifically to the educational market  but are also widely available to the general public     graphing calculators are also manufactured by sharp but they do not have the online communities  user websites and collections of programs like the other brands     some graphing calculators have a computer algebra system  cas   which means that they are capable of producing symbolic results  these calculators can manipulate algebraic expressions  performing operations such as factor  expand  and simplify  in addition  they can give answers in exact form without numerical approximations   calculators that have a computer algebra system are called symbolic or cas calculators  examples of symbolic calculators include the hp   g  the ti nspire cas  the ti     and the casio classpad     many graphing calculators can be attached to devices like electronic thermometers  ph gauges  weather instruments  decibel and light meters  accelerometers  and other sensors and therefore function as data loggers  as well as wifi or other communication modules for monitoring  polling and interaction with the teacher  student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning of math  especially statistics and mechanics     since graphing calculators are usually readily user programmable  such calculators are also widely used for gaming purposes  with a sizable body of user created game software on most popular platforms  even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range  graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games  however  for developers and advanced users like researchers  analysts and gamers   rd party software development involving firmware mods  whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language  is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school and college tests where these devices are targeted  nowadays graduate  masters  students and researchers have turned to advanced computer aided math software for learning as well as experimenting     some graphing calculators are capable of color output and feature animated and interactive drawing of math plots   d and  d   other figures such as animated algebra theorems  preparation of documents which can include these plots and drawings  etc  some calculator manufacturers also offer computer software for emulating and working with handheld graphing calculators     most graphing calculators  as well as some non graphing scientific and programmer s calculators can be programmed to automate complex and frequently used series of calculations and those inaccessible from the keyboard     the actual programming can often be done on a computer then later uploaded to the calculators  the most common tools for this include the pc link cable and software for the given calculator  configurable text editors or hex editors  and specialized programming tools such as the below mentioned implementation of various languages on the computer side     earlier calculators stored programs on magnetic cards and the like  increased memory capacity has made storage on the calculator the most common implementation  some of the newer machines can also use memory cards     many calculators  such as earlier ti graphing and scientific calculators will tokenize the code for a program or function  using iso      type character codes for the statements and other programming elements  the ti    plus and many hp calculators read the code much like computers do and they have functions such as chr   chr  char  asc  and the like in basic  sometimes renamed  in addition to using somewhat modified or unmodified versions of   bit    bit or   bit iso      derived character sets and other character sets running from values of   to       x  f         x ff   or       x ff     and many of them have a tool similar to the character map on windows     a cable and or irda transceiver connecting the calculator to a computer make the process easier and expands other possibilities such as on board spreadsheet  database  graphics  and word processing programs  the second option is being able to code the programs on board the calculator itself  this option is facilitated by the inclusion of full screen text editors and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items  some calculators have qwerty keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close to the size of a regular     key computer keyboard  programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers     the most common programming languages used for calculators are similar to keystroke macro languages and variants of basic  the latter can have a large feature set approaching that of basic as found in computers including character and string manipulation  advanced conditional and branching statements  sound  graphics  and more including  of course  the huge spectrum of mathematical  string  bit manipulation  number base  i o  and graphics functions built into the machine     languages for programming calculators fall into all of the main groups  i e  machine code  low level  mid level  high level languages for systems and application programming  scripting  macro  and glue languages  procedural  functional  imperative    object oriented programming can be achieved in some cases     most calculators capable to being connected to a computer can be programmed in assembly language and machine code  although on some calculators this is only possible through using exploits  the most common assembly and machine languages are for tms      sh    zilog z    and various motorola chips  e g  a modified        which serve as the main processors of the machines although many  not all  are modified to some extent from their use elsewhere  some manufacturers do not document and even mildly discourage the assembly language programming of their machines because they must programmed in this way by putting together the program on the pc and then forcing it into the calculator by various improvised methods     other on board programming languages include purpose made languages  variants of eiffel  forth  and lisp  and command script facilities which are similar in function to batch shell programming and other glue languages on computers but generally not as full featured  ports of other languages like bbc basic and development of on board interpreters for fortran  rexx  awk  perl  unix shells  e g   bash  zsh   other shells  dos windows  x  os    and windows nt family shells as well as the related  dos   nt and  os  as well as dcl   cobol  c  python  tcl  pascal  delphi  algol  and other languages are at various levels of development     some calculators  especially those with other pda like functions have actual operating systems including the ti proprietary os for its more recent machines  dos  windows ce  and rarely windows nt     embedded et seq  and linux  experiments with the ti     ti     ti    plus and voyage     machines show the possibility of installing some variants of other systems such as a chopped down variant of cp m   k  an operating system which has been used for portable devices in the past     tools which allow for programming the calculators in c c   and possibly fortran and assembly language are used on the computer side  such as hpgcc  tigcc and others  flash memory is another means of conveyance of information to and from the calculator     the on board basic variants in ti graphing calculators and the languages available on hp    type calculators can be used for rapid prototyping by developers  professors  and students  often when a computer is not close at hand     most graphing calculators have on board spreadsheets which usually integrate with microsoft excel on the computer side  at this time  spreadsheets with macro and other automation facilities on the calculator side are not on the market  in some cases  the list  matrix  and data grid facilities can be combined with the native programming language of the calculator to have the effect of a macro and scripting enabled spreadsheet
