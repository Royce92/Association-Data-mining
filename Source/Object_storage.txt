 object storage  also known as object based storage   is a storage architecture that manages data as objects  as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks   each object typically includes the data itself  a variable amount of metadata  and a globally unique identifier  object storage can be implemented at multiple levels  including the device level  object storage device   the system level  and the interface level  in each case  object storage seeks to enable capabilities not addressed by other storage architectures  like interfaces that can be directly programmable by the application  a namespace that can span multiple instances of physical hardware  and data management functions like data replication and data distribution at object level granularity     object storage systems allow relatively inexpensive  scalable and self healing retention of massive amounts of unstructured data  object storage is used for diverse purposes such as storing photos on facebook  songs on spotify  or files in online collaboration services  such as dropbox              object storage was first proposed at carnegie mellon university s parallel data lab as a research project in        research by garth gibson  et al  on network attached secure disks first promoted the concept of splitting less common operations  like namespace manipulations  from common operations  like reads and writes  to optimize the performance and scale of both   another key concept was abstracting the writes and reads of data to more flexible data containers  objects   fine grained access control through object storage architecture  was further described by one of the nasd team  howard gobioff  who later was one of the inventors of the google file system   other related work includes the coda filesystem project at carnegie mellon  which started in       and spawned the lustre file system   there is also the oceanstore project at uc berkeley   which started in         one of the earliest and best known object storage products  emc s centera  debuted in         however  development of centera s technology started even earlier  at a company called filepool  which was acquired by emc in           overall industry investment in object storage technology has been sustained for over a decade  from      to       there has been at least      million of venture financing related to object storage  including vendors like amplidata  bycast  caringo  cleversafe  nirvanix  and scality    this doesn t include millions of dollars of private engineering from systems vendors like datadirect networks  wos   emc  centera  atmos  vipr   hds  hcp   hp  hp openstack   ibm  netapp  storagegrid   redhat glusterfs and keeper technology  keepersafe   cloud services vendors like amazon  aws s    microsoft  microsoft azure  and google  google cloud storage   or the many man years of open source development at lustre  openstack  swift   mogilefs  ceph and skylable sx     one of the design principles of object storage is to abstract some of the lower layers of storage away from the administrators and applications  thus  data is exposed and managed as objects instead of files or blocks  objects contain additional descriptive properties which can be used for better indexing or management  administrators do not have to perform lower level storage functions like constructing and managing logical volumes to utilize disk capacity or setting raid levels to deal with disk failure     object storage also allows the addressing and identification of individual objects by more than just file name and file path  object storage adds a unique identifier within a bucket  or across the entire system  to support much larger namespaces and eliminate name collisions     object storage explicitly separates file metadata from data to support additional capabilities     additionally  in object based file systems     object based storage devices  osd  manage metadata and data at the storage device level     object storage provides programmatic interfaces to allow applications to manipulate data  at the base level  this includes crud functions for basic read  write and delete operations  some object storage implementations go further  supporting additional functionality like object versioning  object replication  and movement of objects between different tiers and types of storage  most api implementations are rest based  allowing the use of many standard http calls     object storage at the protocol and device layer was proposed    years ago and approved for the scsi command set nearly    years ago as  object based storage device commands   osd     but has not been productized until the development of the seagate kinetic open storage platform      the scsi command set for object storage devices was developed by a working group of the storage networking industry association  snia  for the t   committee of the international committee for information technology standards  incits     t   is responsible for all scsi standards     some high performance distributed file systems use an object based architecture  where file metadata is stored in metadata servers and file data is stored in object storage servers  file system client software interacts with the distinct servers  and abstracts them to present a full file system to users and applications  lustre is an example of this type of object storage     some early incarnations of object storage were used for archiving  as implementations were optimized for data services like immutability  not performance  emc centera and hitachi hcp  formerly known as hcap  are two commonly cited object storage products for archiving  another example is quantum lattus object storage platform     the vast majority of cloud storage available in the market leverages an object storage architecture  two notable examples of cloud storage services are amazon web services s  and rackspace files  aws s  debuted in      and has since been synonymous with cloud storage services  other major cloud storage services include microsoft azure and google cloud storage     some large internet companies developed their own software when object storage products were not commercially available or use cases were very specific  facebook famously invented their own object storage software  code named haystack  to address their particular massive scale photo management needs efficiently       a few object storage systems  such as ceph  glusterfs  and scality ring support unified file and object  ufo  storage  allowing some clients to store objects on a storage system while simultaneously other clients store files on the same storage system  while  hybrid storage  is not a widely accepted term for this concept  interoperable interfaces to the same set of data is becoming available in some object storage products     more general purpose object storage systems came to market around       lured by the incredible growth of  captive  storage systems within web applications like yahoo mail and the early success of cloud storage  object storage systems promised the scale and capabilities of cloud storage  with the ability to deploy the system within an enterprise  or at an aspiring cloud storage service provider  notable examples of object storage systems include caringo swarm  emc atmos  hitachi hcp  openstack swift  and scality ring     one of the first object storage products  lustre  is used in     of the top     supercomputers and      of the top        as of june           this includes   of the top     including the current fastest system on the list   china s tianhe   and the second fastest  the titan supercomputer at oak ridge national laboratory  pictured on the right        object storage systems had good adoption in the early     s as an archive platform  particularly in the wake of compliance laws like sarbanes oxley  after five years in the market  emc s centera product claimed over       customers and     petabytes shipped by         hitachi s hcp product also claims many petabyte scale customers    newer object storage systems have also gotten some traction  particularly around very large custom applications like ebay s auction site  where emc atmos is used to manage over     million objects a day    as of march          emc claims to have sold over     exabytes of atmos storage    on july          los alamos national lab chose the scality ring as the basis for a     petabyte storage environment  which would be among the largest ever        captive  object storage systems like facebook s haystack have scaled impressively  in april       haystack was managing    billion photos and     petabytes of storage  adding     million photos and    terabytes a week    facebook more recently stated that they were adding     million photos a day and were storing     billion photos    this could equal as much as     petabytes       cloud storage has become pervasive as many new web and mobile applications choose it as a common way to store binary data    as the storage backend to many popular applications like smugmug and dropbox  aws s  has grown to massive scale  citing over   trillion objects stored in april         two months later  microsoft claimed that they stored even more objects in azure at     trillion    by april       azure claimed over    trillion objects stored    windows azure storage manages blobs  user files   tables  structured storage   and queues  message delivery  and counts them all as objects       idc has begun to assess the object based storage market annually using its marketscape methodology  idc describes the marketscape as      a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the characteristics that assess a vendor s current and future success in the said market or market segment and provide a measure of their ascendancy to become a leader or maintain a leadership  idc marketscape assessments are particularly helpful in emerging markets that are often fragmented  have several players  and lack clear leaders        in       idc rated cleversafe  scality  datadirect networks  amplidata  and emc as leaders    in       it rated scality  cleversafe  datadirect networks  hitachi data systems  amplidata  emc  and cloudian as leaders       in the first version of the osd standard    objects are specified with a    bit partition id and a    bit object id  partitions are created and deleted within an osd  and objects are created and deleted within partitions  there are no fixed sizes associated with partitions or objects  they are allowed to grow subject to physical size limitations of the device or logical quota constraints on a partition     an extensible set of attributes describe objects  some attributes are implemented directly by the osd  such as the number of bytes in an object and the modify time of an object  there is a special policy tag attribute that is part of the security mechanism  other attributes are uninterpreted by the osd  these are set on objects by the higher level storage systems that use the osd for persistent storage  for example  attributes might be used to classify objects  or to capture relationships among different objects stored on different osds     a list command returns a list of identifiers for objects within a partition  optionally filtered by matches against their attribute values  a list command can also return selected attributes of the listed objects     read and write commands can be combined  or piggy backed  with commands to get and set attributes  this ability reduces the number of times a high level storage system has to cross the interface to the osd  which can improve overall efficiency     a second generation of the scsi command set   object based storage devices       osd    added support for snapshots  collections of objects  and improved error handling       a snapshot is a point in time copy of all the objects in a partition into a new partition  the osd can implement a space efficient copy using copy on write techniques so that the two partitions share objects that are unchanged between the snapshots  or the osd might physically copy the data to the new partition  the standard defines clones  which are writeable  and snapshots  which are read only     a collection is a special kind of object that contains the identifiers of other objects  there are operations to add and delete from collections  and there are operations to get or set attributes for all the objects in a collection  collections are also used for error reporting  if an object becomes damaged by the occurrence of a media defect  i e   a bad spot on the disk  or by a software error within the osd implementation  its identifier is put into a special error collection  the higher level storage system that uses the osd can query this collection and take corrective action as necessary     let s first clarify what a key value store and an object store are  using the traditional block storage interface  one has a series of fixed size blocks which are numbered starting at    data must be that exact fixed size and can be stored in a particular block which is identified by its logical block number  lbn   later  one can retrieve that block of data by specifying its unique lbn     with a key value store  data is identified by a key rather than a lbn  a key might be cat or olive or     it can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes of arbitrary length  data  called a value in this parlance  does not need to be a fixed size and also can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes of arbitrary length  one stores data by presenting the key and data  value  to the data store and can later retrieve the data by presenting the key  you ve seen this concept before in programming languages  python calls them dictionaries  perl calls them hashes  java and c   call them maps  etc  several data stores also implement key value stores such as memcached  redis and couchdb     object stores are similar to key value stores except that the key must be a positive integer like a lbn  however  unlike a lbn  the key can be any positive integer  it does not have to map to an existing logical block number  in practice  it is usually limited to    bits  more like a key value store than the traditional block storage interface  data is not limited to a fixed size block but may be an arbitrary size  object stores also allow one to associate a limited set of attributes with each piece of data  the key  value and set of attributes is referred to as an object  to add more confusion  sometimes key value stores are loosely referred to as object stores but technically there is a difference
