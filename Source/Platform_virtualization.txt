 computer hardware virtualization is the virtualization of computers or operating systems  it hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from users  instead showing another abstract computing platform    at its origins  the software that controlled virtualization was called a  control program   but the terms  hypervisor  or  virtual machine monitor  are now preferred              the term  virtualization  was coined in the     s to refer to a virtual machine  sometimes called  pseudo machine    a term which itself dates from the experimental ibm m     x system citation needed the creation and management of virtual machines has been called  platform virtualization   or  server virtualization   more recently     platform virtualization is performed on a given hardware platform by host software  a control program   which creates a simulated computer environment  a virtual machine  vm   for its guest software  the guest software is not limited to user applications  many hosts allow the execution of complete operating systems  the guest software executes as if it were running directly on the physical hardware  with several notable caveats  access to physical system resources  such as the network access  display  keyboard  and disk storage  is generally managed at a more restrictive level than the host processor and system memory  guests are often restricted from accessing specific peripheral devices  or may be limited to a subset of the device s native capabilities  depending on the hardware access policy implemented by the virtualization host     virtualization often exacts performance penalties  both in resources required to run the hypervisor  and as well as in reduced performance on the virtual machine compared to running native on the physical machine     however  when multiple vms are concurrently running on the same physical host  each vm may exhibit a varying and unstable performance  which highly depends on the workload imposed on the system by other vms  unless proper techniques are used for temporal isolation among virtual machines     there are several approaches to platform virtualization     examples of virtualization scenarios     in full virtualization  the virtual machine simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified  guest  os  one designed for the same instruction set  to be run in isolation  this approach was pioneered in      with the ibm cp    and cp     predecessors of the vm family  examples outside the mainframe field include parallels workstation  parallels desktop for mac  virtualbox  virtual iron  oracle vm  virtual pc  virtual server  hyper v  vmware workstation  vmware server  discontinued  formerly gsx server   vmware esxi  qemu  adeos  mac on linux  win bsd  win lin pro  and egenera vblade technology     in hardware assisted virtualization  the hardware provides architectural support that facilitates building a virtual machine monitor and allows guest oses to be run in isolation   hardware assisted virtualization was first introduced on the ibm system     in       for use with vm      the first virtual machine operating system  in      and       intel and amd provided additional hardware to support virtualization  sun microsystems  now oracle corporation  added similar features in their ultrasparc t series processors in       examples of virtualization platforms adapted to such hardware include linux kvm  vmware workstation  vmware fusion  microsoft hyper v  microsoft virtual pc  xen  parallels desktop for mac  oracle vm server for sparc  virtualbox and parallels workstation     in      first generation     and    bit x   hardware support was found rarely to offer performance advantages over software virtualization      in partial virtualization  including address space virtualization  the virtual machine simulates multiple instances of much of an underlying hardware environment  particularly address spaces clarification needed usually  this means that entire operating systems cannot run in the virtual machine u   bwhich would be the sign of full virtualization u   bbut that many applications can run  a key form of partial virtualization is address space virtualization  in which each virtual machine consists of an independent address space  this capability requires address relocation hardware  and has been present in most practical examples of partial virtualization citation needed    partial virtualization was an important historical milestone on the way to full virtualization  it was used in the first generation time sharing system ctss  in the ibm m     x experimental paging system  and arguably systems like mvs and the commodore     a couple of  task switch  programs  dubious   discusscitation needed the term could also be used to describe any operating system that provides separate address spaces for individual users or processes  including many that today would not be considered virtual machine systems  experience with partial virtualization  and its limitations  led to the creation of the first full virtualization system  ibm s cp     the first iteration of cp cms which would eventually become ibm s vm family    many more recent systems  such as microsoft windows and linux  as well as the remaining categories below  also use this basic approach dubious   discusscitation needed     partial virtualization is significantly easier to implement than full virtualization  it has often provided useful  robust virtual machines  capable of supporting important applications  partial virtualization has proven highly successful for sharing computer resources among multiple users citation needed    however  in comparison with full virtualization  its drawback is in situations requiring backward compatibility or portability  it can be hard to anticipate precisely which features have been used by a given application  if certain hardware features are not simulated  then any software using those features will fail     in paravirtualization  the virtual machine does not necessarily simulate hardware  but instead  or in addition  offers a special api that can only be used by modifyingclarification needed the  guest  os  for this to be possible  the  guest  os s source code must be available  if the source code is available  it is sufficient to replace sensitive instructions with calls to vmm apis  e g    cli  with  vm_handle_cli      then re compile the os and use the new binaries  this system call to the hypervisor is called a  hypercall  in trango and xen  it is implemented via a diag   diagnose   hardware instruction in ibm s cms under vmclarification needed  which was the origin of the term hypervisor   examples include ibm s lpars   win lin  x  sun s logical domains  z vm citation needed and trango     in operating system level virtualization  a physical server is virtualized at the operating system level  enabling multiple isolated and secure virtualized servers to run on a single physical server  the  guest  operating system environments share the same running instance of the operating system as the host system  thus  the same operating system kernel is also used to implement the  guest  environments  and applications running in a given  guest  environment view it as a stand alone system  the pioneer implementation was freebsd jails  other examples include solaris containers  openvz  linux vserver  lxc  aix workload partitions  parallels virtuozzo containers  and icore virtual accounts     a disaster recovery  dr  plan is good business practice for a hardware virtualization platform solution  dr of a virtualization environment can ensure high rate of availability during a wide range of situations that disrupt normal business operations  continued operations of vms is mission critical and a dr can compensate for concerns of hardware performance and maintenance requirements  a hardware virtualization dr environment involves hardware and software protection solutions based on business continuity needs  which include the methods described below
