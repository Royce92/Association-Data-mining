 deregulation is the process of removing or reducing state regulations   it is therefore opposite of regulation  which refers to the process of the government regulating certain activities             the stated rationale for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations will lead to a raised level of competitiveness  therefore higher productivity  more efficiency and lower prices overall  opposition to deregulation may usually involve apprehension regarding environmental pollution  and environmental quality standards  such as the removal of regulations on hazardous materials   financial uncertainty  and constraining monopolies     regulatory reform is a parallel development alongside deregulation  regulatory reform refers to organized and ongoing programs to review regulations with a view to minimizing  simplifying  and making them more cost effective  such efforts  given impetus by the regulatory flexibility act of       are embodied in the united states office of management and budget s office of information and regulatory affairs  and the united kingdom s better regulation commission  cost benefit analysis is frequently used in such reviews  in addition  there have been regulatory innovations  usually suggested by economists  such as emissions trading     deregulation can be distinguished from privatization  where privatization can be seen as taking state owned service providers into the private sector     argentina underwent heavy economic deregulation  privatization  and had a fixed exchange rate during the menem administration              in dec         paul krugman compared enron with argentina  claiming that both were experiencing economic collapse due to excessive deregulation   two months later  herbert inhaber claimed that krugman confused correlation with causation  and neither collapse was due to excessive deregulation      having announced a wide range of deregulatory policies  labor prime minister bob hawke announced the policy of  minimum effective regulation  in       this introduced now familiar requirements for  regulatory impact statements   but compliance by governmental agencies took many years  australia experienced deregulation of their labor market during the late     s under hawke keating labor governments  the country saw minor deregulation of the labor market beginning in      under john howard s liberal party of australia through their workchoices policy  however  it was reversed under the following rudd labor government     natural gas is deregulated in most of the country  with the exception of some atlantic provinces and some pockets like vancouver island and medicine hat  most of this deregulation happened in the mid     s   there is price comparison service operating in some of these jurisdictions  particularly ontario  alberta and bc  the other provinces are small markets and have not attracted suppliers  customers have the choice of purchasing from a local distribution company  ldc  or a deregulated supplier  in most provinces the ldc is not allowed to offer a term contract  just a variable price based on the spot market  ldc prices are changed either monthly or quarterly     the province of ontario began deregulation of electricity supply in       but pulled back temporarily due to voter and consumer backlash at the resulting price volatility   the government is still searching for a stable working regulatory framework     the current status is a partially regulated structure in which consumers have received a capped price for a portion of the publicly owned generation  the remainder of the price has been market price based and there are numerous competitive energy contract providers  however  ontario is installing smart meters in all homes and small businesses and is changing the pricing structure to time of use pricing  all small volume consumers are to be shifted to the new rate structure by the end of       there is price comparison service operating in these jurisdictions     the province of alberta has deregulated their electricity provision  customers are free to choose which company they sign up with  but there are few companies to choose from and the price of electricity has increased substantially for consumers because the market is too small to support competition  if they choose they may remain with the utility at the regulated rate option     former premier ralph klein based the entire deregulation scheme on the enron model  and continued with it even after the highly publicized and disastrous california electricity crisis  and the collapse of enron because of illegal accounting practices      the taxi industry was deregulated in ireland leading to an influx of new taxis  this was due to the price of a licence dropping overnight  the number of taxis increased dramatically      the conservative government of margaret thatcher started a program of deregulation and privatization after the general election of       these included express coach  transport act        british telecom  completed in        privatisation of london bus services         local bus services  transport act       and the railways         the feature of all those privatisations was that their shares were offered to the general public     since      the labour governments of tony blair and gordon brown developed a programme of better regulation  this included a general programme for government departments to review  simplify or abolish their existing regulations  and a  one in  one out  approach to new regulations  in       the chancellor of the exchequer announced the deregulation of the banks and other financial institutions  they freed the bank of england from direct government control and removed the power by the bank of england  and therefore by the government  from controlling the financial activities of banks in the uk  in       new primary legislation  the legislative and regulatory reform act       was introduced to establish statutory principles and a code of practice and it permits ministers to make regulatory reform orders  rros  to deal with older laws which they deem to be out of date  obscure or irrelevant  this act has often been criticised and called  the abolition of parliament act      the labour governments did not privatise many publicly owned services because most had been privatised by the previous government  however  some government owned businesses such as qinetiq were privatised  but a great deal of infrastructure and maintenance work previously carried out by government departments was contracted out  out sourced  to private enterprise under the public private partnership  with competitive bidding for contracts within a regulatory framework  this included large projects such as building new hospitals for the national health service  building new state schools  and maintaining the london underground  these privatisations were never offered to the general public to buy shares  they were all offered to commercial companies only     new zealand governments adopted policies of extensive deregulation from      to       originally initiated by the fourth labour government of new zealand   the policies of deregulation were later continued by the fourth national government of new zealand  the policies had the goal of liberalising the economy and were notable for their very comprehensive coverage and innovations  specific policies included  floating the exchange rate  establishing an independent reserve bank  performance contracts for senior civil servants  public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting  tax neutrality  subsidy free agriculture  and industry neutral competition regulation  economic growth was resumed in       new zealand was changed from a somewhat closed and centrally controlled economy to one of the most open economies in the oecd   as a result  new zealand  went from having a reputation as an almost socialist country  to being considered one of the most business friendly countries of the world  next to singapore  however  critics charge that the deregulation has brought little benefit to some sections of society  and has caused much of new zealand s economy  including almost all of the banks  to become foreign owned citation needed    russia went through wide ranging deregulation  and concomitant privatization  efforts in the late     s under boris yeltsin  now partially reversed under vladimir putin  the main thrust of deregulation has been the electricity sector  see rao ues   with railroads and communal utilities tied in second place citation needed deregulation of the natural gas sector  gazprom  is one of the more frequent demands placed upon russia by the united states and european union     one problem that encouraged deregulation was the way in which the regulated industries often controlled the government regulatory agencies  using them to serve the industries  interests  even where regulatory bodies started out functioning independently  a process known as regulatory capture often saw industry interests come to dominate those of the consumer  a similar pattern has been observed with the deregulation process itself  often effectively controlled by the regulated industries through lobbying the legislative process  such political forces  however  exist in many other forms for other special interest groups     during the progressive era      s        presidents theodore roosevelt  william howard taft  and woodrow wilson instituted regulation on parts of the american economy  most notably in regulating big business and industry  some of their most prominent reforms are trust busting  the destruction and banning of monopolies   the creation of laws protecting the american consumer  the creation of a federal income tax  by the sixteenth amendment  the income tax used a progressive tax structure with especially high taxes on the wealthy   the establishment of the federal reserve  and the institution of shorter working hours  higher wages  better living conditions  better rights and privileges to trade unions  protection of rights of strikers  banning of unfair labor practices  and the delivery of more social services to the working classes and social safety nets to many unemployed workers  thus helping to facilitate the creation of a welfare state in the united states and eventually in most developed countries     during the presidencies of warren harding           and calvin coolidge            the federal government generally pursued laissez faire economic policies  after the onset of the great depression  president franklin d  roosevelt implemented many economic regulations  including the national industrial recovery act  which was struck down by the supreme court   regulation of trucking  airlines and the communications industry  the institution of the securities exchange act of       and the glass steagall act  which was passed in       these     s regulations stayed largely in place until richard nixon s administration   in supporting his competition limiting regulatory initiatives president roosevelt blamed the excesses of big business for causing an economic bubble  however  historians lack consensus in describing the causal relationship between various events and the role of government economic policy in causing or ameliorating the depression     deregulation gained momentum in the     s  influenced by research at the university of chicago and the theories of ludwig von mises  friedrich von hayek  and milton friedman  among others citation needed two leading  think tanks  in washington  the brookings institution and the american enterprise institute  were active in holding seminars and publishing studies advocating deregulatory initiatives throughout the     s and     s citation needed alfred e  kahn played an unusual role in both publishing as an academic and participating in the carter administration s efforts to deregulate transportation     the first comprehensive proposal to deregulate a major industry in the united states  transportation  originated in the richard nixon administration and was forwarded to congress in late         this proposal was initiated and developed by an interagency group that included the council of economic advisors  represented by hendrik houthakker and thomas gale moore     white house office of consumer affairs  represented by jack pearce   department of justice  department of transportation  department of labor  and other agencies       the proposal addressed both rail and truck transportation  but not air carriage     d congress  senate bill       the developers of this legislation in this administration sought to cultivate support from commercial buyers of transportation services  consumer organizations  economists  and environmental organization leaders    this  civil society  coalition became a template for coalitions influential in efforts to deregulate trucking and air transport later in the decade     after nixon left office  the gerald ford presidency  with the allied interests  secured passage of the first significant change in regulatory policy in a pro competitive direction  in the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of       president jimmy carter devoted substantial effort to transportation deregulation  and worked with congressional and civil society leaders to pass the airline deregulation act  october            staggers rail act  signed october            and the motor carrier act of       signed july              these were the major deregulation acts in transportation that set the general conceptual and legislative framework  which replaced the regulatory systems put in place between the     s and the     s  the dominant common theme of these acts was to lessen barriers to entry in transport markets and promote more independent  competitive pricing among transport service providers  substituting the freed up competitive market forces for detailed regulatory control of entry  exit  and price making in transport markets  thus deregulation arose  though regulations to promote competition were put in place     u s  president ronald reagan campaigned on the promise of rolling back environmental regulations  his devotion to the economic beliefs of milton friedman led him to promote the deregulation of finance  agriculture  and transportation    a series of substantial enactments were needed to work out the process of encouraging competition in transportation  interstate buses were addressed in       in the bus regulatory reform act of       freight forwarders  freight aggregators  got more freedoms in the surface freight forwarder deregulation act of       as many states continued to regulate the operations of motor carriers within their own state  the intrastate aspect of the trucking and bus industries was addressed in the federal aviation administration authorization act of       which provided that  a state  political subdivision of a state  or political authority of two or more states may not enact or enforce a law  regulation  or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price  route  or service of any motor carrier      u s c xa  xa       c      supp  v           ocean transportation was the last to be addressed  this was done in two acts  the ocean shipping act of      and the ocean shipping reform act of       these acts were less thoroughgoing than the legislation dealing with u s  domestic transportation  in that they left in place the  conference  system in international ocean liner shipping  which historically embodied cartel mechanisms  however  these acts permitted independent rate making by conference participants  and the      act permitted secret contract rates  which tend to undercut collective carrier pricing  according to the united states federal maritime commission  in an assessment in       this appears to have opened up substantial competitive activity in ocean shipping  with beneficial economic results     the airline deregulation act is an example of a deregulatory act whose success has been questioned  since deregulation  real prices for air travel has fallen by more than half  and travellers have more options  but there have been questions about disruptions  employee pensions and the lack of small city service       the emergency petroleum allocation act was a regulating law  consisting of a mix of regulations and deregulation  which passed in response to opec price hikes and domestic price controls which affected the      oil crisis in the united states  after adoption of this federal legislation  numerous state legislation known as natural gas choice programs have sprung up in several states  as well as the district of columbia  natural gas choice programs allow residential and small volume natural gas users to compare purchases from natural gas suppliers with traditional utility companies  there are currently hundreds of federally unregulated natural gas suppliers operating in the us  regulation characteristics of natural gas choice programs  vary between the laws of the currently adoptive    states  as of           deregulation of the electricity sector in the u s  began in       the energy policy act of      eliminated obstacles for wholesale electricity competition  but deregulation has yet to be introduced in all states  as of april          u s  states  connecticut  delaware  illinois  maine  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  montana  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  and texas  and the district of columbia have introduced deregulated electricity markets to consumers in some capacity  additionally  seven states  arizona  arkansas  california  nevada  new mexico  virginia  and wyoming  began the process of electricity deregulation in some capacity but have since suspended deregulation efforts       deregulation was put into effect in the communications industry by the government at the start of the multi channel transition era    this deregulation put into place a division of labor between the studios and the networks    communications in the united states  and internationally  are areas in which both technology and regulatory policy have been in flux  rapid development of computer and communications technology   particularly the internet   have increased the size and variety of communications offerings  wireless  traditional landline telephone  and cable companies increasingly invade each other s traditional markets and compete across a broad spectrum of activities  the federal communications commission and congress appear to be attempting to facilitate this evolution  in mainstream economic thinking  development of this competition would militate against detailed regulatory control of prices and service offerings  and hence favor deregulation of prices and entry into markets    on the other hand  there exists substantial concern about concentration of media ownership resulting from relaxation of historic controls on media ownership designed to safeguard diversity of viewpoint and open discussion in the society  and about what some perceive as high prices in cable company offerings at this point     the financial sector in the u s  has evolved a great deal in recent decades  during which there have been some regulatory changes and the creation of new financial products such as the securitization of loan obligations of various sorts and credit default swaps  among the most important of the regulatory changes was the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act in       which repealed the parts of the glass steagall act regarding interest rate regulation via retail banking     the deregulation movement of the late   th century had substantial economic effects and engendered substantial controversy  as preceding sections of this article indicate  the movement was based on intellectual perspectives which prescribed substantial scope for market forces  and opposing perspectives have been in play in national and international discourse     the movement toward greater reliance on market forces has been closely related to the growth of economic and institutional globalization between about      and      citation needed    critics of economic liberalisation and deregulation cite the benefits of regulation  and believe that certain regulations do not distort markets and allows companies to continue to be competitive  or according to some  grow in competition    much as the state plays an important role through issues such as property rights  appropriate regulation is argued by some to be  crucial to realise the benefits of service liberalisation        critics of deregulation often cite the need of regulation to       adam thierer wrote   the first step toward creating a free market in electricity is to repeal the federal statutes and regulations that hinder electricity competition and consumer choice        sharon beder  a writer with pr watch  wrote  electricity deregulation was supposed to bring cheaper electricity prices and more choice of suppliers to householders  instead it has brought wildly volatile wholesale prices and undermined the reliability of the electricity supply        william k  black claims that inappropriate deregulation helped create a criminogenic environment in the savings and loan industry  which attracted opportunistic control frauds like charles keating  whose massive political campaign contributions were used successfully to further suppress regulatory oversight  the combination substantially delayed effective governmental action  thereby substantially increasing the losses when the fraudulent ponzi schemes finally collapsed and were exposed  after the collapse  regulators in the office of the comptroller of the currency  occ  and the office of thrift supervision  ots  were finally allowed to file thousands of criminal complaints that led to over a thousand felony convictions of key savings and loan insiders    by contrast  between      and       the occ and ots combined made  zero  criminal referrals  black concluded that elite financial fraud has effectively been decriminalized       economist jayati ghosh is of the opinion that deregulation is responsible for increasing price volatility on the commodity market  this particularly affects people and economies in developing countries  more and more homogenization of financial institution which may also be a result of deregulation turns out to be a major concern for small scale producers in those countries
