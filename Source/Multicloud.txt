 multicloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture     for example  an enterprise may concurrently use separate cloud providers for infrastructure  iaas  and software  saas  services  or use multiple infrastructure  iaas  providers  in the latter case  they may use different infrastructure providers for different workloads  deploy a single workload load balanced across multiple providers  active active   or deploy a single workload on one provider  with a backup on another  active passive      there are a number of reasons for deploying a multicloud architecture  including reducing reliance on any single vendor  increasing flexibility through choice  mitigating against disasters  etc  it is similar to the use of best of breed applications from multiple developers on a personal computer  rather than the defaults offered by the operating system vendor  it is a recognition of the fact that no one provider can be everything for everyone  it differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services rather than multiple deployment modes  public  private  legacy        various issues also present themselves in a multicloud environment  security and governance is more complicated  and more  moving parts  may create resiliency issues  selection of the right cloud products and services can also present a challenge  and users may suffer from the paradox of choice
