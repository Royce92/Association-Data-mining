 a portable media player  pmp   mobile digital media player  m dmp  or digital audio player  dap   is a portable digital consumer electronics device capable of storing and playing digital media such as audio  images  and video files    the data is typically stored on a cd dvd  flash memory  microdrive  or hard drive  in contrast  analog portable audio players play music from non digital media such as cassette tapes  or records     often mobile digital audio players are marketed and sold as  portable mp  players   even if they also support other file formats and media types    other types of electronic devices which can also act as a like mobile digital media player  but only have those media playback features as a secondary function  are mobile phones  smartphones  tablets  and sometimes even digital cameras are referred as portable media players because of their playback capabilities      even though most of the flash based and hard drive based media players are no longer in production  some like apple ipod and sony walkman are still being produced  however portable cd dvd players are still manufactured by brands across the world     this article focuses on portable devices that have the main function of playing media             the immediate predecessor in the market place of the digital audio player was the portable cd player and prior to that  the personal stereo     british scientist kane kramer designed one of the earliest digital audio players  which he called the ixi  his      prototype was capable of approximately one hour of audio playback but it did not enter commercial production  his uk patent application was not filed until        apple inc  hired kramer as a consultant and presented his work as an example of prior art in the field of digital audio players during their litigation with burst com almost two decades later      in      at t developed the flashpac digital audio player which initially utilized at t perceptual audio coding  pac   for music compression  but in      switched to aac   at about the same time at t also developed an internal web based music streaming service that had the ability to download music to flashpac    aac and such music downloading services later formed the foundation for the apple ipod and itunes       the first portable mp  player was launched in      by saehan information systems    which sold its  mpman  player in asia in spring         in mid       the south korean company licensed the players for north american distribution to eiger labs  which rebranded them as the eigerman f   and f      the flash based players were available in   xa mb or   xa mb    or    songs  storage capacity and had a lcd screen to tell the user the song currently playing     the first production volume portable digital audio player was the audible player  also known as mobileplayer  or digital words to go  from audible com available for sale in january       for usd       it only supported playback of digital audio in audible s proprietary  low bitrate format which was developed for spoken word recordings  capacity was limited to   mb of internal flash memory  or about   hours of play  using a custom rechargeable battery pack  the unit had no display and rudimentary controls         the rio pmp    from diamond multimedia was introduced in september       a few months after the mpman  and also featured a    mb storage capacity  it was a success during the holiday season  with sales exceeding expectations    interest and investment in digital music were subsequently spurred from it    because of the player s notoriety as the target of a major lawsuit    the rio is erroneously assumed to be the first digital audio player       in       compaq developed the personal jukebox  which was the first hard drive based dap using a      laptop drive  it was licensed to hango electronics  now known as remote solution   which first sold the pjb      personal jukebox  in       the player had an initial capacity of    xa gb  with an advertised capacity of      songs       in       creative released the  gb hard drive based creative nomad jukebox  the name borrowed the jukebox metaphor popularised by remote solution  also used by archos  later players in the creative nomad range used microdrives rather than laptop drives     in october       south korean software company cowon systems released their first mp  player  the cw     under the brand name iaudio     in december       some months after the creative s nomad jukebox  archos released its jukebox      with a  gb hard drive     on october           apple computer unveiled the first generation ipod  a  xa gb hard drive based dap with a      toshiba hard drive and a massive    monochrome display  with the development of a spartan user interface and a smaller form factor  the ipod was initially popular within the macintosh community  in july       apple introduced the second generation update to the ipod  it was compatible with windows computers through musicmatch jukebox  in       apple introduced the ipod touch  the first ipod with a multi touch screen  its media player was split into the music and videos apps     in       archos released the first  portable media player   pmp   the archos jukebox multimedia   with a little      color screen  manufacturers have since implemented abilities to view images and play videos into their devices  the next year  archos released an other multimedia jukebox  the av     with a      screen and a   gb hard drive     in       microsoft attempted to take advantage of the growing pmp market by launching the portable media center  pmc  platform  it was introduced at the      consumer electronics show with the announcement of the zen portable media center    which was co developed by creative  the microsoft zune series would later be based on the gigabeat s  one of the pmc implemented players     in may       flash memory maker sandisk entered the pmp market with the sansa line of players  starting with the e    series  and then following up with the m    series  and c    series     samsung sph m      the first mobile phone with built in mp  player was produced in south korea in august           samsung sph m     uproar  launched in      was the first cell phone to have mp  music capabilities   in the u s  market  the innovation spread rapidly across the globe and by       more than half of all music sold in south korea was sold directly to mobile phones and all major handset makers in the world had released mp  playing phones  by       more mp  playing mobile phones were sold than all stand alone mp  players put together  the rapid rise of the media player in phones was quoted by apple as a primary reason for developing the iphone  in       the installed base of phones that could play media was over   billion citation needed    digital audio players are generally categorized by storage media     pmps are capable of playing digital audio  images  and video  usually  a color liquid crystal display  lcd  or organic light emitting diode  oled  screen is used as a display  various players include the ability to record video  usually with the aid of optional accessories or cables  and audio  with a built in microphone or from a line out cable or fm tuner  some players include readers for memory cards  which are advertised to equip players with extra storage or transferring media  in some players  features of a personal organizer are emulated  or support for games  like the iriver clix  through compatibility of adobe flash lite  or the playstation portable  is included  only mid range to high end players support savestating for power off  i e  leaves off song video progress similar to tape based media      nearly all players   are compatible with the mp  audio format  and many others support windows media audio  wma   advanced audio coding  aac  and wav  some players are compatible with open source formats like ogg vorbis and the free lossless audio codec  flac   audio files purchased from online stores may include digital rights management  drm  copy protection  which many modern players support     the jpeg format is widely supported by players  some players  like the ipod series  provide compatibility to display additional file formats like gif  png  and tiff  while others are bundled with conversion software     most newer players support the mpeg   part   video format  and many other players are compatible with windows media video  wmv  and avi  software included with the players may be able to convert video files into a compatible format     many players have a built in electret microphone which allows recording  usually recording quality is poor  suitable for speech but not music  there are also professional quality recorders suitable for high quality music recording with external microphones  at prices starting at a few hundred dollars     some daps have fm radio tuners built in  many also have an option to change the band from the usual             xa mhz to the japanese band of            xa mhz  daps typically never have an am band  or even hd radio since such features would be either cost prohibitive for the application  or because of am s sensitivity to interference     newer portable media players are now coming with internet access via wi fi  examples of such devices are android os devices by various manufacturers  and ios devices on apple products like the iphone  ipod touch  and ipad  internet access has even enabled people to use the internet as an underlying communications layer for their choice of music for automated music randomization services like pandora  to on demand video access  which also has music available  such as youtube  this technology has enabled casual and hobbyist djs to cue their tracks from a smaller package from an internet connection  sometimes they will use two identical devices on a crossfade mixer  many such devices also tend to be smartphones     lots of mobile digital media players have last position memory  in which when it is powered off  a user doesn t have to worry about starting at the first track again  or even hearing repeats of others songs when a playlist  album  or whole library is cued for shuffle play  in which shuffle play is a common feature too  early playback devices to even remotely have  last position memory  that predated solid state digital media playback devices were tape based media  except this kind suffered from having to be  rewound   whereas disc based media suffered from no native  last position memory   unless disc players had their own last position memory  however  some models of solid state flash memory  or hard drive ones with some moving parts  are somewhat the  best of both worlds  in the market     most audio formats use lossy compression  to produce as small as possible a file compatible with the desired sound quality  there is a trade off between size and sound quality of lossily compressed files  most formats allow different combinations e g   mp  files may use between     worst        reasonable  and      best  kilobits per second  different lossy formats may give files of different sizes for the same perceived quality       the formats supported by a particular dap depend upon its firmware  sometimes a firmware update adds more formats  to listen to a file on a player  it must be in a supported format  format conversion on a computer is usually possible  but with loss of quality     mp  is the dominant format  and is almost universally supported    it is a proprietary format  manufacturers must pay a small royalty to be allowed to support it       the main proprietary alternative formats are aac and wma  unlike mp   these formats support drm restrictions that are often enforced by files from paid download services     free formats  which do not require manufacturers or music distributors to pay a fee  are available  though less widely supported  examples include vorbis  flac  and speex     most players can also play uncompressed pcm in a container such as wav or aiff     pmps are usually packaged with an installation cd dvd that inserts device drivers  and for some players  software that is capable of seamlessly transferring files between the player and the computer   for recent players  however  these are usually available online via the manufacturers  websites  or natively recognized by the operating system through universal mass storage  ums  or media transfer protocol  mtp      as with daps  pmps come in either flash or hard disk storage  storage capacities have reached up to   xa gb for flash memory based pmps  first reached by the  rd generation ipod touch  and up to  xa tb for hard disk drive pmps  first achieved by the archos   internet tablet     a number of players support memory card slots  including compactflash  cf   secure digital  sd   and memory sticks  they are used to directly transfer content from external devices  and expanding the storage capacity of pmps     a standard pmp uses a   way d pad to navigate  however there have been many alternatives used  most notable are the wheel and touch mechanisms seen on players from the ipod and sansa series  another popular mechanism is the swipe pad  or  squircle   first seen on the zune  additional buttons are commonly seen for features such as volume control     sizes range all the way up to  xa inches  as well  resolutions also vary  going up to wvga  most screens come with a color depth of    bit  but higher quality video oriented devices may range all the way to    bit  otherwise known as true color  with the ability to display      million distinct colors  screens commonly have a matte finish but may also come in glossy to increase color intensity and contrast  more and more devices are now also coming with touch screen as a form of primary or alternate input  this can be for convenience and or aesthetic purposes  certain devices  on the other hand  have no screen whatsoever  reducing costs at the expense of ease of browsing through the media library     some portable media players include a radio receiver  most frequently receiving fm  features for receiving signals from fm stations on mp  players are common on more premium models     some portable media players have recently added features such as simple camera  built in game emulation  playing famicom or other game formats from rom images  and simple text readers and editors  newer pmps have been able to tell time  and even automatically adjust time according to radio reception  and some devices like the  th gen ipod nano even have wristwatch bands available     digital sampling is used to convert an audio wave to a sequence of binary numbers that can be stored in a digital format  such as mp   common features of all mp  players are a memory storage device  such as flash memory or a miniature hard disk drive  an embedded processor  and an audio codec microchip to convert the compressed file into an analogue sound signal  during playback  audio files are read from storage into a ram based memory buffer  and then streamed through an audio codec to produce decoded pcm audio  typically audio formats decode at double to more than    times real speed on portable electronic processors    requiring that the codec output be stored for a time until the dac can play it  in order to save power  portable devices may spend much or nearly all of their time in a low power idle state while waiting for the dac to deplete the output pcm buffer before briefly powering up to decode additional audio     most daps are powered by rechargeable batteries  some of which are not user replaceable  they have a    xa mm stereo jack  music can be listened to with earbuds or headphones  or played via an external amplifier and speakers  some devices also contain internal speakers  through which music can be listened to  although these built in speakers are typically of very low quality     nearly all daps consists of some kind of display screen  although there are exceptions  such as the ipod shuffle  and a set of controls with which the user can browse through the library of music contained in the device  select a track  and play it back  the display  if the unit even has one  can be anything from a simple one or two line monochrome lcd display  similar to what are found on typical pocket calculators  to large  high resolution  full color displays capable of displaying photographs or viewing video content on  the controls can range anywhere from the simple buttons as are found on most typical cd players  such as for skipping through tracks or stopping starting playback to full touch screen controls  such as that found on the ipod touch or the zune hd  one of the more common methods of control is some type of the scroll wheel with associated buttons  this method of control was first introduced with the apple ipod and many other manufacturers have created variants of this control scheme for their respective devices     content is placed on daps typically through a process called  syncing   by connecting the device to a personal computer  typically via usb  and running any special software that is often provided with the dap on a cd rom included with the device  or downloaded from the manufacturer s website  some devices simply appear as an additional disk drive on the host computer  to which music files are simply copied like any other type of file  other devices  most notably the apple ipod or microsoft zune  requires the use of special management software  such as itunes or zune software  respectively  the music  or other content such as tv episodes or movies  is added to the software to create a  library   the library is then  synced  to the dap via the software  the software typically provides options for managing situations when the library is too large to fit on the device being synced to  such options include allowing manual syncing  in that the user can manually  drag n drop  the desired tracks to the device  or allow for the creation of playlists  in addition to the usb connection  some of the more advanced units are now starting to allow syncing through a wireless connection  such as via wi fi or bluetooth       content can also be obtained and placed on some daps  such as the ipod touch or zune hd by allowing access to a  store  or  marketplace   most notably the itunes store or zune marketplace  from which content  such as music and video  and even games  can be purchased and downloaded directly to the device     denoise mode as an alternative to active noise reduction provides for noise free listening to audio in a noise environment  in this mode a special method of digital signal processing  dsp  improves audio intelligibility due to selective gain of the sounds drowning in ambient noise     principle of the method focuses on splitting of external signal into frequency components by filterbank  according to the peculiarities of human perception of specific frequencies  and their processing by adaptive audio compressors  operation threshold in adaptive audio compressors  in contrast to  ordinary  compressors  is regulated depending on ambient noise level for each specific bandwidth  reshaping of the processed signal from adaptive compressor outputs is realized in synthesis filterbank     implementation of this method allows to improve the intelligibility of speech signal and music  the best effect is obtained while listening to audio in the environment with constant noise  in train  automobile  plane   or in the environment with fluctuating noise level  e g  in metro     improvement of signal intelligibility in condition of ambient noise  noise mask  allows user to hear audio well and preserve his hearing ability   in contrast to regular volume amplification     natural mode is characterized by subjective effect of balance of different frequency sounds   regardless of level of distortion  appearing in the reproduction device  it is also regardless of personal user s ability to perceive specific sound frequencies  excluding obvious hearing loss       natural  effect is obtained due to special sound processing algorithm  i e   formula of subjective equalization of frequency response function    its principle is to assess frequency response function  frf  of mediaplayer or any other sound reproduction device  in accordance with audibility threshold in silence  subjective for each person     and to apply gain modifying factor  the factor is determined with the help of integrated function to test audibility threshold  the program generates tone signals  with divergent oscillations   from minimum volume      xa hz to maximum volume appr    xa khz     and user assess their subjective audibility  the principle is similar to in situ audiometry  used in medicine to prescribe a hearing aid     however  the results of test may be used to a limited extent as far as frf of sound devices depends on reproduction volume  it means correction coefficient should be determined several times   for various signal strengths  which is not a particular problem from a practical standpoint     sound around mode allows for real time overlapping of music by microphone audio signal  as a result user may hear playing music and external sounds of the environment at the same time  preserving his safety  especially in big cities and vibrant streets      although these issues are not usually controversial within digital audio players  they are matters of continuing controversy and litigation  including but not limited to content distribution and protection  and digital rights management  drm      the recording industry association of america  riaa  filed a lawsuit in late      against diamond multimedia for its rio players      alleging that the device encouraged copying music illegally  but diamond won a legal victory on the shoulders of the sony corp  v  universal city studios case and daps were legally ruled as electronic devices       according to the scientific committee on emerging and newly identified health risks  the risk of hearing damage from digital audio players depends on both sound level and listening time  the listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss  but some people are putting their hearing at risk  because they set the volume control very high or listen to music at high levels for many hours per day  such listening habits may result in temporary or permanent hearing loss  tinnitus  and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments  however  the reason for these listening habits  as proposed by michael bull in his article in the journal of leisure studies  no dead air  the ipod and the culture of mobile listening  is that people often listen to their ipods or mp  players on high volumes  especially on commutes  to provide a zone of separation  freedom and escape from the rest of the world         much of the risk of hearing loss is largely associated to the fact that many use headphones with the devices  and that they consider them personal devices instead of stereo system components  if a digital audio player is connected via its trs connector to a separate amplification device like a bookshelf stereo or car head unit  then the output can be via speakers rather than a headphone  alternatively many pmp devices now support bluetooth technology  that allows wireless connection to  bluetooth enabled  speakers     new technologies of audio processing allow to reduce significantly risk of hearing damage from listening to media player with headphones  for instance noise mask technology improves intelligibility of media player sound in noisy environment  this allows to listen to audio without the necessity to increase reproduction volume  one of the major reasons of hearing impairment        technology of audio signal processing by formula of subjective equalization of frf allows to compensate for acoustic distortion caused by headphones and mediaplayer used  users  who do not need medical correction of hearing  subjectively perceive audio in this mode as of better quality  that also relieves them from the necessity to increase volume of reproduction      mediaplayers with the technology of sound mixing allow listening to audio tracks and at the same time hearing ambient sounds  adoption of the technology improves safety in big cities taking into account the tempo of life  e g  it allows to hear the sound of a vehicle moving towards you        some mp  players have electromagnet transmitters  as well as receivers  lots of mp  players have built in fm radios  but fm transmitters aren t usually built in due to liability of transmitter feedback from simultaneous transmission and reception of fm  also  certain features like wifi and bluetooth can interfere with professional grade communications systems such as airplanes at airports citation needed
