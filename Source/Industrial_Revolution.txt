 the industrial revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about      to sometime between      and       this transition included going from hand production methods to machines  new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes  improved efficiency of water power  the increasing use of steam power  and the development of machine tools  it also included the change from wood and other bio fuels to coal  textiles were the dominant industry of the industrial revolution in terms of employment  value of output and capital invested  the textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods      the industrial revolution marks a major turning point in history  almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way  in particular  average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth  some economists say that the major impact of the industrial revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history  although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late   th and   th centuries        the industrial revolution began in great britain  and spread to western europe and north america within a few decades   the precise start and end of the industrial revolution is still debated among historians  as is the pace of economic and social changes       gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy    while the industrial revolution began an era of per capita economic growth in capitalist economies    economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals  plants   and fire     the first industrial revolution evolved into the second industrial revolution in the transition years between      and       when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport  steam powered railways  boats and ships   the large scale manufacture of machine tools and the increasing use of machinery in steam powered factories           the earliest recorded use of the term  industrial revolution  seems to have been in a letter of   july      written by french envoy louis guillaume otto  announcing that france had entered the race to industrialise    in his      book keywords  a vocabulary of culture and society  raymond williams states in the entry for  industry    the idea of a new social order based on major industrial change was clear in southey and owen  between      and       and was implicit as early as blake in the early     s and wordsworth at the turn of the   th century   the term industrial revolution applied to technological change was becoming more common by the late     s  as in j r me adolphe blanqui description in      of la r volution industrielle    friedrich engels in the condition of the working class in england in      spoke of  an industrial revolution  a revolution which at the same time changed the whole of civil society   however  although engels wrote in the     s  his book was not translated into english until the late     s  and his expression did not enter everyday language until then  credit for popularising the term may be given to arnold toynbee  whose      lectures gave a detailed account of the term       some historians  such as john clapham and nicholas crafts  have argued that the economic and social changes occurred gradually and the term revolution is a misnomer  this is still a subject of debate among historians     the commencement of the industrial revolution is closely linked to a small number of innovations    beginning in the second half of the   th century  by the     s the following gains had been made in important technologies     in the late   th and early   th centuries the british government passed a series of calico acts in order to protect the domestic woolen industry from the increasing amounts of cotton fabric imported from india         the demand for heavier fabric was met by a domestic industry based around lancashire that produced fustian  a cloth with flax warp and cotton weft  flax was used for the warp because wheel spun cotton did not have sufficient strength  but the resulting blend was not as soft as      cotton and was more difficult to sew       on the eve of the industrial revolution  spinning and weaving were done in households  for domestic consumption and as a cottage industry under the putting out system  occasionally the work was done in the workshop of a master weaver  under the putting out system  home based workers produced under contract to merchant sellers  who often supplied the raw materials  in the off season the women  typically farmers  wives  did the spinning and the men did the weaving  using the spinning wheel it took anywhere from four to eight spinners to supply one hand loom weaver        the flying shuttle patented in      by john kay  with a number of subsequent improvements including an important one in       doubled the output of a weaver  worsening the imbalance between spinning and weaving  it became widely used around lancashire after      when john s son  robert  invented the drop box       lewis paul patented the roller spinning machine and the flyer and bobbin system for drawing wool to a more even thickness  the technology was developed with the help of john wyatt of birmingham  paul and wyatt opened a mill in birmingham which used their new rolling machine powered by a donkey  in       a factory opened in northampton with fifty spindles on each of five of paul and wyatt s machines  this operated until about       a similar mill was built by daniel bourn in leominster  but this burnt down  both lewis paul and daniel bourn patented carding machines in       based on two sets of rollers that travelled at different speeds  it was later used in the first cotton spinning mill  lewis s invention was later developed and improved by richard arkwright in his water frame and samuel crompton in his spinning mule     in      in the village of stanhill  lancashire  james hargreaves invented the spinning jenny  which he patented in       it was the first practical spinning frame with multiple spindles    the jenny worked in a similar manner to the spinning wheel  by first clamping down on the fibres  then by drawing them out  followed by twisting    it was a simple  wooden framed machine that only cost about    for a    spindle model in         and was used mainly by home spinners  the jenny produced a lightly twisted yarn only suitable for weft  not warp       the spinning frame or water frame was developed by richard arkwright who  along with two partners  patented it in       the design was partly based on a spinning machine built for thomas high by clock maker john kay  who was hired by arkwright    for each spindle  the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers  each operating at a successively higher rotating speed  to draw out the fibre  which was then twisted by the spindle  the roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length  too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread  the top rollers were leather covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight  the weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers  the bottom rollers were wood and metal  with fluting along the length  the water frame was able to produce a hard  medium count thread suitable for warp  finally allowing      cotton cloth to be made in britain  a horse powered the first factory to use the spinning frame  arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in cromford  derbyshire in       giving the invention its name     samuel crompton s spinning mule  introduced in       was a combination of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage  which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the drawing roller to finish drawing out the fibres as the spindles started rotating    crompton s mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost  mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp  and finally allowed britain to produce good quality calico cloth       realising that the expiration of the arkwright patent would greatly increase the supply of spun cotton and lead to a shortage of weavers  edmund cartwright developed a vertical power loom which he patented in       in      he patented a two man operated loom  that was more conventional    cartwright built two factories  the first burned down and the second was sabotaged by his workers  cartwright s loom design had several flaws  the most serious being thread breakage  samuel horrocks patented a fairly successful loom in       horock s loom was improved by richard roberts in      and these were produced in large numbers by roberts  hill   co       the demand for cotton presented an opportunity to planters in the southern united states  who thought upland cotton would be a profitable crop if a better way could be found to remove the seed  eli whitney responded to the challenge by inventing the inexpensive cotton gin  with a cotton gin a man could remove seed from as much upland cotton in one day as would have previously taken a woman working two months to process at one pound per day       other inventors increased the efficiency of the individual steps of spinning  carding  twisting and spinning  and rolling  so that the supply of yarn increased greatly  this in turn fed a weaving industry that advanced with improvements to shuttles and the loom or  frame   the output of an individual labourer increased dramatically  with the effect that the new machines were seen as a threat to employment  and early innovators were attacked and their inventions destroyed     to capitalise upon these advances  it took a class of entrepreneurs  of whom the best known is richard arkwright  he is credited with a list of inventions  but these were actually developed by such people as thomas highs and john kay  arkwright nurtured the inventors  patented the ideas  financed the initiatives  and protected the machines  he created the cotton mill which brought the production processes together in a factory  and he developed the use of power first horse power and then water power which made cotton manufacture a mechanised industry  before long steam power was applied to drive textile machinery  manchester acquired the nickname cottonopolis during the early   th century owing to its sprawl of textile factories       a major change in the metal industries during the era of the industrial revolution was the replacement of wood and other bio fuels with coal  for a given amount of heat  coal required much less labour to mine than cutting wood and converting it to charcoal    and coal was more abundant than wood      use of coal in smelting started somewhat before the industrial revolution  based on innovations by sir clement clerke and others from       using coal reverberatory furnaces known as cupolas  these were operated by the flames playing on the ore and charcoal or coke mixture  reducing the oxide to metal  this has the advantage that impurities  such as sulfur ash  in the coal do not migrate into the metal  this technology was applied to lead from      and to copper from       it was also applied to iron foundry work in the     s  but in this case the reverberatory furnace was known as an air furnace  the foundry cupola is a different  and later  innovation     this was followed by abraham darby  who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at coalbrookdale in       however  the coke pig iron he made was used mostly for the production of cast iron goods  such as pots and kettles  he had the advantage over his rivals in that his pots  cast by his patented process  were thinner and cheaper than theirs  coke pig iron was hardly used to produce bar iron in forges until the mid     s  when his son abraham darby ii built horsehay and ketley furnaces  not far from coalbrookdale   by then  coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron  since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful  it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative iron bridge in      by abraham darby iii     bar iron for smiths to forge into consumer goods was still made in finery forges  as it long had been  however  new processes were adopted in the ensuing years  the first is referred to today as potting and stamping  but this was superseded by henry cort s puddling process     henry cort developed two significant iron manufacturing processes  rolling in      and puddling in         rolling replaced hammering for consolidating wrought iron and expelling some of the dross  rolling was    times faster than hammering with a trip hammer  puddling produced a structural grade iron at a relatively low cost     puddling was a means of decarburizing pig iron by slow oxidation  with iron ore as the oxygen source  as the iron was manually stirred using a long rod  the decarburized iron  having a higher melting point than cast iron  was raked into globs by the puddler  when the glob was large enough the puddler would remove it  puddling was backbreaking and extremely hot work  few puddlers lived to be     puddling was done in a reverberatory furnace  allowing coal or coke to be used as fuel  the puddling process continued to be used until the late   th century when iron was being displaced by steel  because puddling required human skill in sensing the iron globs  it was never successfully mechanised     up to that time  british iron manufacturers had used considerable amounts of imported iron to supplement native supplies  this came principally from sweden from the mid   th century and later also from russia from the end of the     s  however  from       imports decreased because of the new iron making technology  and britain became an exporter of bar iron as well as manufactured wrought iron consumer goods     hot blast  patented by james beaumont neilson in       was the most important development of the   th century for saving energy in making pig iron  by using waste exhaust heat to preheat combustion air  the amount of fuel to make a unit of pig iron was reduced at first by between one third using coal or two thirds using coke    however  the efficiency gains continued as the technology improved    hot blast also raised the operating temperature of furnaces  increasing their capacity  using less coal or coke meant introducing fewer impurities into the pig iron  this meant that lower quality coal or anthracite could be used in areas where coking coal was unavailable or too expensive    however  by the end of the   th century transportation costs fell considerably     two decades before the industrial revolution an improvement was made in the production of steel  which was an expensive commodity and used only where iron would not do  such as for cutting edge tools and for springs  benjamin huntsman developed his crucible steel technique in the     s  the raw material for this was blister steel  made by the cementation process     the supply of cheaper iron and steel aided a number of industries  such as those making nails  hinges  wire and other hardware items  the development of machine tools allowed better working of iron  causing it to be increasingly used in the rapidly growing machinery and engine industries     the development of the stationary steam engine was an important element of the industrial revolution  however  for most of the period of the industrial revolution  the majority of industrial power was supplied by water and wind  in britain by      an estimated        horsepower was being supplied by steam  by      steam power had grown to        xa hp    small power requirements continued to be provided by animal and human muscle until the late   th century       the first real attempt at industrial use of steam power was due to thomas savery in       he constructed and patented in london a low lift combined vacuum and pressure water pump  that generated about one horsepower  hp  and was used in numerous water works and tried in a few mines  hence its  brand name   the miner s friend   savery s pump was economical in small horspower ranges  but was prone to boiler explosions in larger sizes  savery pumps continued to be produced until the late   th century     the first successful piston steam engine was introduced by thomas newcomen before       a number of newcomen engines were successfully put to use in britain for draining hitherto unworkable deep mines  with the engine on the surface  these were large machines  requiring a lot of capital to build  and produced about  xa hp     xa kw   they were extremely inefficient by modern standards  but when located where coal was cheap at pit heads  opened up a great expansion in coal mining by allowing mines to go deeper  despite their disadvantages  newcomen engines were reliable and easy to maintain and continued to be used in the coalfields until the early decades of the   th century  by       when newcomen died  his engines had spread  first  to hungary in       germany  austria  and sweden  a total of     are known to have been built by      when the joint patent expired  of which    were abroad  in the     s  the engineer john smeaton built some very large examples and introduced a number of improvements  a total of       engines had been built by            a fundamental change in working principles was brought about by scotsman james watt  in close collaboration with englishman matthew boulton  he had succeeded by      in perfecting his steam engine  which incorporated a series of radical improvements  notably the closing off of the upper part of the cylinder thereby making the low pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere  use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate steam condenser chamber  the separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder  which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam  likewise  the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder  also improving efficiency  these improvements increased engine efficiency so that boulton   watts engines used only        as much coal per horsepower hour as newcomen s  boulton and watt opened the soho foundry  for the manufacture of such engines  in          by      the watt steam engine had been fully developed into a double acting rotative type  which meant that it could be used to directly drive the rotary machinery of a factory or mill  both of watt s basic engine types were commercially very successful  and by       the firm boulton   watt had constructed     engines  with     driving reciprocating pumps     serving blast furnaces  and     powering mill machinery  most of the engines generated from   to   xa hp     xa kw      the development of machine tools  such as the lathe  planing and shaping machines powered by these engines  enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn made it possible to build larger and more powerful engines     until about       the most common pattern of steam engine was the beam engine  built as an integral part of a stone or brick engine house  but soon various patterns of self contained portative engines  readily removable  but not on wheels  were developed  such as the table engine  around the start of the   th century  the cornish engineer richard trevithick  and the american  oliver evans began to construct higher pressure non condensing steam engines  exhausting against the atmosphere  this allowed an engine and boiler to be combined into a single unit compact enough to be used on mobile road and rail locomotives and steam boats     in the early   th century after the expiration of watt s patent  the steam engine underwent many improvements by a host of inventors and engineers     the industrial revolution created a demand for metal parts used in machinery  this led to the development of several machine tools for cutting metal parts  they have their origins in the tools developed in the   th century by makers of clocks and watches and scientific instrument makers to enable them to batch produce small mechanisms     before the advent of machine tools  metal was worked manually using the basic hand tools of hammers  files  scrapers  saws and chisels  consequently  the use of metal was kept to a minimum  wooden components had the disadvantage of changing dimensions with temperature and humidity  and the various joints tended to rack  work loose  over time  as the industrial revolution progressed  machines with metal parts and frames became more common  hand methods of production were very laborious and costly and precision was difficult to achieve  pre industrial machinery was built by various craftsmen millwrights built water and wind mills  carpenters made wooden framing  and smiths and turners made metal parts     the first large machine tool was the cylinder boring machine used for boring the large diameter cylinders on early steam engines  the planing machine  the milling machine and the shaping machine were developed in the early decades of the   th century  although the milling machine was invented at this time  it was not developed as a serious workshop tool until somewhat later in the   th century     henry maudslay  who trained a school of machine tool makers early in the   th century  was a mechanic with superior ability who had been employed at the royal arsenal  woolwich  he was hired away by joseph bramah for the production of high security metal locks that required precision craftsmanship  bramah patented a lathe that had similarities to the slide rest lathe  maudslay perfected the slide rest lathe  which could cut machine screws of different thread pitches by using changeable gears between the spindle and the lead screw  before its invention screws could not be cut to any precision using various earlier lathe designs  some of which copied from a template    maudslay s lathe was called one of history s most important inventions     maudslay left bramah s employment and set up his own shop  he was engaged to build the machinery for making ships  pulley blocks for the royal navy in the portsmouth block mills  these machines were all metal and were the first machines for mass production and making components with a degree of interchangeability  the lessons maudslay learned about the need for stability and precision he adapted to the development of machine tools  and in his workshops he trained a generation of men to build on his work  such as richard roberts  joseph clement and joseph whitworth     james fox of derby had a healthy export trade in machine tools for the first third of the century  as did matthew murray of leeds  roberts was a maker of high quality machine tools and a pioneer of the use of jigs and gauges for precision workshop measurement     the impact of machine tools during the industrial revolution was not that great because other than firearms  threaded fasteners and a few other industries there were few mass produced metal parts    in the half century following the invention of the fundamental machine tools the machine industry became the largest industrial sector of the economy  by value added  in the u s       the large scale production of chemicals was an important development during the industrial revolution  the first of these was the production of sulphuric acid by the lead chamber process invented by the englishman john roebuck  james watt s first partner  in       he was able to greatly increase the scale of the manufacture by replacing the relatively expensive glass vessels formerly used with larger  less expensive chambers made of riveted sheets of lead  instead of making a small amount each time  he was able to make around     pounds    xa kg  in each of the chambers  at least a tenfold increase     the production of an alkali on a large scale became an important goal as well  and nicolas leblanc succeeded in      in introducing a method for the production of sodium carbonate  the leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid  the sodium sulphate was heated with limestone  calcium carbonate  and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide  adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide  the process produced a large amount of pollution  the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air  and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product   nonetheless  this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants  barilla  or from kelp  which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash    and also to potash  potassium carbonate  derived from hardwood ashes     these two chemicals were very important because they enabled the introduction of a host of other inventions  replacing many small scale operations with more cost effective and controllable processes  sodium carbonate had many uses in the glass  textile  soap  and paper industries  early uses for sulphuric acid included pickling  removing rust  iron and steel  and for bleaching cloth     the development of bleaching powder  calcium hypochlorite  by scottish chemist charles tennant in about       based on the discoveries of french chemist claude louis berthollet  revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required  from months to days  for the traditional process then in use  which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or sour milk  tennant s factory at st rollox  north glasgow  became the largest chemical plant in the world     after      the focus on chemical innovation was in dyestuffs  and germany took world leadership  building a strong chemical industry    aspring chemists flocked to german universities in the           era to learn the latest techniques  british scientists by contrast  lacked research universities and did not train advanced students  instead the practice was to hire german trained chemists       in      joseph aspdin  a british bricklayer turned builder  patented a chemical process for making portland cement which was an important advance in the building trades  this process involves sintering a mixture of clay and limestone to about      xa  c       xa  f   then grinding it into a fine powder which is then mixed with water  sand and gravel to produce concrete  portland cement was used by the famous english engineer marc isambard brunel several years later when constructing the thames tunnel    cement was used on a large scale in the construction of the london sewerage system a generation later     another major industry of the later industrial revolution was gas lighting  though others made a similar innovation elsewhere  the large scale introduction of this was the work of william murdoch  an employee of boulton and watt  the birmingham steam engine pioneers  the process consisted of the large scale gasification of coal in furnaces  the purification of the gas  removal of sulphur  ammonia  and heavy hydrocarbons   and its storage and distribution  the first gas lighting utilities were established in london between      and       they soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the uk  gas lighting had an impact on social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil  its introduction allowed night life to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before     a new method of producing glass  known as the cylinder process  was developed in europe during the early   th century  in       this process was used by the chance brothers to create sheet glass  they became the leading producers of window and plate glass  this advancement allowed for larger panes of glass to be created without interruption  thus freeing up the space planning in interiors as well as the fenestration of buildings  the crystal palace is the supreme example of the use of sheet glass in a new and innovative structure      a machine for making a continuous sheet of paper on a loop of wire fabric was patented in      by nicholas louis robert who worked for saint l ger didot family in france  the paper machine is known as a fourdrinier after the financiers  brothers sealy and henry fourdrinier  who were stationers in london  although greatly improved and with many variations  the fourdriner machine is the predominant means of paper production today     the method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes       the british agricultural revolution is considered one of the causes of the industrial revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy       industrial technologies that affected farming included the seed drill  the dutch plough  which contained iron parts  and the threshing machine     jethro tull invented an improved seed drill in       it was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and planted them at the correct depth  this was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five  tull s seed drill was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore did not have much of an impact  good quality seed drills were not produced until the mid   th century       joseph foljambe s rotherham plough of       was the first commercially successful iron plough          the threshing machine  invented by andrew meikle in       displaced hand threshing with a flail  a laborious job that took about one quarter of agricultural labour    it took several decades to diffuse   and was the final straw for many farm labourers  who faced near starvation  leading to the      agricultural rebellion of the swing riots     machine tools and metalworking techniques developed during the industrial revolution eventually resulted in precision manufacturing techniques in the late   th century for mass producing agricultural equipment  such as reapers  binders and combine harvesters       coal mining in britain  particularly in south wales started early  before the steam engine  pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface  which were abandoned as the coal was extracted  in other cases  if the geology was favourable  the coal was mined by means of an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill  shaft mining was done in some areas  but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water  it could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough  a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine   in either case  the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could flow away by gravity  the introduction of the steam pump by savery in      and the newcomen steam engine in      greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper  enabling more coal to be extracted  these were developments that had begun before the industrial revolution  but the adoption of john smeaton s improvements to the newcomen engine followed by james watt s more efficient steam engines from the     s reduced the fuel costs of engines  making mines more profitable     coal mining was very dangerous owing to the presence of firedamp in many coal seams  some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in      by sir humphry davy and independently by george stephenson  however  the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light  firedamp explosions continued  often setting off coal dust explosions  so casualties grew during the entire   th century  conditions of work were very poor  with a high casualty rate from rock falls     other developments included more efficient water wheels  based on experiments conducted by the british engineer john smeaton   the beginnings of a machine industry     and the rediscovery of concrete  based on hydraulic lime mortar  by john smeaton  which had been lost for      years       at the beginning of the industrial revolution  inland transport was by navigable rivers and roads  with coastal vessels employed to move heavy goods by sea  wagon ways were used for conveying coal to rivers for further shipment  but canals had not yet been widely constructed  animals supplied all of the motive power on land  with sails providing the motive power on the sea  the first horse railways were introduced toward the end of the   th century  with steam locomotives being introduced in the early decades of the   th century     the industrial revolution improved britain s transport infrastructure with a turnpike road network  a canal and waterway network  and a railway network  raw materials and finished products could be moved more quickly and cheaply than before  improved transportation also allowed new ideas to spread quickly     canals were the first technology to allow bulk materials to be economically transported long distances inland  this was because a horse could pull a barge with a load dozens of times larger than the load that was pullable in a cart cart         building of canals dates to ancient times  the grand canal in china   the world s largest artificial waterway and oldest canal still in existence   parts of which were started between the  th and  th centuries bc  is       miles       xa km  long and links hangzhou with beijing       in the uk  canals began to be built in the late   th century to link the major manufacturing centres across the country  known for its huge commercial success  the bridgewater canal in north west england  which opened in      and was mostly funded by the  rd duke of bridgewater  from worsley to the rapidly growing town of manchester its construction cost                       as of            but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in       the price of coal in manchester fell by about half    this success helped inspire a period of intense canal building  known as canal mania    new canals were hastily built in the aim of replicating the commercial success of the bridgewater canal  the most notable being the leeds and liverpool canal and the thames and severn canal which opened in      and      respectively     by the     s  a national network was in existence  canal construction served as a model for the organisation and methods later used to construct the railways  they were eventually largely superseded as profitable commercial enterprises by the spread of the railways from the     s on  the last major canal to be built in the united kingdom was the manchester ship canal  which upon opening in      was the largest ship canal in the world    and opened manchester as a port  however it never achieved the commercial success its sponsors had hoped for and signalled canals as a dying mode of transport in an age dominated by railways  which were quicker and often cheaper     britain s canal network  together with its surviving mill buildings  is one of the most enduring features of the early industrial revolution to be seen in britain     much of the original british road system was poorly maintained by thousands of local parishes  but from the     s  and occasionally earlier  turnpike trusts were set up to charge tolls and maintain some roads  increasing numbers of main roads were turnpiked from the     s to the extent that almost every main road in england and wales was the responsibility of a turnpike trust  new engineered roads were built by john metcalf  thomas telford and most notably john mcadam  with the first  macadamised  stretch of road being marsh road at ashton gate  bristol in         the major turnpikes radiated from london and were the means by which the royal mail was able to reach the rest of the country  heavy goods transport on these roads was by means of slow  broad wheeled  carts hauled by teams of horses  lighter goods were conveyed by smaller carts or by teams of pack horse  stage coaches carried the rich  and the less wealthy could pay to ride on carriers carts     wagonways for moving coal in the mining areas had started in the   th century and were often associated with canal or river systems for the further movement of coal  these were all horse drawn or relied on gravity  with a stationary steam engine to haul the wagons back to the top of the incline  the first applications of the steam locomotive were on wagon or plate ways  as they were then often called from the cast iron plates used   horse drawn public railways did not begin until the early years of the   th century when improvements to pig and wrought iron production were lowering costs  see  metallurgy    reducing friction was one of the major reasons for the success of railroads compared to wagons  this was demonstrated on an iron plate covered wooden tramway in      at croydon  u k       a good horse on an ordinary turnpike road can draw two thousand pounds  or one ton  a party of gentlemen were invited to witness the experiment  that the superiority of the new road might be established by ocular demonstration  twelve wagons were loaded with stones  till each wagon weighed three tons  and the wagons were fastened together  a horse was then attached  which drew the wagons with ease  six miles in two hours  having stopped four times  in order to show he had the power of starting  as well as drawing his great load        steam locomotives began being built after the introduction of high pressure steam engines around       these engines exhausted used steam to the atmosphere  doing away with the condenser and cooling water  they were also much lighter weight and smaller in size for a given horsepower than the stationary condensing engines  a few of these early locomotives were used in mines  steam hauled public railways began with the stockton and darlington railway in          on    september       the liverpool and manchester railway was opened  the first inter city railway in the world and was attended by prime minister  the duke of wellington    the railway was engineered by joseph locke and george stephenson  linked the rapidly expanding industrial town of manchester with the port town of liverpool  the opening was marred by problems  due to the primitive nature of the technology being employed  however problems were gradually ironed out and the railway became highly successful  transporting passengers and freight  the success of the inter city railway  particularly in the transport of freight and commodities  led to railway mania     construction of major railways connecting the larger cities and towns began in the     s but only gained momentum at the very end of the first industrial revolution  after many of the workers had completed the railways  they did not return to their rural lifestyles but instead remained in the cities  providing additional workers for the factories     the effects on living conditions the industrial revolution have been very controversial  and were hotly debated by economic and social historians from the     s to the     s    a series of     s essays by henry phelps brown and sheila v  hopkins later set the academic consensus that the bulk of the population  that was at the bottom of the social ladder  suffered severe reductions in their living standards    during            there was a significant increase in worker wages           some economists  such as robert e  lucas  jr   say that the real impact of the industrial revolution was that  for the first time in history  the living standards of the masses of ordinary people have begun to undergo sustained growthxa     nothing remotely like this economic behavior is mentioned by the classical economists  even as a theoretical possibility    others  however  argue that while growth of the economy s overall productive powers was unprecedented during the industrial revolution  living standards for the majority of the population did not grow meaningfully until the late   th and   th centuries  and that in many ways workers  living standards declined under early capitalism  for instance  studies have shown that real wages in britain only increased     between the     s and     s  and that life expectancy in britain did not begin to dramatically increase until the     s       chronic hunger and malnutrition were the norm for the majority of the population of the world including britain and france  until the late   th century  until about       in large part due to malnutrition  life expectancy in france was about    years  and only slightly higher in britain  the us population of the time was adequately fed  much taller on average and had life expectancy of       years       in britain and the netherlands  food supply had been increasing and prices falling before the industrial revolution due to better agricultural practices  however  population grew too  as noted by thomas malthus          before the industrial revolution  advances in agriculture or technology soon led to an increase in population  which again strained food and other resources  limiting increases in per capita income  this condition is called the malthusian trap  and it was finally overcome by industrialisation       transportation improvements  such as canals and improved roads  also lowered food costs  railroads were introduced near the end of the industrial revolution     living conditions during the industrial revolution varied from splendour for factory owners to squalor for workers citation needed    in the condition of the working class in england in      friedrich engels described backstreet sections of manchester and other mill towns  where people lived in crude shanties and shacks  some not completely enclosed  some with dirt floors  these shantytowns had narrow walkways between irregularly shaped lots and dwellings  there were no sanitary facilities  population density was extremely high  eight to ten unrelated mill workers often shared a room  often with no furniture  and slept on a pile of straw or sawdust    toilet facilities were shared if they existed  disease spread through a contaminated water supply  also  people were at risk of developing pathologies due to persistent dampness     the famines that troubled rural areas did not happen in industrial areas  but urban people especially small children died due to diseases spreading through the cramped living conditions  tuberculosis  spread in congested dwellings   lung diseases from the mines  cholera from polluted water and typhoid were also common     not everyone lived in such poor conditions  the industrial revolution also created a middle class of professionals  such as lawyers and doctors  who lived in much better conditions     conditions improved over the course of the   th century due to new public health acts regulating things such as sewage  hygiene and home construction  in the introduction of his      edition  engels notes that most of the conditions he wrote about in      had been greatly improved     consumers benefited from falling prices for clothing and household articles such as cast iron cooking utensils  and in the following decades  stoves for cooking and space heating     according to robert hughes in the fatal shore  the population of england and wales  which had remained steady at   million from      to       rose dramatically after       the population of england had more than doubled from     million in      to      million in      and  by       had nearly doubled again to      million    improved conditions led to the population of britain increasing from    million to    million in the     s      europe s population increased from about     million in      to     million by            the industrial revolution was the first period in history during which there was a simultaneous increase in population and in per capita income       in terms of social structure  the industrial revolution witnessed the triumph of a middle class of industrialists and businessmen over a landed class of nobility and gentry  ordinary working people found increased opportunities for employment in the new mills and factories  but these were often under strict working conditions with long hours of labour dominated by a pace set by machines  as late as the year       most industrial workers in the united states still worked a    hour day     hours in the steel industry   yet earned from     to     less than the minimum deemed necessary for a decent life    however  harsh working conditions were prevalent long before the industrial revolution took place  pre industrial society was very static and often cruel child labour  dirty living conditions  and long working hours were just as prevalent before the industrial revolution       industrialisation led to the creation of the factory  arguably the first highly mechanised was john lombe s water powered silk mill at derby  operational by       lombe learned silk thread manufacturing by taking a job in italy and acting as an industrial spy  however  since the silk industry there was a closely guarded secret  the state of the industry there is unknown  because lombe s factory was not successful and there was no follow through  the rise of the modern factory dates to somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanised     the factory system contributed to the growth of urban areas  as large numbers of workers migrated into the cities in search of work in the factories  nowhere was this better illustrated than the mills and associated industries of manchester  nicknamed  cottonopolis   and the world s first industrial city    manchester experienced a six times increase in its population between      and       bradford grew by     every ten years between      and      and by      only     of the population of bradford was actually born there       for much of the   th century  production was done in small mills  which were typically water powered and built to serve local needs  later  each factory would have its own steam engine and a chimney to give an efficient draft through its boiler     the transition to industrialisation was not without difficulty  for example  a group of english workers known as luddites formed to protest against industrialisation and sometimes sabotaged factories     in other industries the transition to factory production was not so divisive  some industrialists themselves tried to improve factory and living conditions for their workers  one of the earliest such reformers was robert owen  known for his pioneering efforts in improving conditions for workers at the new lanark mills  and often regarded as one of the key thinkers of the early socialist movement     by       an integrated brass mill was working at warmley near bristol  raw material went in at one end  was smelted into brass and was turned into pans  pins  wire  and other goods  housing was provided for workers on site  josiah wedgwood and matthew boulton  whose soho manufactory was completed in       were other prominent early industrialists  who employed the factory system     the industrial revolution led to a population increase but the chances of surviving childhood did not improve throughout the industrial revolution  although infant mortality rates were reduced markedly        there was still limited opportunity for education and children were expected to work  employers could pay a child less than an adult even though their productivity was comparable  there was no need for strength to operate an industrial machine  and since the industrial system was completely new  there were no experienced adult labourers  this made child labour the labour of choice for manufacturing in the early phases of the industrial revolution between the   th and   th centuries  in england and scotland in       two thirds of the workers in     water powered cotton mills were described as children        child labour existed before the industrial revolution but with the increase in population and education it became more visible  many children were forced to work in relatively bad conditions for much lower pay than their elders             of an adult male s wage     children as young as four were employed     beatings and long hours were common  with some child coal miners and hurriers working from  am until  pm     conditions were dangerous  with some children killed when they dozed off and fell into the path of the carts  while others died from gas explosions     many children developed lung cancer and other diseases and died before the age of        workhouses would sell orphans and abandoned children as  pauper apprentices   working without wages for board and lodging     those who ran away would be whipped and returned to their masters  with some masters shackling them to prevent escape     children employed as mule scavengers by cotton mills would crawl under machinery to pick up cotton  working    hours a day  six days a week  some lost hands or limbs  others were crushed under the machines  and some were decapitated     young girls worked at match factories  where phosphorus fumes would cause many to develop phossy jaw     children employed at glassworks were regularly burned and blinded  and those working at potteries were vulnerable to poisonous clay dust        reports were written detailing some of the abuses  particularly in the coal mines    and textile factories     and these helped to popularise the children s plight  the public outcry  especially among the upper and middle classes  helped stir change in the young workers  welfare     politicians and the government tried to limit child labour by law but factory owners resisted  some felt that they were aiding the poor by giving their children money to buy food to avoid starvation  and others simply welcomed the cheap labour  in      and       the first general laws against child labour  the factory acts  were passed in britain  children younger than nine were not allowed to work  children were not permitted to work at night  and the work day of youth under the age of    was limited to twelve hours  factory inspectors supervised the execution of the law  however  their scarcity made enforcement difficult     about ten years later  the employment of children and women in mining was forbidden  these laws decreased the number of child labourers  however child labour remained in europe and the united states up to the   th century        the rapid industrialisation of the english economy cost many craft workers their jobs  the movement started first with lace and hosiery workers near nottingham and spread to other areas of the textile industry owing to early industrialisation  many weavers also found themselves suddenly unemployed since they could no longer compete with machines which only required relatively limited  and unskilled  labour to produce more cloth than a single weaver  many such unemployed workers  weavers and others  turned their animosity towards the machines that had taken their jobs and began destroying factories and machinery  these attackers became known as luddites  supposedly followers of ned ludd  a folklore figure  the first attacks of the luddite movement began in       the luddites rapidly gained popularity  and the british government took drastic measures  using the militia or army to protect industry  those rioters who were caught were tried and hanged  or transported for life     unrest continued in other sectors as they industrialised  such as with agricultural labourers in the     s when large parts of southern britain were affected by the captain swing disturbances  threshing machines were a particular target  and hayrick burning was a popular activity  however  the riots led to the first formation of trade unions  and further pressure for reform     the industrial revolution concentrated labour into mills  factories and mines  thus facilitating the organisation of combinations or trade unions to help advance the interests of working people  the power of a union could demand better terms by withdrawing all labour and causing a consequent cessation of production  employers had to decide between giving in to the union demands at a cost to themselves or suffering the cost of the lost production  skilled workers were hard to replace  and these were the first groups to successfully advance their conditions through this kind of bargaining     the main method the unions used to effect change was strike action  many strikes were painful events for both sides  the unions and the management  in britain  the combination act      forbade workers to form any kind of trade union until its repeal in       even after this  unions were still severely restricted     in       the reform act extended the vote in britain but did not grant universal suffrage  that year six men from tolpuddle in dorset founded the friendly society of agricultural labourers to protest against the gradual lowering of wages in the     s  they refused to work for less than    shillings a week  although by this time wages had been reduced to   shillings a week and were due to be further reduced to    in      james frampton  a local landowner  wrote to the prime minister  lord melbourne  to complain about the union  invoking an obscure law from      prohibiting people from swearing oaths to each other  which the members of the friendly society had done  james brine  james hammett  george loveless  george s brother james loveless  george s brother in law thomas standfield  and thomas s son john standfield were arrested  found guilty  and transported to australia  they became known as the tolpuddle martyrs  in the     s and     s the chartist movement was the first large scale organised working class political movement which campaigned for political equality and social justice  its charter of reforms received over three million signatures but was rejected by parliament without consideration     working people also formed friendly societies and co operative societies as mutual support groups against times of economic hardship  enlightened industrialists  such as robert owen also supported these organisations to improve the conditions of the working class     unions slowly overcame the legal restrictions on the right to strike  in       a general strike involving cotton workers and colliers was organised through the chartist movement which stopped production across great britain        eventually  effective political organisation for working people was achieved through the trades unions who  after the extensions of the franchise in      and       began to support socialist political parties that later merged to became the british labour party     the application of steam power to the industrial processes of printing supported a massive expansion of newspaper and popular book publishing  which reinforced rising literacy and demands for mass political participation     during the industrial revolution  the life expectancy of children increased dramatically  the percentage of the children born in london who died before the age of five decreased from       in           to       in                  the growth of modern industry since the late   th century led to massive urbanisation and the rise of new great cities  first in europe and then in other regions  as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas  in       only    of the world s population lived in cities     compared to nearly     today  the beginning of the   st century      manchester had a population of        in       but by      it had burgeoned to     million        eric hobsbawm held that the industrial revolution began in britain in the     s and was not fully felt until the     s or     s   while t  s  ashton held that it occurred roughly between      and        the industrial revolution on continental europe came a little later than in great britain  in many industries  this involved the application of technology developed in britain in new places  often the technology was purchased from britain or british engineers and entrepreneurs moved abroad in search of new opportunities  by       part of the ruhr valley in westphalia was called  miniature england  because of its similarities to the industrial areas of england  the german  russian and belgian governments all provided state funding to the new industries  in some cases  such as iron   the different availability of resources locally meant that only some aspects of the british technology were adopted     belgium was the second country  after britain  in which the industrial revolution took place and the first in continental europe  wallonia  french speaking southern belgium  was the first region to follow the british model successfully  starting in the middle of the     s  and especially after belgium became an independent nation in       numerous works comprising coke blast furnaces as well as puddling and rolling mills were built in the coal mining areas around li ge and charleroi  the leader was a transplanted englishman john cockerill  his factories at seraing integrated all stages of production  from engineering to the supply of raw materials  as early as             wallonia exemplified the radical evolution of industrial expansion  thanks to coal  the french word  houille  was coined in wallonia      the region geared up to become the  nd industrial power in the world after britain  but it is also pointed out by many researchers  with its sillon industriel   especially in the haine  sambre and meuse valleys  between the borinage and li ge        there was a huge industrial development based on coal mining and iron making         philippe raxhon wrote about the period after        it was not propaganda but a reality the walloon regions were becoming the second industrial power all over the world after britain       the sole industrial centre outside the collieries and blast furnaces of walloon was the old cloth making town of ghent      michel de coster  professor at the universit  de li ge wrote also   the historians and the economists say that belgium was the second industrial power of the world  in proportion to its population and its territory       but this rank is the one of wallonia where the coal mines  the blast furnaces  the iron and zinc factories  the wool industry  the glass industry  the weapons industry    were concentrated         wallonia was also the birthplace of a strong socialist party and strong trade unions in a particular sociological landscape  at the left  the sillon industriel  which runs from mons in the west  to verviers in the east  except part of north flanders  in another period of the industrial revolution  after        even if belgium is the second industrial country after britain  the effect of the industrial revolution there was very different  in  breaking stereotypes   muriel neven and isabelle devious say     the industrial revolution changed a mainly rural society into an urban one  but with a strong contrast between northern and southern belgium  during the middle ages and the early modern period  flanders was characterised by the presence of large urban centres       at the beginning of the nineteenth century this region  flanders   with an urbanisation degree of more than    per cent  remained one of the most urbanised in the world  by comparison  this proportion reached only    per cent in wallonia  barely    per cent in most west european countries     per cent in france and    per cent in britain  nineteenth century industrialisation did not affect the traditional urban infrastructure  except in ghent       also  in wallonia the traditional urban network was largely unaffected by the industrialisation process  even though the proportion of city dwellers rose from    to    per cent between      and       especially in the haine  sambre and meuse valleys  between the borinage and li ge  where there was a huge industrial development based on coal mining and iron making  urbanisation was fast  during these eighty years the number of municipalities with more than       inhabitants increased from only    to more than one hundred  concentrating nearly half of the walloon population in this region  nevertheless  industrialisation remained quite traditional in the sense that it did not lead to the growth of modern and large urban centres  but to a conurbation of industrial villages and towns developed around a coal mine or a factory  communication routes between these small centres only became populated later and created a much less dense urban morphology than  for instance  the area around li ge where the old town was there to direct migratory flows        the industrial revolution in france followed a particular course as it did not correspond to the main model followed by other countries  notably  most french historians argue france did not go through a clear take off     instead  france s economic growth and industrialisation process was slow and steady through the   th and   th centuries  however  some stages were identified by maurice l vy leboyer     based on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories  germany became dominant in the world s chemical industry in the late   th century  at first the production of dyes based on aniline was critical        germany s political disunity with three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the     s  however  by the     s  trunk lines linked the major cities  each german state was responsible for the lines within its own borders  lacking a technological base at first  the germans imported their engineering and hardware from britain  but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways  in many cities  the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training  so that by       germany was self sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction  and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry  observers found that even as late as       their engineering was inferior to britain s  however  german unification in      stimulated consolidation  nationalisation into state owned companies  and further rapid growth  unlike the situation in france  the goal was support of industrialisation  and so heavy lines crisscrossed the ruhr and other industrial districts  and provided good connections to the major ports of hamburg and bremen  by       germany had       locomotives pulling        passengers and        tons of freight  and pulled ahead of france       during the period           sweden experienced two parallel economic movements  an agricultural revolution with larger agricultural estates  new crops and farming tools and a commercialisation of farming  and a protoindustrialisation  with small industries being established in the countryside and with workers switching between agricultural work in summer and industrial production in winter  this led to economic growth benefiting large sections of the population and leading up to a consumption revolution starting in the     s     during           the protoindustries developed into more specialized and larger industries  this period witnessed increasing regional specialisation with mining in bergslagen  textile mills in sjuh radsbygden and forestry in norrland  several important institutional changes took place in this period  such as free and mandatory schooling introduced       as first country in the world   the abolition of the national monopoly on trade in handicrafts in       and a stock company law in          during            sweden experienced a veritable explosion in export  dominated by crops  wood and steel  sweden abolished most tariffs and other barriers to free trade in the     s and joined the gold standard in          during            sweden experienced the second industrial revolution  new industries developed with their focus on the domestic market  mechanical engineering  power utilities  papermaking and textile     the united states originally used horse powered machinery to power its earliest factories  but eventually switched to water power  as a result  industrialisation was essentially limited to new england and the rest of northeastern united states  which has fast moving rivers  the newer water powered production lines proved more economical than horse drawn production  however  raw materials  especially cotton  came from the southern united states  it was not until after the civil war in the     s that steam powered manufacturing overtook water powered manufacturing  allowing the industry to fully spread across the nation     thomas somers and the cabot brothers founded the beverly cotton manufactory in       the first cotton mill in america  the largest cotton mill of its era     and a significant milestone in the research and development of cotton mills in the future  this mill was designed to use horse power  but the operators quickly learned that the horse drawn platform was economically unstable  and had economic losses for years  despite the losses  the manufactory served as a playground of innovation  both in turning a large amount of cotton  but also developing the water powered milling structure used in slater s mill        in       samuel slater             founded the slater mill at pawtucket  rhode island  he had learned of the new textile technologies as a boy apprentice in derbyshire  england  and defied laws against the emigration of skilled workers by leaving for new york in       hoping to make money with his knowledge  after founding slater s mill  he went on to own    textile mills     daniel day established a wool carding mill in the blackstone valley at uxbridge  massachusetts in       the third woollen mill established in the us  the first was in hartford  connecticut  and the second at watertown  massachusetts   the john h  chafee blackstone river valley national heritage corridor retraces the history of  america s hardest working river   the blackstone  the blackstone river and its tributaries  which cover more than    miles    xa km  from worcester  massachusetts to providence  rhode island  was the birthplace of america s industrial revolution  at its peak over      mills operated in this valley  including slater s mill  and with it the earliest beginnings of america s industrial and technological development     merchant francis cabot lowell from newburyport  massachusetts memorised the design of textile machines on his tour of british factories in       realising that the war of      had ruined his import business but that a demand for domestic finished cloth was emerging in america  on his return to the united states  he set up the boston manufacturing company  lowell and his partners built america s second cotton to cloth textile mill at waltham  massachusetts  second to the beverly cotton manufactory  after his death in       his associates built america s first planned factory town  which they named after him  this enterprise was capitalised in a public stock offering  one of the first uses of it in the united states  lowell  massachusetts  using     miles     xa km  of canals and        horsepower delivered by the merrimack river  is considered by some as a major contributor to the success of the american industrial revolution  the short lived utopia like waltham lowell system was formed  as a direct response to the poor working conditions in britain  however  by       especially following the irish potato famine  the system had been replaced by poor immigrant labour     the industrialisation of the watch industry started      also in waltham  massachusetts  at the waltham watch company  with the development of machine tools  gauges and assembling methods adapted to the micro precision required for watches     the industrial revolution began about      as meiji period leaders decided to catch up with the west  the government built railroads  improved roads  and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development  it inaugurated a new western based education system for all young people  sent thousands of students to the united states and europe  and hired more than       westerners to teach modern science  mathematics  technology  and foreign languages in japan  o yatoi gaikokujin      in       a group of japanese politicians known as the iwakura mission toured europe and the usa to learn western ways  the result was a deliberate state led industrialisation policy to enable japan to quickly catch up  the bank of japan  founded in       used taxes to fund model steel and textile factories  education was expanded and japanese students were sent to study in the west     modern industry first appeared in textiles  including cotton and especially silk  which was based in home workshops in rural areas        steel is often cited as the first of several new areas for industrial mass production  which are said to characterise a  second industrial revolution   beginning around       although a method for mass manufacture of steel was not invented until the     s  when sir henry bessemer invented a new furnace which could convert molten pig iron into steel in large quantities  however  it only became widely available in the     s after the process was modified to produce more uniform quality        bessemer steel was being displaced by the open hearth furnace near the end of the   th century     this second industrial revolution gradually grew to include chemicals  mainly the chemical industries  petroleum  refining and distribution   and  in the   th century  the automotive industries  and was marked by a transition of technological leadership from britain to the united states and germany     the increasing availability of economical petroleum products also reduced the importance of coal and further widened the potential for industrialisation     a new revolution began with electricity and electrification in the electrical industries  the introduction of hydroelectric power generation in the alps enabled the rapid industrialisation of coal deprived northern italy  beginning in the     s     by the     s  industrialisation in these areas had created the first giant industrial corporations with burgeoning global interests  as companies like u s  steel  general electric  standard oil and bayer ag joined the railroad and ship companies on the world s stock markets     the advent of the age of enlightenment provided an intellectual framework which welcomed the practical application of the growing body of scientific knowledge a factor evidenced in the systematic development of the steam engine  guided by scientific analysis  and the development of the political and sociological analyses  culminating in scottish economist adam smith s the wealth of nations  one of the main arguments for capitalism  presented for example in the book the improving state of the world  is that industrialisation increases wealth for all  as evidenced by raised life expectancy  reduced working hours  and no work for children and the elderly     socialism emerged as a critique of capitalism  marxism began essentially as a reaction to the industrial revolution     according to karl marx  industrialisation polarised society into the bourgeoisie  those who own the means of production  the factories and the land  and the much larger proletariat  the working class who actually perform the labour necessary to extract something valuable from the means of production   he saw the industrialisation process as the logical dialectical progression of feudal economic modes  necessary for the full development of capitalism  which he saw as in itself a necessary precursor to the development of socialism and eventually communism     during the industrial revolution an intellectual and artistic hostility towards the new industrialisation developed  associated with the romantic movement  its major exponents in english included the artist and poet william blake and poets william wordsworth  samuel taylor coleridge  john keats  lord byron and percy bysshe shelley  the movement stressed the importance of  nature  in art and language  in contrast to  monstrous  machines and factories  the  dark satanic mills  of blake s poem  and did those feet in ancient time   mary shelley s novel frankenstein reflected concerns that scientific progress might be two edged     the causes of the industrial revolution were complicated and remain a topic for debate  with some historians believing the revolution was an outgrowth of social and institutional changes brought by the end of feudalism in britain after the english civil war in the   th century  as national border controls became more effective  the spread of disease was lessened  thereby preventing the epidemics common in previous times     the percentage of children who lived past infancy rose significantly  leading to a larger workforce  the enclosure movement and the british agricultural revolution made food production more efficient and less labour intensive  forcing the surplus population who could no longer find employment in agriculture into cottage industry  for example weaving  and in the longer term into the cities and the newly developed factories     the colonial expansion of the   th century with the accompanying development of international trade  creation of financial markets and accumulation of capital are also cited as factors  as is the scientific revolution of the   th century        until the     s  it was universally believed by academic historians that technological innovation was the heart of the industrial revolution and the key enabling technology was the invention and improvement of the steam engine     however  recent research into the marketing era has challenged the traditional  supply oriented interpretation of the industrial revolution        lewis mumford has proposed that the industrial revolution had its origins in the early middle ages  much earlier than most estimates     he explains that the model for standardised mass production was the printing press and that  the archetypal model for the industrial era was the clock   he also cites the monastic emphasis on order and time keeping  as well as the fact that medieval cities had at their centre a church with bell ringing at regular intervals as being necessary precursors to a greater synchronisation necessary for later  more physical  manifestations such as the steam engine     the presence of a large domestic market should also be considered an important driver of the industrial revolution  particularly explaining why it occurred in britain  in other nations  such as france  markets were split up by local regions  which often imposed tolls and tariffs on goods traded among them     internal tariffs were abolished by henry viii of england  they survived in russia till            in france and      in spain     governments  grant of limited monopolies to inventors under a developing patent system  the statute of monopolies in       is considered an influential factor  the effects of patents  both good and ill  on the development of industrialisation are clearly illustrated in the history of the steam engine  the key enabling technology  in return for publicly revealing the workings of an invention the patent system rewarded inventors such as james watt by allowing them to monopolise the production of the first steam engines  thereby rewarding inventors and increasing the pace of technological development  however  monopolies bring with them their own inefficiencies which may counterbalance  or even overbalance  the beneficial effects of publicising ingenuity and rewarding inventors     watt s monopoly may have prevented other inventors  such as richard trevithick  william murdoch or jonathan hornblower  from introducing improved steam engines  thereby retarding the industrial revolution by about    years           one question of active interest to historians is why the industrial revolution occurred in europe and not in other parts of the world in the   th century  particularly china  india  and the middle east  or at other times like in classical antiquity    or the middle ages     numerous factors have been suggested  including education  technological changes     see scientific revolution in europe    modern  government   modern  work attitudes  ecology  and culture     however  most historians contest the assertion that europe and china were roughly equal because modern estimates of per capita income on western europe in the late   th century are of roughly       dollars in purchasing power parity  and britain had a per capita income of nearly       dollars     whereas china  by comparison  had only     dollars     some historians such as david landes and max weber credit the different belief systems in asia and europe with dictating where the revolution occurred     the religion and beliefs of europe were largely products of judaeo christianity and greek thought  conversely  chinese society was founded on men like confucius  mencius  han feizi  legalism   lao tzu  taoism   and buddha  buddhism   resulting in very different worldviews     other factors include the considerable distance of china s coal deposits  though large  from its cities as well as the then unnavigable yellow river that connects these deposits to the sea        regarding india  the marxist historian rajani palme dutt said   the capital to finance the industrial revolution in india instead went into financing the industrial revolution in britain      in contrast to china  india was split up into many competing kingdoms  with the three major ones being the marathas  sikhs and the mughals  in addition  the economy was highly dependent on two sectors agriculture of subsistence and cotton  and there appears to have been little technical innovation  it is believed that the vast amounts of wealth were largely stored away in palace treasuries by totalitarian monarchs prior to the british take over     great britain provided the legal and cultural foundations that enabled entrepreneurs to pioneer the industrial revolution     key factors fostering this environment were      the period of peace and stability which followed the unification of england and scotland      no trade barriers between england and scotland      the rule of law  respecting the sanctity of contracts       a straightforward legal system which allowed the formation of joint stock companies  corporations   and     a free market  capitalism            geographical and natural resource advantages of great britain were the fact that it had extensive coast lines and many navigable rivers in an age where water was the easiest means of transportation and having the highest quality coal in europe       there were two main values that really drove the industrial revolution in britain  these values were self interest and an entrepreneurial spirit  because of these interests  many industrial advances were made that resulted in a huge increase in personal wealth  these advancements also greatly benefitted the british society as a whole  countries around the world started to recognise the changes and advancements in britain and use them as an example to begin their own industrial revolutions        the debate about the start of the industrial revolution also concerns the massive lead that great britain had over other countries  some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the british slave trade between africa and the caribbean helped fuel industrial investment  however  it has been pointed out that slave trade and west indian plantations provided only    of the british national income during the years of the industrial revolution     even though slavery accounted for so little  caribbean based demand accounted for     of britain s industrial output        instead  the greater liberalisation of trade from a large merchant base may have allowed britain to produce and use emerging scientific and technological developments more effectively than countries with stronger monarchies  particularly china and russia  britain emerged from the napoleonic wars as the only european nation not ravaged by financial plunder and economic collapse  and having the only merchant fleet of any useful size  european merchant fleets were destroyed during the war by the royal navy      britain s extensive exporting cottage industries also ensured markets were already available for many early forms of manufactured goods  the conflict resulted in most british warfare being conducted overseas  reducing the devastating effects of territorial conquest that affected much of europe  this was further aided by britain s geographical position an island separated from the rest of mainland europe     another theory is that britain was able to succeed in the industrial revolution due to the availability of key resources it possessed  it had a dense population for its small geographical size  enclosure of common land and the related agricultural revolution made a supply of this labour readily available  there was also a local coincidence of natural resources in the north of england  the english midlands  south wales and the scottish lowlands  local supplies of coal  iron  lead  copper  tin  limestone and water power  resulted in excellent conditions for the development and expansion of industry  also  the damp  mild weather conditions of the north west of england provided ideal conditions for the spinning of cotton  providing a natural starting point for the birth of the textiles industry     the stable political situation in britain from around       and british society s greater receptiveness to change  compared with other european countries  can also be said to be factors favouring the industrial revolution  peasant resistance to industrialisation was largely eliminated by the enclosure movement  and the landed upper classes developed commercial interests that made them pioneers in removing obstacles to the growth of capitalism      this point is also made in hilaire belloc s the servile state      britain s population grew                 while the rest of western europe grew             of european urbanisation happened in britain            by       only the netherlands was more urbanised than britain  this was only possible because coal  coke  imported cotton  brick and slate had replaced wood  charcoal  flax  peat and thatch  the latter compete with land grown to feed people while mined materials do not  yet more land would be freed when chemical fertilisers replaced manure and horse s work was mechanised  a workhorse needs   to   acres       to     xa ha  for fodder while even early steam engines produced   times more mechanical energy     in           of coal mined worldwide was in britain  while the netherlands had none  so despite having europe s best transport  most urbanised  well paid  literate people and lowest taxes  it failed to industrialise  in the   th century  it was the only european country whose cities and population shrank  without coal  britain would have run out of suitable river sites for mills by the     s        knowledge of innovation was spread by several means  workers who were trained in the technique might move to another employer or might be poached  a common method was for someone to make a study tour  gathering information where he could  during the whole of the industrial revolution and for the century before  all european countries and america engaged in study touring  some nations  like sweden and france  even trained civil servants or technicians to undertake it as a matter of state policy  in other countries  notably britain and america  this practice was carried out by individual manufacturers eager to improve their own methods  study tours were common then  as now  as was the keeping of travel diaries  records made by industrialists and technicians of the period are an incomparable source of information about their methods     another means for the spread of innovation was by the network of informal philosophical societies  like the lunar society of birmingham  in which members met to discuss  natural philosophy   i e  science  and often its application to manufacturing  the lunar society flourished from      to       and it has been said of them   they were  if you like  the revolutionary committee of that most far reaching of all the eighteenth century revolutions  the industrial revolution      other such societies published volumes of proceedings and transactions  for example  the london based royal society of arts published an illustrated volume of new inventions  as well as papers about them in its annual transactions     there were publications describing technology  encyclopaedias such as harris s lexicon technicum        and abraham rees s cyclopaedia             contain much of value  cyclopaedia contains an enormous amount of information about the science and technology of the first half of the industrial revolution  very well illustrated by fine engravings  foreign printed sources such as the descriptions des arts et m tiers and diderot s encyclop die explained foreign methods with fine engraved plates     periodical publications about manufacturing and technology began to appear in the last decade of the   th century  and many regularly included notice of the latest patents  foreign periodicals  such as the annales des mines  published accounts of travels made by french engineers who observed british methods on study tours     another theory is that the british advance was due to the presence of an entrepreneurial class which believed in progress  technology and hard work     the existence of this class is often linked to the protestant work ethic  see max weber  and the particular status of the baptists and the dissenting protestant sects  such as the quakers and presbyterians that had flourished with the english civil war  reinforcement of confidence in the rule of law  which followed establishment of the prototype of constitutional monarchy in britain in the glorious revolution of       and the emergence of a stable financial market there based on the management of the national debt by the bank of england  contributed to the capacity for  and interest in  private financial investment in industrial ventures     dissenters found themselves barred or discouraged from almost all public offices  as well as education at england s only two universities at the time  although dissenters were still free to study at scotland s four universities   when the restoration of the monarchy took place and membership in the official anglican church became mandatory due to the test act  they thereupon became active in banking  manufacturing and education  the unitarians  in particular  were very involved in education  by running dissenting academies  where  in contrast to the universities of oxford and cambridge and schools such as eton and harrow  much attention was given to mathematics and the sciences areas of scholarship vital to the development of manufacturing technologies     historians sometimes consider this social factor to be extremely important  along with the nature of the national economies involved  while members of these sects were excluded from certain circles of the government  they were considered fellow protestants  to a limited extent  by many in the middle class  such as traditional financiers or other businessmen  given this relative tolerance and the supply of capital  the natural outlet for the more enterprising members of these sects would be to seek new opportunities in the technologies created in the wake of the scientific revolution of the   th century
