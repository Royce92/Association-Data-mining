 linux  pronounced i  l n ks  lin uks   or  less frequently    la n ks  lyn uks    is a unix like and mostly posix compliant  computer operating system assembled under the model of free and open source software development and distribution  the defining component of linux is the linux kernel   an operating system kernel first released on   october      by linus torvalds     the free software foundation uses the name gnu linux to describe the operating system  which has led to some controversy         linux was originally developed as a free operating system for intel x   based personal computers  but has since been ported to more computer hardware platforms than any other operating system citation needed it is the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and supercomputers        but is used on only around      of desktop computers    linux also runs on embedded systems  which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system  this includes mobile phones    tablet computers  network routers  facility automation controls  televisions     and video game consoles  android  the most widely used operating system for tablets and smartphones  is built on top of the linux kernel       the development of linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open source software collaboration  the underlying source code may be used  modified  and distributed commercially or non commercially by anyone under licenses such as the gnu general public license  typically  linux is packaged in a form known as a linux distribution  for both desktop and server use  some popular mainstream linux distributions include debian  ubuntu  linux mint  fedora  opensuse  arch linux  and the commercial red hat enterprise linux and suse linux enterprise server  linux distributions include the linux kernel  supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution s intended use     a distribution oriented toward desktop use will typically include x    wayland or mir as the windowing system  and an accompanying desktop environment such as gnome or the kde software compilation  some such distributions may include a less resource intensive desktop such as lxde or xfce  for use on older or less powerful computers  a distribution intended to run as a server may omit all graphical environments from the standard install  and instead include other software to set up and operate a solution stack such as lamp  because linux is freely redistributable  anyone may create a distribution for any intended use             the unix operating system was conceived and implemented in      at at t s bell laboratories in the united states by ken thompson  dennis ritchie  douglas mcilroy  and joe ossanna    first released in       unix was written entirely in assembly language as it was common practice at the time  later  in a key pioneering approach in       it was re written in the c programming language by dennis ritchie  with exceptions to the kernel and i o   the availability of a high level language implementation of unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier     due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business  at t was required to license the operating system s source code to anyone who asked    as a result  unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses  in       at t divested itself of bell labs  freed of the legal obligation requiring free licensing  bell labs began selling unix as a proprietary product     the gnu project  started in      by richard stallman  had the goal of creating a  complete unix compatible software system  composed entirely of free software  work began in         later  in       stallman started the free software foundation and wrote the gnu general public license  gnu gpl  in       by the early     s  many of the programs required in an operating system  such as libraries  compilers  text editors  a unix shell  and a windowing system  were completed  although low level elements such as device drivers  daemons  and the kernel were stalled and incomplete       linus torvalds has said that if the gnu kernel had been available at the time         he would not have decided to write his own       although not released until      due to legal complications  development of    bsd  from which netbsd  openbsd and freebsd descended  predated that of linux  linus torvalds has said that if    bsd had been available at the time  he probably would not have created linux       minix  initially released in       is an inexpensive minimal unix like operating system  designed for education in computer science  written by andrew s  tanenbaum  starting with version   in       minix became free and was redesigned for use in embedded systems     in       while attending the university of helsinki  torvalds became curious about operating systems   and frustrated by the licensing of minix  which limited it to educational use only  he began to work on his own operating system kernel  which eventually became the linux kernel     torvalds began the development of the linux kernel on minix and applications written for minix were also used on linux  later  linux matured and further linux kernel development took place on linux systems    gnu applications also replaced all minix components  because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the gnu project with the fledgling operating system  code licensed under the gnu gpl can be reused in other projects as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license  torvalds initiated a switch from his original license  which prohibited commercial redistribution  to the gnu gpl    developers worked to integrate gnu components with the linux kernel  making a fully functional and free operating system       linus torvalds had wanted to call his invention freax  a portmanteau of  free    freak   and  x   as an allusion to unix   during the start of his work on the system  he stored the files under the name  freax  for about half of a year  torvalds had already considered the name  linux   but initially dismissed it as too egotistical       in order to facilitate development  the files were uploaded to the ftp server  ftp funet fi  of funet in september       ari lemmke  torvald s coworker at the helsinki university of technology  hut  who was one of the volunteer administrators for the ftp server at the time  did not think that  freax  was a good name  so  he named the project  linux  on the server without consulting torvalds    later  however  torvalds consented to  linux      to demonstrate how the word  linux  should be pronounced  i  l n ks  lin uks     torvalds included an audio guide  xa listenxa  help info   with the kernel source code    another variant of pronunciation is   la n ks  lyn uks       adoption of linux in production environments  rather than being used only by hobbyists  started to take off first in the mid     s in the supercomputing community  where organizations such as nasa started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running linux  commercial use followed when dell and ibm  followed by hewlett packard  started offering linux support to escape microsoft s monopoly in the desktop operating system market       today  linux systems are used in every domain  from embedded systems to supercomputers      and have secured a place in server installations often using the popular lamp application stack    use of linux distributions in home and enterprise desktops has been growing                linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market  with many devices shipping with customized linux distributions installed  and google releasing their own google chrome os designed for netbooks     linux s greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market  with android being one of the most prominent oses among smartphones  tablets and recently wearable technology  linux gaming is also on the rise with valve showing its support for linux and rolling out its own gaming oriented linux distribution  linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and national governments  such as the federal government of brazil       torvalds continues to direct the development of the kernel    stallman heads the free software foundation    which in turn supports the gnu components    finally  individuals and corporations develop third party non gnu components  these third party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries     linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel  gnu components  and non gnu components  with additional package management software in the form of linux distributions     a linux based system is a modular unix like operating system  it derives much of its basic design from principles established in unix during the     s and     s  such a system uses a monolithic kernel  the linux kernel  which handles process control  networking  and peripheral and file system access  device drivers are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while the system is running       separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system s higher level functionality  the gnu userland is an important part of most linux based systems  providing the most common implementation of the c library  a popular cli shell  and many of the common unix tools which carry out many basic operating system tasks  the graphical user interface  or gui  used by most linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the x window system    more recently  the linux community seeks to advance to wayland as the new display server protocol in place of x    ubuntu  however  develops mir instead of wayland       installed components of a linux system include the following         the user interface  also known as the shell  is either a command line interface  cli   a graphical user interface  gui   or through controls attached to the associated hardware  which is common for embedded systems  for desktop systems  the default mode is usually a graphical user interface  although the cli is available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console     cli shells are the text based user interfaces  which use text for both input and output  the dominant shell used in linux is the gnu bourne again shell  bash   originally developed for the gnu project  most low level linux components  including various parts of the userland  use the cli exclusively  the cli is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks  and provides very simple inter process communication     on desktop systems  the most popular user interfaces are the gui shells  packaged together with extensive desktop environments  such as the k desktop environment  kde   gnome  cinnamon  unity  lxde  pantheon and xfce  though a variety of additional user interfaces exist  most popular user interfaces are based on the x window system  often simply called  x   it provides network transparency and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application  however  certain extensions of the x window system are not capable of working over the network    several popular x display servers exist  with the reference implementation  x org server  being the most popular     different window managers variants exist for x    including the tiling  dynamic  stacking and compositing ones  simpler x window managers  such as fvwm  enlightenment  and window maker  provide a minimalist functionality with respect to the desktop environments  a window manager provides a means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows  and interacts with the x window system  the desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations  mutter for gnome  kwin for kde  xfwm for xfce  although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred     wayland is a display server protocol intended as a replacement for the aged x   protocol  as of     update  wayland has not received wider adoption  unlike x    wayland does not need an external window manager and compositing manager  therefore  a wayland compositor takes the role of the display server  window manager and compositing manager  weston is the reference implementation of wayland  while gnome s mutter and kde s kwin are being ported to wayland as standalone display servers instead of merely compositing window managers  enlightenment has already been successfully ported to wayland since version        linux currently has two modern kernel userspace apis for handing video input devices  v l  api for video streams and radio  and dvb api for digital tv reception       due to the complexity and diversity of different devices  and due to the large amount of formats and standards handled by those apis  this infrastructure needs to evolve to better fit other devices  also  a good userspace device library is the key of the success for having userspace applications to be able to work with all formats supported by those devices         the primary difference between linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the linux kernel and other components are free and open source software  linux is not the only such operating system  although it is by far the most widely used    some free and open source software licenses are based on the principle of copyleft  a kind of reciprocity  any work derived from a copyleft piece of software must also be copyleft itself  the most common free software license  the gnu general public license  gpl   is a form of copyleft  and is used for the linux kernel and many of the components from the gnu project     linux based distributions are intended by developers for interoperability with other operating systems and established computing standards  linux systems adhere to posix    sus    lsb  iso  and ansi standards where possible  although to date only one linux distribution has been posix   certified  linux ft         free software projects  although developed through collaboration  are often produced independently of each other  the fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution  however  provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a linux distribution     many linux distributions  or  distros   manage a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection  this allows users to adapt the operating system to their specific needs  distributions are maintained by individuals  loose knit teams  volunteer organizations  and commercial entities  a distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed linux kernel  general system security  and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole  distributions typically use a package manager such as dpkg  synaptic  yast  yum  or portage to install  remove and update all of a system s software from one central location     a distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities  some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis  debian being a well known example  others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions  as red hat does with fedora and suse does with opensuse     in many cities and regions  local associations known as linux user groups  lugs  seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software  they hold meetings and provide free demonstrations  training  technical support  and operating system installation to new users  many internet communities also provide support to linux users and developers  most distributions and free software   open source projects have irc chatrooms or newsgroups  online forums are another means for support  with notable examples being linuxquestions org and the various distribution specific support and community forums  such as ones for ubuntu  fedora  and gentoo  linux distributions host mailing lists  commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list     there are several technology websites with a linux focus  print magazines on linux often include cover disks including software or even complete linux distributions         although linux distributions are generally available without charge  several large corporations sell  support  and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of free software  an analysis of the linux kernel showed    percent of the code from december      to january      was developed by programmers working for corporations  leaving about    percent to volunteers and    unclassified    major corporations that provide contributions include dell  ibm  hp  oracle  sun microsystems  now part of oracle   suse  and nokia  a number of corporations  notably red hat  canonical  and suse  have built a significant business around linux distributions     the free software licenses  on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the linux kernel are based  explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization  the relationship between a linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as symbiotic  one common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support  especially for business users  a number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution  which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks     another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware  this used to be the norm in the computer industry  with operating systems such as cp m  apple dos and versions of mac os prior to     freely copyable  but not modifiable   as computer hardware standardized throughout the     s  it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic  as the os would run on any manufacturer s computer that shared the same architecture     most linux distributions support dozens of programming languages  the original development tools used for building both linux applications and operating system programs are found within the gnu toolchain  which includes the gnu compiler collection  gcc  and the gnu build system  amongst others  gcc provides compilers for ada  c  c    go and fortran  many programming languages have a cross platform reference implementation that supports linux  for example php  perl  ruby  python  java  go  rust and haskell  first released in       the llvm project provides an alternative cross platform open source compiler for many languages  proprietary compilers for linux include the intel c   compiler  sun studio  and ibm xl c c   compiler  basic in the form of visual basic is supported in such forms as gambas  freebasic  and xbasic  and in terms of terminal programming or quickbasic or turbo basic programming in the form of qb       a common feature of unix like systems  linux includes traditional specific purpose programming languages targeted at scripting  text processing and system configuration and management in general  linux distributions support shell scripts  awk  sed and make  many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves  for example  regular expressions are supported in programs like grep  or locate  while advanced text editors  like gnu emacs  have a complete lisp interpreter built in     most distributions also include support for php  perl  ruby  python and other dynamic languages  while not as common  linux also supports c   via mono   vala  and scheme  a number of java virtual machines and development kits run on linux  including the original sun microsystems jvm  hotspot   and ibm s j se re  as well as many open source projects like kaffe and jikesrvm     gnome and kde are popular desktop environments and provide a framework for developing applications  these projects are based on the gtk  and qt widget toolkits  respectively  which can also be used independently of the larger framework  both support a wide variety of languages  there are a number of integrated development environments available including anjuta  code  blocks  codelite  eclipse  geany  activestate komodo  kdevelop  lazarus  monodevelop  netbeans  and qt creator  while the long established editors vim  nano and emacs remain popular       linux kernel is a widely ported operating system kernel  it runs on a highly diverse range of computer architectures  including the hand held arm based ipaq and the ibm mainframes system z  or system z  xa    covering devices ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers    specialized distributions and kernel forks exist for less mainstream architectures  for example  the elks kernel fork can run on intel      or intel          bit microprocessors  while the  clinux kernel fork may run on systems without a memory management unit  the kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer created operating system  such as macintosh computers  with both powerpc and intel processors   pdas  video game consoles  portable music players  and mobile phones     there are several industry associations and hardware conferences devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under linux  such as freedomhec  over time  support for different hardware has improved in linux  resulting in any off the shelf purchase having a  good chance  of being compatible       beside the linux distributions designed for general purpose use on desktops and servers  distributions may be specialized for different purposes including  computer architecture support  embedded systems  stability  security  localization to a specific region or language  targeting of specific user groups  support for real time applications  or commitment to a given desktop environment  furthermore  some distributions deliberately include only free software  as of     update  over four hundred linux distributions are actively developed  with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general purpose use       the popularity of linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years    currently most distributions include a graphical user environment  with the two most popular environments being gnome  which can utilize additional shells such as the default gnome shell and ubuntu unity   and the kde plasma desktop citation needed    no single official linux desktop exists  rather desktop environments and linux distributions select components from a pool of free and open source software with which they construct a gui implementing some more or less strict design guide  gnome  for example  has its human interface guidelines as a design guide  which gives the human machine interface an important role  not just when doing the graphical design  but also when considering people with disabilities  and even when focusing on security       the collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform language localization of some linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost effective  for example the sinhalese language version of the knoppix distribution became available significantly before microsoft translated windows xp into sinhalese citation needed in this case the lanka linux user group played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors  linguists  and local developers     the performance of linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic citation needed for example in      con kolivas accused the linux community of favoring performance on servers  he quit linux kernel development out of frustration with this lack of focus on the desktop  and then gave a  tell all  interview on the topic    since then a significant amount of development has focused on improving the desktop experience  projects such as upstart and systemd aim for a faster boot time  the wayland and mir projects aim at replacing x   while enhancing desktop performance  security and appearance       many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems  for example mozilla firefox  openoffice org libreoffice and blender have downloadable versions for all major operating systems  furthermore  some applications initially developed for linux  such as pidgin  and gimp  were ported to other operating systems  including windows and mac os x  due to their popularity  in addition  a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on linux    such as autodesk maya  softimage xsi and apple shake in the high end field of animation and visual effects  see the list of proprietary software for linux for more details  there are also several companies that have ported their own or other companies  games to linux  with linux also being a supported platform on both the popular steam and desura digital distribution services       many other types of applications available for microsoft windows and mac os x also run on linux  commonly  either a free software application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system  or that application will have a version that works on linux  such as with skype and some video games like dota   and team fortress    furthermore  the wine project provides a windows compatibility layer to run unmodified windows applications on linux  it is sponsored by commercial interests including codeweavers  which produces a commercial version of the software  since       google has also provided funding to the wine project      crossover  a proprietary solution based on the open source wine project  supports running windows versions of microsoft office  intuit applications such as quicken and quickbooks  adobe photoshop versions through cs   and many popular games such as world of warcraft  in other cases  where there is no linux port of some software in areas such as desktop publishing   and professional audio        there is equivalent software available on linux     besides externally visible components  such as x window managers  a non obvious but quite central role is played by the programs hosted by freedesktop org  such as d bus or pulseaudio  both major desktop environments  gnome and kde  include them  each offering graphical front ends written using the corresponding toolkit  gtk  or qt   a display server is another component  which for the longest time has been communicating in the x   display server protocol with its clients  prominent software talking x   includes the x org server and xlib  frustration over the cumbersome x   core protocol  and especially over its numerous extensions  has led to the creation of a new display server protocol  wayland     installing  updating and removing software in linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the synaptic package manager  packagekit  and yum extender  while most major linux distributions have extensive repositories  often containing tens of thousands of packages  not all the software that can run on linux is available from the official repositories  alternatively  users can install packages from unofficial repositories  download pre compiled packages directly from websites  or compile the source code by themselves  all these methods come with different degrees of difficulty  compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new linux users  but it is hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to linux     cinnamon    common desktop environment  cde     enlightenment    gnome shell  gnomexa       kde plasma  kdexa       lxde    mate  gnomexa       pantheon    sugar    trinity  kdexa       unity    xfce    linux distributions have also become popular in the netbook market  with many devices such as the asus eee pc and acer aspire one shipping with customized linux distributions installed       in       google announced its google chrome os  a minimal linux based operating system which application consists only of the google chrome browser  a file manager and a media player    the netbooks that shipped with the operating system  termed chromebooks  started appearing in the market in june            linux distributions have long been used as server operating systems  and have risen to prominence in that area  netcraft reported in september       that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran linux distributions on their web servers    since june       linux distributions represented five of the top ten  freebsd three of ten  and microsoft two of ten    since february       linux distributions represented six of the top ten  freebsd two of ten  and microsoft one of ten       linux distributions are the cornerstone of the lamp server software combination  linux  apache  mariadb mysql  perl php python  which has achieved popularity among developers  and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting       linux distributions have become increasingly popular on mainframes in the last decade partly due to pricing and the open source model   citation needed in december       computer giant ibm reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframe based enterprise linux server       linux distributions are also commonly used as operating systems for supercomputers  in the decade since earth simulator supercomputer  all the fastest supercomputers have used linux  as of november     update      of the world s     fastest supercomputers run some variant of linux    including the top          several oses for smart devices  e g  smartphones  tablet computers  smart tvs  and in vehicle infotainment  ivi  systems  are linux based  the three major platforms are mer  tizen  and android     android has become the dominant mobile operating system for smartphones  during the second quarter of             of smartphones sold worldwide used android    android is also a popular os for tablets  and android smart tvs and in vehicle infotainment systems have also appeared in the market     cell phones and pdas running linux on open source platforms became more common from       examples include the nokia n     openmoko s neo      and the motorola rokr e   continuing the trend  palm  later acquired by hp  produced a new linux derived operating system  webos  which is built into its new line of palm pre smartphones     nokia s maemo  one of the earliest mobile oses  was based on debian    it was later merged with intel s moblin  another linux based os  to form meego    the project was later terminated in favor of tizen  an operating system targeted at mobile devices as well as in vehicle infotainment  ivi   tizen is a project within the linux foundation  several samsung products are already running tizen  samsung gear   being the most significant example    samsung z smartphones will use tizen instead of android       as a result of meego s termination  the mer project forked the meego codebase to create a basis for mobile oriented oses    in july       jolla announced sailfish os  their own mobile os built upon mer technology     mozilla s firefox os consists of the linux kernel  a hardware abstraction layer  a web standards based runtime environment and user interface  and an integrated web browser       canonical has released ubuntu touch  its own mobile os that aims to bring convergence to the user experience on the os and its desktop counterpart  ubuntu  the os also provides a full ubuntu desktop when connected to an external monitor       due to its low cost and ease of customization  linux is often used in embedded systems  in the non mobile telecommunications equipment sector  the majority of customer premises equipment  cpe  hardware runs some linux based operating system  openwrt is a community driven example upon which many of the oem firmwares are based     for example  the popular tivo digital video recorder also uses a customized linux    as do several network firewalls and routers from such makers as cisco linksys  the korg oasys  the korg kronos  the yamaha motif xs motif xf music workstations    yamaha s  xs s  xs  yamaha mox  mox  synthesizers  yamaha motif rack xs tone generator module  and roland rd    gx digital piano also run linux  linux is also used in stage lighting control systems  such as the wholehogiii console        there had been several games that run on traditional desktop linux  and many of which originally written for desktop os  however  due to most game developers not paying attention to such a small market as desktop linux  only a few prominent games have been available for desktop linux  on the other hand  as a popular mobile platform  android has gained much developer interest and there are many games available for android     on    february       valve released a linux version of steam  a popular game distribution platform on pc     many steam games were ported to linux     on    december       valve released steamos  a gaming oriented os based on debian  for beta testing  and has plans to ship steam machines as a gaming and entertainment platform     valve has also developed vogl  an opengl debugger intended to aid video game development     as well as porting its source game engine to desktop linux     as a result of valve s effort  several prominent games such as dota    team fortress    portal  portal   and left   dead   are now natively available on desktop linux     on    july       nvidia released shield as an attempt to use android as a specialized gaming platform        due to the flexibility  customizability and free and open source nature of linux  it becomes possible to highly tune linux for a specific purpose  there are two main methods for creating a specialized linux distribution  building from scratch or from a general purpose distribution as a base  the distributions often used for this purpose include debian  fedora  ubuntu  which is itself based on debian   arch linux  gentoo  and slackware  in contrast  linux distributions built from scratch do not have general purpose bases  instead  they focus on the jeos philosophy by including only necessary components and avoiding resource overhead caused by components considered redundant in the distribution s use cases     a home theater pc  htpc  is a pc that is mainly used as an entertainment system  especially a home theater system  it is normally connected to a television  and often an additional audio system     openelec  a linux distribution that incorporates the media center software kodi  is an os tuned specifically for an htpc  having been built from the ground up adhering to the jeos principle  the os is very lightweight and very suitable for the confined usage range of an htpc     there are also special editions of linux distributions that include the mythtv media center software  such as mythbuntu  a special edition of ubuntu     kali linux is a debian based linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing  it comes preinstalled with several software applications for penetration testing and identifying security exploits        linux live cd sessions have long been used as a tool for recovering data from a broken computer system and for repairing the system  building upon that idea  several linux distributions tailored for this purpose have emerged  most of which use gparted as a partition editor  with additional data recovery and system repair software     spacex uses multiple redundant flight computers in a fault tolerant design in the falcon   rocket  each merlin engine is controlled by three voting computers  with two physical processors per computer that constantly check each other s operation  linux is not inherently fault tolerant  no operating system is  as it is a function of the whole system including the hardware   but the flight computer software makes it so for its purpose     for flexibility  commercial off the shelf parts and system wide  radiation tolerant  design are used instead of radiation hardened parts     as of september     update  spacex has made    launches of the falcon   since       and all    have successfully delivered their primary payloads to earth orbit  including some missions meant for to the international space station     in addition  windows was used as an operating system on non mission critical systems u   blaptops used on board the space station  for example u   bbut it has been replaced with linux  the first linux powered humanoid robot is also undergoing in flight testing        the jet propulsion laboratory has used linux for a number of years  to help with projects relating to the construction of unmanned space flight and deep space exploration   nasa uses linux in robotics in the mars rover  and ubuntu linux to  save data from satellites         linux distributions have been created to provide hands on experience with coding and source code to students  on devices such as the raspberry pi  in addition to producing a practical device  the intention is to show students  how things work under the hood      many quantitative studies of free open source software focus on topics including market share and reliability  with numerous studies specifically examining linux     the linux market is growing rapidly  and the revenue of servers  desktops  and packaged software running linux was expected to exceed       billion by          analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of linux to its security  reliability  low cost  and freedom from vendor lock in           linux kernel is licensed under the gnu general public license  gpl   version    the gpl requires that anyone who distributes software based on source code under this license  must make the originating source code  and any modifications  available to the recipient under the same terms     other key components of a typical linux distribution are also mainly licensed under the gpl  but they may use other licenses  many libraries use the gnu lesser general public license  lgpl   a more permissive variant of the gpl  and the x org implementation of the x window system uses the mit license     torvalds states that the linux kernel will not move from version   of the gpl to version          he specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in digital rights management     it would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders  who number in the thousands        a      study of red hat linux     found that this distribution contained    million source lines of code     using the constructive cost model  the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand man years of development time  according to the study  if all this software had been developed by conventional proprietary means  it would have cost about      xa billion       us dollars  to develop in the united states     most of the source code       was written in the c programming language  but many other languages were used  including c    lisp  assembly language  perl  python  fortran  and various shell scripting languages  slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the gpl  the linux kernel itself was     million lines of code  or    of the total        in a later study  the same analysis was performed for debian version      etch  which was released in           this distribution contained close to     million source lines of code  and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand man years and cost us     xa billion  in      dollars  to develop by conventional means         in the united states  the name linux is a trademark registered to linus torvalds   initially  nobody registered it  but on    august       william r  della croce  jr  filed for the trademark linux  and then demanded royalties from linux distributors  in       torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to torvalds  and  in       the case was settled     the licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the linux mark institute  torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it  lmi originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the linux name as part of trademarks     but later changed this in favor of offering a free  perpetual worldwide sublicense        the free software foundation prefers gnu linux as the name when referring to the operating system as a whole  because it considers linux to be a variant of the gnu operating system  initiated in      by richard stallman  president of the free software foundation         a minority of public figures and software projects other than stallman and the free software foundation  notably debian  which had been sponsored by the free software foundation up to           also use gnu linux when referring to the operating system as a whole          most media and common usage original research  however  refers to this family of operating systems simply as linux  as do many large linux distributions  for example  suse linux and red hat   as of may     update  about    to     of a modern linux distribution is made of gnu components  the range depending on whether gnome is considered part of gnu   as determined by counting lines of source code making up ubuntu s  natty  release  meanwhile  about    is taken by the linux kernel
