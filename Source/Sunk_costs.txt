 in economics and business decision making  a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered  sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with prospective costs  which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken  both retrospective and prospective costs may be either fixed  continuous for as long as the business is in operation and unaffected by output volume  or variable  dependent on volume  costs   however  many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as  fixed  or  variable   for example  if a firm sinks    million on an enterprise software installation  that cost is  sunk  because it was a one time expense and cannot be recovered once spent  a  fixed  cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software  the upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should not be deemed a  fixed  cost  with its cost spread out over time  sunk costs should be kept separate  the  variable costs  for this project might include data centre power usage  etc     in traditional microeconomic theory  only prospective  future  costs are relevant to an investment decision  traditional economics proposes that economic actors should not let sunk costs influence their decisions  doing so would not be rationally assessing a decision exclusively on its own merits  alternatively  a decision maker might make rational decisions according to their own incentives  outside of efficiency or profitability  this is considered to be an incentive problem and is distinct from a sunk cost problem     evidence from behavioral economics suggests this theory fails to predict real world behavior  sunk costs do  in fact  influence actors  decisions because humans are prone to loss aversion and framing effects  in light of such cognitive quirks  it is unsurprising that people frequently fail to behave in ways that economists deem  rational      sunk costs should not affect the rational decision maker s best choice  however  until a decision maker irreversibly commits resources  the prospective cost is an avoidable future cost and is properly included in any decision making processes  for example  if one is considering preordering movie tickets  but has not actually purchased them yet  the cost remains avoidable  if the price of the tickets rises to an amount that requires him to pay more than the value he places on them  he should figure the change in prospective cost into the decision making and re evaluate his decision             the sunk cost is distinct from economic loss  for example  when a new car is purchased  it can subsequently be resold  however  it will probably not be resold for the original purchase price  the economic loss is the difference  including transaction costs   the sum originally paid should not affect any rational future decision making about the car  regardless of the resale value  if the owner can derive more value from selling the car than not selling it  then it should be sold  regardless of the price paid  in this sense  the sunk cost is not a precise quantity  but an economic term for a sum paid  in the past  which is no longer relevant to decisions about the future  it may be used inconsistently in quantitative terms as the original cost or the expected economic loss  it may also be used as shorthand for an error in analysis due to the sunk cost fallacy  irrational decision making or  most simply  as irrelevant data     economists argue that sunk costs are not taken into account when making rational decisions  in the case of a yankees ticket that has already been purchased  the ticket buyer can choose between the following two end results if he realizes that he doesn t like the game     in either case  the ticket buyer has paid the price of the ticket so that part of the decision no longer affects the future  if the ticket buyer regrets buying the ticket  the current decision should be based on whether he wants to see the game at all  regardless of the price  just as if he were to go to a free yankees game  the economist will suggest that  since the second option involves suffering in only one way  spent money   while the first involves suffering in two  spent money plus wasted time   option two is obviously preferable     sunk costs may cause cost overrun  in business  an example of sunk costs may be investment into a factory or research that now has a lower value or no value whatsoever  for example      million has been spent on building a power plant  the value at present is zero because it is incomplete  and no sale or recovery is feasible   the plant can be completed for an additional     million  or abandoned and a different but equally valuable facility built for    million  it should be obvious that abandonment and construction of the alternative facility is the more rational decision  even though it represents a total loss of the original expenditure the original sum invested is a sunk cost  if decision makers are irrational or have the wrong incentives  the completion of the project may be chosen  for example  politicians or managers may have more incentive to avoid the appearance of a total loss  in practice  there is considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in such cases  and decisions may in retrospect appear irrational that were  at the time  reasonable to the economic actors involved and in the context of their own incentives     behavioral economics recognizes that sunk costs often affect economic decisions due to loss aversion  the price paid becomes a benchmark for the value  whereas the price paid should be irrelevant  this is considered irrational behavior  as rationality is defined by classical economics   economic experiments have shown that the sunk cost fallacy and loss aversion are common  hence economic rationality as assumed by much of economics is limited  this has enormous implicationsexample needed for finance  economics  and securities markets in particular  daniel kahneman won the nobel prize in economics in part for his extensive work in this area with his collaborator  amos tversky     two specific features characterizing the sunk cost heuristic worth mentioning are     in      knox and inkster   in what is perhaps the classic sunk cost experiment  approached     horse bettors     of the people had just finished placing a       bet within the past    seconds  and    people were about to place a       bet in the next    seconds  their hypothesis was that people who had just committed themselves to a course of action  betting        would reduce post decision dissonance by believing more strongly than ever that they had picked a winner  knox and inkster asked the bettors to rate their horse s chances of winning on a   point scale  what they found was that people who were about to place a bet rated the chance that their horse would win at an average of      which corresponded to a  fair chance of winning  whereas people who had just finished betting gave an average rating of      which corresponded to a  good chance of winning   their hypothesis was confirmed  after making a       commitment  people became more confident their bet would pay off  knox and inkster performed an ancillary test on the patrons of the horses themselves and managed  after normalization  to repeat their finding almost identically     additional evidence of inflated probability estimations can be found in arkes and blumer         and arkes   hutzel             in a study of    business students in      staw and fox  gave the subjects a choice between making an r d investment either in an underperforming company department  or in other sections of the hypothetical company  staw and fox divided the participants into two groups  a low responsibility condition and a high responsibility condition  in the high responsibility condition  the participants were told that they  as manager  had made an earlier  disappointing r d investment  in the low responsibility condition  subjects were told that a former manager had made a previous r d investment in the underperforming division and were given the same profit data as the other group  in both cases subjects were then asked to make a new     million investment  there was a significant interaction between assumed responsibility and average investment  with the high responsibility condition averaging        million and the low condition averaging       million     similar results have been obtained in earlier studies by staw              and by arkes and blumer         and whyte             many people have strong misgivings about  wasting  resources  loss aversion   in the above example involving a non refundable movie ticket  many people  for example  would feel obliged to go to the movie despite not really wanting to  because doing otherwise would be wasting the ticket price  they feel they ve passed the point of no return  this is sometimes referred to as the sunk cost fallacy  economists would label this behavior  irrational   it is inefficient because it misallocates resources by depending on information that is irrelevant to the decision being made  colloquially  this is known as  throwing good money after bad       this line of thinking  in turn  may reflect a non standard measure of utility  which is ultimately subjective and unique to the consumer  a ticket buyer who purchases a ticket to a bad movie in advance makes a semi public commitment to watching it  to leave early is to make this lapse of judgment manifest to strangers  an appearance he might otherwise choose to avoid  alternatively  he may take pride in having recognized the opportunity cost of the alternative use of time     the idea of sunk costs is often employed when analyzing business decisions  a common example of a sunk cost for a business is the promotion of a brand name  this type of marketing incurs costs that cannot normally be recovered  it is not typically possible to later  demote  one s brand names in exchange for cash  a second example is r d costs  once spent  such costs are sunk and should have no effect on future pricing decisions  so a pharmaceutical company s attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup r d expenses is fallacious  the company will charge market prices whether r d had cost one dollar or one million dollars   however  r d costs  and the ability to recoup those costs  are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on r d     the sunk cost fallacy is in game theory sometimes known as the  concorde fallacy    referring to the fact that the british and french governments continued to fund the joint development of concorde even after it became apparent that there was no longer an economic case for the aircraft  the project was regarded privately by the british government as a  commercial disaster  which should never have been started  and was almost cancelled  but political and legal issues had ultimately made it impossible for either government to pull out     a      article by preston mcafee et al  criticises the view that taking sunk cost into account is irrational or a fallacy  concluding that  once all the elements of the decision making environment are taken into account  reacting to sunk costs can often be understood as rational behavior        the economic approach that sunk costs should not be considered when decisions are being made can lead to a situation where the sum of a number of good decisions can lead to one big disaster  this dilemma situation can be described using a game theory approach for   player games     the sunk cost dilemma with its sequence of good decisions should not be confused with the sunk cost fallacy  where a misconception of sunk costs can lead to bad decisions    sunk cost fallacy occurs when people make decisions about a current situation based on what they have previously invested in the situation  for example  spending      on a concert and on the day you find that it s cold and rainy  you feel that if you don t go you would ve wasted the money and the time you spent in line to get that ticket and feel obligated to follow through even if you don t want to       the bygones principle is an economic theory used in business    economists stress the  extra  or  marginal  costs and benefits of every decision  the theory emphasizes the importance of ignoring past costs and only taking into account the future costs and benefits when making decisions  it states that when making a decision  one should make a hard headed calculation of the extra costs one will incur and weigh these against its extra advantages
