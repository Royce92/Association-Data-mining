 hot swapping and hot plugging are terms used to describe the functions of replacing computer system components without shutting down the system  more specifically  hot swapping describes replacing components without significant interruption to the system  while hot plugging describes the addition of components that would expand the system without significant interruption to the operation of the system   once the appropriate software is installed on the computer  a user can plug and unplug the component without rebooting  a well known example of this functionality is the universal serial bus  usb  that allows users to add or remove peripheral components such as a mouse  keyboard  or printer     computer components are usually described as cold pluggable if the computer system must be powered down to add or remove them  the opposite term is hotpluggable  hotpluggable components can be added or removed without powering down the computer     in most computer systems  cpus and memory are coldpluggable  but it is common for high end servers and mainframes to feature hotplug capability of these components     sometimes  devices that would be hot pluggable may appear to only be cold pluggable because of deficiencies in the system software  for example  ps   pointer devices are generally hot pluggable  although they are not designed to be   but microsoft windows    and related operating systems would commonly have to be rebooted every time a ps   mouse was replaced  in order to detect the new mouse     the terms hot plug and cold plug  can be taken to mean two different things  depending on the context  in a more generic context  hot plug is the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system  while cold plug is the inability to do so  in the context of comparing certain hot pluggable devices  however  hot plug can be taken to mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs  while cold plug can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices without powering down or rebooting the system  but the inability of the system to detect these changes  in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred             hot swapping is used whenever it is desirable to change the configuration or repair a working system without interrupting its operation  it may simply be for convenience of avoiding the delay and nuisance of shutting down and then restarting complex equipment or because it is essential for equipment  such as a server  to be continually active     hot swapping may be used to add or remove peripherals or components  to allow a device to synchronize data with a computer  and to replace faulty modules without interrupting equipment operation     equipment may be designed with redundancy so that in the event of the failure of a component  other parts of the system carry out its functions while the faulty component is removed and a replacement connected  for example  computer raid disk arrays allow a faulty disk to be hot swapped for a new one  the new one is configured to become part of the array automatically or by user command  a machine may have dual power supplies  each adequate to power the machine  a faulty one may be hot swapped     machines that support hot swapping need to be able to modify their operation for the changed configuration  either automatically on detecting the change  or by user intervention  all electrical and mechanical connections associated with hot swapping must be designed so that neither the equipment nor the user can be harmed while hot swapping  other components in the system must be designed so that the removal of a hot swappable component does not interrupt operation     protective covering plates  shields  or bezels may be used on either the removable components or the main device itself to prevent operator contact with live powered circuitry  to provide antistatic protection for components being added or removed  or to prevent the removable components from accidentally touching and shorting out the powered components in the operating device     additional guide slots  pins  notches  or holes may be used to aid in proper insertion of a component between other live components  while mechanical engagement latches  handles  or levers may be used to assist in proper insertion and removal of devices that either require large amounts of force to connect or disconnect  or to assist in the proper mating and holding together of power and communications connectors     there are two slightly differing meanings of the term hot swapping  it may refer only to the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system  while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it  examples include rs     and lower end scsi devices  this is sometimes called cold plugging  however  if the system can detect and respond to addition or removal of hardware  it is referred to as true hot plugging  examples include usb  firewire and higher end scsi devices     some implementations require a component shutdown procedure prior to removal  this simplifies the design  but such devices are not robust in the case of component failure  if a component is removed while it is being used  the operations to that device fail and the user is responsible for retrying if necessary  although this is not usually considered to be a problem     more complex implementations may recommend but do not require that the component be shut down  with sufficient redundancy in the system to allow operation to continue if a component is removed without being shut down  in these systems hot swap is normally used for regular maintenance to the computer  or to replace a broken component     most modern hot swap methods use a specialized connector with staggered pins  so that certain pins are certain to be connected before others  most staggered pin designs have ground pins longer than the others  ensuring that no sensitive circuitry is connected before there is a reliable system ground  the other pins may all be the same length  but in some cases three pin lengths are used so that the incoming device is grounded first  data lines connected second  and power applied third  in rapid succession as the device is inserted  pins of the same nominal length do not necessarily make contact at exactly the same time due to mechanical tolerances  and angling of the connector when inserted     at one time staggered pins were thought to be an expensive solution citation needed but many contemporary connector families now come with staggered pins as standard  for example  they are used on all modern serial scsi disk drives  specialized hot plug power connector pins are now commercially available with repeatable dc current interruption ratings of up to   xa a  printed circuit boards are made with staggered edge fingers for direct hot plugging into a backplane connector     although the speed of plugging cannot be controlled precisely  practical considerations will provide limits that can be used to determine worst case conditions  for a typical staggered pin design where the length difference is    xa mm  the elapsed time between long and short pin contact is between   xa ms and    xa ms  it is quite practical to design hot swap circuits that can operate at that speed     as long as the hot swap connector is sufficiently rigid  one of the four corner pins will always be the first to engage  for a typical two row connector arrangement this provides four first to make corner pins that are usually used for grounds  other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect  for example sensing when the connector is fully seated  this diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center  two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot  the remaining pins are used for all the other data signals     the dc power supplies to a hot swap component are usually pre charged by dedicated long pins that make contact before the main power pins  these pre charge pins are protected by a circuit that limits the inrush current to an acceptable value that cannot damage the pins nor disturb the supply voltage to adjacent slots  the pre charge circuit might be a simple series resistor  a negative temperature coefficient  ntc  resistor  or a current limiter circuit  further protection can be provided by a  soft start  circuit that provides a managed ramp up of the internal dc supply voltages within the component     a typical sequence for a hot swap component being plugged into a slot could be as follows     hot swap power circuits can now be purchased commercially in specially designed asics called hot swap power managers  hspms      modern day radio transmitters  and some tv transmitters as well  use high power rf transistor power modules instead of vacuum tubes  hot swapping power modules is not a new technology  as many of the radio transmitters manufactured in the     s were capable of having power tubes swapped out while the transmitter was running but this feature was not universally adopted due to the introduction of more reliable high power tubes     in the mid     s  several radio transmitter manufactures in the us started offering swappable high power rf transistor modules     the reintroduction of power modules has been good for the radio transmitter industry  as it has fostered innovation  modular transmitters have proven to be more reliable than tube transmitters  when the transmitter is properly chosen for the conditions at the transmitting site     power limitations    companies that produce transmitters using power modules    circuitry attached to signal pins in a hot swap component should include some protection against electrostatic discharge  esd   this usually takes the form of clamp diodes to ground and to the dc power supply voltage  esd effects can be reduced by careful design of the mechanical package around the hot swap component  perhaps by coating it with a thin film of conductive material     particular care must be taken when designing systems with bussed signals which are wired to more than one hot swap component  when a hot swap component is inserted its input and output signal pins will represent a temporary short circuit to ground  this can cause unwanted ground level pulses on the signals which can disturb the operation of other hot swap components in the system  this was a problem for early parallel scsi disk drives  one common design solution is to protect bussed signal pins with series diodes or resistors  cmos buffer devices are now available with specialized inputs and outputs that minimize disturbance of bussed signals during the hot swap operation  if all else fails  another solution is to quiesce the operation of all components during the hot swap operation     although most contemporary video game systems can interchange games and multimedia  e g  blu ray discs  without powering down the system  older generations of systems varied in their support of hot swapping capabilities  for example  where the sony playstation and playstation   could eject a game disc with the system powered on  nintendo game boy advance and the nintendo    would freeze up and could potentially become corrupt if the game cartridge was removed with the power on  manufacturers specifically warned against such practices in the owner s manual or on the game cartridge   it was supposedly the aforementioned reason stop  n  swop was taken out of the banjo kazooie series  with the sega genesis system  it was sometimes possible to apply cheats  such as a player having infinite lives  and other temporary software alterations to games by hot swapping cartridges  even though the cartridges were not designed to be hot swappable      hot swapping can also refer to the ability to alter the running code of a program without needing to interrupt its execution  interactive programming is a programming paradigm that makes extensive use of hot swapping  so the programming activity becomes part of the program flow itself     only a few programming languages support hot swapping natively  including pike  lisp  erlang  smalltalk  visual basic    not vb net   java and most recently elm  and elixir  microsoft visual studio supports a kind of hot swapping called edit and continue  which is supported by c   vb net and c c   when running under a debugger      some web based frameworks  such as django  support detecting module changes and reloading them on the fly  however  although the same as hotswapping for most intents and purposes  this is technically just a cache purge  triggered by a new file  note that this does not apply to markup and programming languages such as html and php respectively  in the general case  as these file are normally re interpreted on each use by default  there are a few cmss and other php based frameworks  such as drupal  that employ caching  however  in these cases  similar abilities and exceptions apply     hot swapping also facilitates developing systems where large amounts of data are being processed  as in entire genomes in bioinformatics algorithms
