 in computing  a file server is a computer attached to a network that has the primary purpose of providing a location for shared disk access  i e  shared storage of computer files  such as documents  sound files  photographs  movies  images  databases  etc   that can be accessed by the workstations that are attached to the same computer network  the term server highlights the role of the machine in the client server scheme  where the clients are the workstations using the storage  a file server is not intended to perform computational tasks  and does not run programs on behalf of its clients  it is designed primarily to enable the storage and retrieval of data while the computation is carried out by the workstations     file servers are commonly found in schools and offices  where users use a lan to connect their client computers             a file server may be dedicated or non dedicated  a dedicated server is designed specifically for use as a file server  with workstations attached for reading and writing files and databases     file servers may also be categorized by the method of access  internet file servers are frequently accessed by file transfer protocol  ftp  or by http  but are different from web servers  that often provide dynamic web content in addition to static files   servers on a lan are usually accessed by smb cifs protocol  windows and unix like  or nfs protocol  unix like systems      database servers  that provide access to a shared database via a database device driver  are not regarded as file servers as they may require record locking     in modern businesses the design of file servers is complicated by competing demands for storage space  access speed  recoverability  ease of administration  security  and budget  this is further complicated by a constantly changing environment  where new hardware and technology rapidly obsolesces old equipment  and yet must seamlessly come online in a fashion compatible with the older machinery  to manage throughput  peak loads  and response time  vendors may utilize queuing theory  to model how the combination of hardware and software will respond over various levels of demand  servers may also employ dynamic load balancing scheme to distribute requests across various pieces of hardware     the primary piece of hardware equipment for servers over the last couple of decades has proven to be the hard disk drive  although other forms of storage are viable  such as magnetic tape and solid state drives  disk drives have continued to offer the best fit for cost  performance  and capacity     since the crucial function of a file server is storage  technology has been developed to operate multiple disk drives together as a team  forming a disk array  a disk array typically has cache  temporary memory storage that is faster than the magnetic disks   as well as advanced functions like raid and storage virtualization  typically disk arrays increase level of availability by using redundant components other than raid  such as power supplies  disk arrays may be consolidated or virtualized in a san     network attached storage  nas  is file level computer data storage connected to a computer network providing data access to heterogeneous clients  nas devices specifically are distinguished from file servers generally in a nas being a computer appliance   a specialized computer built from the ground up for serving files   rather than a general purpose computer being used for serving files  possibly with other functions   in discussions of nass  the term  file server  generally stands for a contrasting term  referring to general purpose computers only     as of     update nas devices are gaining popularity  offering a convenient method for sharing files between multiple computers   potential benefits of network attached storage  compared to non dedicated file servers  include faster data access  easier administration  and simple configuration      nas systems are networked appliances containing one or more hard drives  often arranged into logical  redundant storage containers or raid arrays  network attached storage removes the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network  they typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as nfs  smb cifs  server message block common internet file system   or afp     file servers generally offer some form of system security to limit access to files to specific users or groups  in large organizations  this is a task usually delegated to what is known as directory services such as openldap  novell s edirectory or microsoft s active directory     these servers work within the hierarchical computing environment which treat users  computers  applications and files as distinct but related entities on the network and grant access based on user or group credentials  in many cases  the directory service spans many file servers  potentially hundreds for large organizations  in the past  and in smaller organizations  authentication could take place directly at the server itself
