 a desktop computer is a personal computer in a form intended for regular use at a single location desk table due to its size and power requirements  as opposed to a laptop whose rechargeable battery and compact dimensions allow it to be regularly carried and used in different locations  the most common configuration is a computer monitor  keyboard and mouse  and a case that houses the main components of the pc  namely the power supply  motherboard  hard drive  optical drive  and previously the floppy drive  the form factor of the case is typically an upright tower or  horizontal  desktop  all in one computers  that integrate the monitor and main pc components in one unit  are often categorized under the desktop computer umbrella  particularly if they require an external power source and separate keyboard mouse  the desktop category has also encompassed home computers and workstations             prior to the widespread use of microprocessors  a computer that could fit on a desk was considered remarkably small  the type of computers most commonly used were minicomputers  which were themselves desk sized  early computers took up the space of a whole room  minicomputers generally fit into one or a few refrigerator sized racks     the very first  programmable calculator computer  was marketed in the second half of the     s  starting with the italian machinery programma            computer at typewriter size   more desktop models were introduced in       leading to a model programmable in basic in        this one used a smaller version of a minicomputer design based on read only memory  rom  and had small one line led alphanumeric displays  they could draw computer graphics with a plotter     throughout the     s and     s  desktop computers became the predominant type  the most popular being the ibm pc and its clones  followed by the apple macintosh   with the third placed commodore amiga having some success in the mid     s but declining by the early     s     early personal computers  like the original ibm personal computer  were enclosed in a  desktop case   horizontally oriented to have the display screen placed on top  thus saving space on the user s actual desk  although these cases had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of crt displays that were widespread at the time  over the course of the     s  desktop cases gradually became less common than the more accessible tower cases that may be located on the floor under or beside a desk rather than on a desk  not only these tower cases had more room for expansion  but also they have freed up desk space for monitors which were becoming larger every year  desktop cases  particularly the compact form factors  remain popular for corporate computing environments and kiosks  some computer cases can be interchangeably positioned either horizontally  desktop  or upright  mini tower      influential games such as doom and quake during the     s had pushed gamers and enthusiasts to frequently upgrade to the latest cpu s and graphics cards   dfx  ati  and nvidia  for their desktops  usually a tower case  in order to run these applications  though this has slowed since the late     s as the growing popularity of intel integrated graphics forced game developers to scale back  creative technology s sound blaster series were a de facto standard for sound cards in desktop pc s during the     s until the early     s  when they were reduced to a niche product  as oem desktop pc s came with sound boards integrated directly onto the motherboard     while desktops have long been the most common configuration for pc s    by the mid     s the growth shifted from desktops to laptops   notably  while desktops were mainly produced in the united states  laptops had long been produced by contract manufacturers based in asia  such as foxconn  this shift led to the closure of the many desktop assembly plants in the united states by       another trend around this time was the increasing proportion of inexpensive base configuration desktops being sold  hurting pc manufacturers such as dell whose build to order customization of desktops relied on upselling added features to buyers      battery powered portable computers had just    worldwide market share in        however  laptops have become increasingly popular  both for business and personal use   around     million notebook pcs shipped worldwide in       a growth of     compared to        in      it was estimated that       million notebooks were sold  and that the number would grow in      to       million    the third quarter of      was the first time when worldwide notebook pc shipments exceeded desktops  with      million units versus      million units            the sales breakdown of the apple macintosh have seen sales of desktop macs staying mostly constant while being surpassed by that of mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably  seven out of ten macs sold were laptops in       a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by       the change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop imac moving from affordable  imac g   to upscale  imac g   and subsequent releases are considered premium all in ones  by contrast  the msrp of the macbook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the macbook air and macbook pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a mac  with the exception of the even more inexpensive mac mini  albeit without a monitor and keyboard   not surprisingly the macbooks are the top selling form factors of the macintosh platform today       the decades of development means that most people already own desktop computers that meet their needs and have no need of buying a new one merely to keep pace with advancing technology  notably the successive release of new versions of windows  windows         xp  vista       and so on  had been drivers for the replacement of pcs in the     s  but this slowed down in the     s due to the poor reception of windows vista over windows xp  recently  some analysts have suggested that windows   has actually hurt sales of pcs in       as businesses have decided to stick with windows   rather than upgrade    some suggested that microsoft has acknowledged  implicitly ringing the desktop pc death knell  as windows   offers little upgrade in desktop pc functionality over windows    instead  windows   s innovations are mostly on the mobile side       the post pc trend has seen a decline in the sales of desktop and laptop pcs      the decline has been attributed to increased power and applications of alternative computing devices  namely smartphones and tablet computers    although most people exclusively use their smartphones and tablets for more basic tasks such as social media and casual gaming  these devices have in many instances replaced a second or third pc in the household that would have performed these tasks  though most families still retain a powerful pc  typically a desktop  for serious work       among pc form factors  desktops remain a staple in the enterprise market but have lost popularity among home buyers  pc makers and electronics retailers have responded by investing their engineering and marketing resources towards laptops  initially netbooks in the late     s  and then the higher performance ultrabooks from      onwards   which manufacturers believe have more potential to revive the pc market  than desktops     an all in one desktop computer integrates the system s internal components into the same case as the display  eliminating some connecting cables and allowing for a smaller footprint  sometimes giving a degree of portability  compared to the standard desktop configuration of the separate display monitor and computer system case  however the all in one form factor still requires an external power supply and must be deployed on a table or desk to use the  still separate  keyboard and mouse  making them less mobile than a laptop which can rely on power supplied by a rechargeable battery and provides a built in keyboard plus pointing device for its user     the all in one form factor was popular during the early     s for computers intended for professional use such as the kaypro ii  osborne    trs    model ii and compaq portable  many manufacturers of home computers like commodore and atari included the computer s motherboard into the same enclosure as the keyboard  these systems were most often connected to a television set for display  apple has manufactured several popular examples of all in one computers  such as the original macintosh of the mid     s and the imac of the late     s and     s  by the early     s  many all in one designs were using flat panel displays  and by late      some all in one models also included touchscreen displays to accommodate windows       some all in one desktops such as the imac g  have used laptop components in order to reduce the size of the system case    like laptops  some all in one desktop computers are characterized by an inability to customize or upgrade internal components  as the systems  cases do not provide easy access except through panels which only expose connectors for ram or storage device upgrades  however  newer models of all in one computers have changed their approach to this issue  many of the current manufacturers are using standard off the shelf components and are designing upgrade convenience into their products       desktops have the advantage over laptops  as the spare parts and extensions tend to be standardized  resulting in lower prices and greater availability  for example  the size and mounting of the motherboard is standardized into atx  microatx  btx or other form factors  desktops have several standardized expansion slots  like conventional pci or pci express  while laptops only tend to have one mini pci slot and one pc card slot  or expresscard slot   procedures for assembly and disassembly of desktops tend to be simple and standardized as well  this tends not to be the case for laptops  though adding or replacing some parts  like the optical drive  hard disk  or adding an extra memory module is often quite simple  this means that a desktop computer configuration  usually a tower case  can be customized and upgraded to a greater extent than laptops  this customization has kept tower cases popular among gamers and enthusiasts     another advantage of the desktop is that  apart from environmental concerns  power consumption is not as critical as in laptop computers because the desktop is exclusively powered from the wall socket  desktop computers also provide more space for cooling fans and vents to dissipate heat  allowing enthusiasts to overclock with less risk  the two large microprocessor manufacturers  intel and amd  have developed special cpus for mobile computers  i e  laptops  that consume less power and lower heat  but with lower performance levels     laptop computers  conversely  offer portability that desktop systems  including small form factor and all in one desktops  can not due to their compact size and clamshell design  the laptop s all in one design provides a built in keyboard and a pointing device  such as a trackpad  for its user  and can draw on power supplied by a rechargeable battery     laptops also commonly integrate wireless technologies like wifi  bluetooth and  g  giving them a broader range of options for connecting to the internet  though this trend is changing as more desktop computers come integrated with one or more of these technologies     a desktop computer needs a ups to handle electrical disturbances like short interruptions  blackouts and spikes  achieving an on battery time of more than       minutes for a desktop pc requires a large and expensive ups      a laptop with sufficiently charged battery can continue to be used for hours in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts
