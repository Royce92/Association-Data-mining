 a wide area synchronous grid  also called an  interconnection  in north america  is an electrical grid at a regional scale or greater that operates at a synchronized frequency and is electrically tied together during normal system conditions  these are also known as synchronous zones  the largest of which is the synchronous grid of continental europe  entso e  with    xa gigawatts  gw  of generation  and the widest region served being that of the ips ups system serving countries of the former soviet union  synchronous grids with ample capacity facilitate electricity market trading across wide areas  in the entso e in       over        xa megawatt hours were sold per day on the european energy exchange  eex    as discovered in the california electricity crisis  there are strong incentives among some market traders to deliberately create congestion and poor management of generation capacity on an interconnection network to artificially inflate prices  increasing transmission capacity and expanding the market by uniting with neighboring synchronous networks will make such manipulations more difficult     all of the interconnects in north america are synchronized at   xa hz  while those of europe run at   xa hz  interconnections can be tied to each other via high voltage direct current power transmission lines  dc ties   or with variable frequency transformers  vfts   which permit a controlled flow of energy while also functionally isolating the independent ac frequencies of each side     the benefits of synchronous zones include pooling of generation  resulting in lower generation costs  pooling of load  resulting in significant equalizing effects  common provisioning of reserves  resulting in cheaper primary and secondary reserve power costs  opening of the market  resulting in possibility of long term contracts and short term power exchanges  and mutual assistance in the event of disturbances      the tres amigas superstation aims to enable energy transfers and trading between the eastern interconnection and western interconnection using   gw hvdc connections
