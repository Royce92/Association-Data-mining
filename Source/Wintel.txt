 wintel is a portmanteau of windows and intel  referring to personal computers using intel x   compatible processors running microsoft windows             by the early     s  the chaos and incompatibility that was rife in the early microcomputer market had given way to a smaller number of de facto industry standards  including the s     bus  cp m  the apple ii  microsoft basic in read only memory  r o m    and the  xa     inch floppy drive  no single firm controlled the industry  and fierce competition ensured that innovation in both hardware and software was the rule rather than the exception  microsoft windows and intel processors gained ascendance and their ongoing alliance gave them market dominance      intel claimed that this partnership has enabled the two companies to give customers the benefit of  a seemingly unending spiral of falling prices and rising performance    in addition  they claim a  history of innovation  and  a shared vision of flexible computing for the agile business      in      ibm entered the microcomputer market  the ibm pc was created by a small subdivision of the firm  it was unusual for an ibm product because it was largely sourced from outside component suppliers and was intended to run third party operating systems and software  ibm published the technical specifications and schematics of the pc  which allowed third party companies to produce compatible hardware  the so called open architecture  the ibm pc became one of the most successful computers of all time     the key feature of the ibm pc was that despite its technical mediocritycitation needed and higher than market price citation needed it had ibm s enormous public respect behind it  it was an accident of history that the ibm pc happened to have an intel cpu  instead of the technically superior  motorola       that had been tipped for it  or an ibm in house design   and that it shipped with ibm pc dos  a licensed version of microsoft s ms dos  rather than the cp m    operating system  but these accidents were to have enormous significance in later years     because the ibm pc was an ibm product with the ibm badge  personal computers became respectable  it became easier for a business to justify buying a microcomputer than it had been even a year or two before  and easiest of all to justify buying the ibm personal computer  since the pc architecture was well documented in ibm s manuals  and pc dos was designed to be similar to earlier cp m operating system  the pc soon had thousands of different third party add in cards and software packages available  this made the pc the preferred option for many  since the pc supported the hardware and software they needed     industry competitors took one of several approaches to the changing market  some  such as apple  atari  and acorn  persevered with their independent and quite different systems  of those systems  apple s macintosh is the only one remaining on the market  others  such as digital  then the world s second largest computer company  hewlett packard  and apricot  concentrated on making similar but technically superior models  other early market leaders  such as tandy radio shack or texas instruments  stayed with outdated architectures and proprietary operating systems for some time before belatedly realizing which way market trends were going and switching to the most successful long term business strategy  which was to build a machine that duplicated the ibm pc as closely as possible and sell it for a slightly lower price  or with higher performance  given the very conservative engineering of the early ibm personal computers and their higher than average prices  this was not a terribly difficult task at first  bar only the great technical challenge of crafting a bios that duplicated the function of the ibm bios exactly but did not infringe on copyrights     the two early leaders in this last strategy were both start up companies  columbia computers and compaq  they were the first to achieve reputations for very close compatibility with the ibm machines  which meant that they could run software written for the ibm machine without recompilation  before long  ibm had the best selling personal computer in the world and at least two of the next best sellers were  for practical purposes  identical     for the software industry  the effect was profound  first  it meant that it was rational to write for the ibm pc and its clones as a high priority  and port versions for less common systems at leisure     second  and even more importantly   when a software writer in pre ibm days had to be careful to use as plain a subset of the possible techniques as practicable  so as to be able to run on any hardware that ran cp m   with a major part of the market now all using the same exact hardware  or a very similar clone of it  it was practical to take advantage of any and every hardware specific feature offered by the ibm     independent bios companies like award  chips   technologies  and phoenix began to market a clean room bios that was      compatible with ibm s  and from that time on any competent computer manufacturer could achieve ibm compatibility as a matter of routine     from around       the market was fast growing but relatively stable  there was as yet no sign of the  win  half of  wintel   though microsoft was achieving enormous revenues from dos sales both to ibm and to an ever growing list of other manufacturers who had agreed to buy an ms dos license for every machine they made  even those that shipped with competing products  as for intel  every pc made either had an intel processor or one made by a second source supplier under license from intel  intel and microsoft had enormous revenues  compaq and many other makers between them made far more machines than ibm  but the power to decide the shape of the personal computer rested firmly in ibm s hands     in       ibm introduced the ps   computer line  although the open architecture of the pc and its successors had been a great success for them  and they were the biggest single manufacturer  most of the market was buying faster and cheaper ibm compatible machines made by other firms  the ps  s remained software compatible  but the hardware was quite different  it introduced the technically superior micro channel architecture bus for higher speed communication within the system  but failed to maintain the open at bus  later called the isa bus   which meant that none of the millions of existing add in cards would function  in other words  the new ibm machines were not ibm compatible     further  ibm planned the ps   in such a way that for both technical and legal reasons it would be very difficult to clone  instead  ibm offered to sell a ps   licence to anyone who could afford the royalty  they would not only require a royalty for every ps   compatible machine sold  but also a payment for every ibm compatible machine the particular maker had ever made in the past     many pc manufacturers signed up as ps   licensees   apricot  who had lost badly by persevering with their  better pc than ibm  strategy up until this time  was one of them  but there were many others   many others decided to hold off before committing themselves  some major manufacturers  known as the gang of nine  decided to group together and decide on a bus type that would be open to all manufacturers  as fast as or faster than ibm s microchannel  and yet still retain backward compatibility with isa     this was the crucial turning point  the industry as a whole was no longer content to let ibm make all the major decisions about technical direction  in the event  the new eisa bus was itself a commercial failure beyond the high end  by the time the cost of implementing eisa was reduced to the extent that it would be implemented in most desktop pcs  the much cheaper vesa local bus had removed most of the need for it in desktop pcs  though it remained common in servers due to for example the possibility of data corruption on hard disk drives attached to vlb controllers   and intel s pci bus was just around the corner  but although very few eisa systems were sold  it had achieved its purpose  ibm no longer controlled the computer industry  ibm would belatedly amend the ps   series with the ps valuepoint line  which tracked the features of the emerging ad hoc platform     at around this same time  the end of the     s and the beginning of the     s  microsoft s windows operating environment started to become popular  and microsoft s competitor digital research started to recover a share of the dos press and dos market with dr dos  ibm planned to replace dos with the vastly superior os    originally an ibm microsoft joint venture  and unlike the ps   hardware  highly backward compatible   but microsoft preferred to push the industry in the direction of its own product  windows  with ibm suffering its greatest ever public humiliation in the wake of the ps   disaster  massive financial losses  and a marked lack of company unity or direction  microsoft s combination of a soft marketing voice and a big financial stick was effective  windows became the de facto standard     for the competing computer manufacturers  large or small  the only common factors to provide joint technical leadership were operating software from microsoft  and cpus from intel     over the following years  both firms in the wintel partnership would attempt to extend their monopolies  intel made a successful major push into the motherboard and chipset markets becoming the largest motherboard manufacturer in the world and  at one stage  almost the only chipset manufacturer but badly fumbled its attempt to move into the graphics chip market  and  from       faced sharp competition in its core cpu territory from amd  cyrix  via and transmeta     microsoft fared better  in       microsoft had two competitors in its core market  digital research and ibm   intel had none  by       intel had two competitors in its core market  cpus   while microsoft had none  microsoft had pursued a policy of insisting on per processor royalties  thus making competing operating systems unattractive to computer manufacturers and provoking regulatory scrutiny from the european commission and us authorities  leading to an undertaking by microsoft to cease such practices   however  the integration of dos into windows    was the masterstroke  not only were the other operating system vendors frozen out  microsoft could now require computer manufacturers to comply with its demands on pain of higher prices  as when it required ibm to stop actively marketing os   or else pay more than twice as much for windows    as its competitor compaq citation needed or by withholding  designed for windows     endorsement  which was regarded as an essential hardware marketing tool   microsoft was also able to require that free publicity be given over to them by hardware makers   for example  the windows key advertising symbols on all modern keyboards  or the strict license restrictions on what may or may not be displayed during system boot and on the windows desktop   also  microsoft was able to take over most of the networking market  formerly the domain of lantastic and novell  with windows nt  and the business application market  formerly led by lotus and wordperfect  with microsoft office     although microsoft is by far the dominant player in the wintel partnership now  intel s continuing influence should not be underestimated  intel and microsoft  once the closest of partners  have operated at an uneasy distance from one another since their first major dispute  which had to do with intel s heavy investment in the    bit optimized pentium pro and microsoft s delivery of an unexpectedly high proportion of    bit code in windows     both firms talk with one another s competitors from time to time  most notably with microsoft s close relationship with amd and the development of windows xp professional x   edition utilizing amd designed    bit extensions to the x   architecture  and intel s decision to sell its processors to apple inc     the wintel platform is still the dominant desktop and laptop computer architecture     there have been opinions that microsoft windows by its natural software bloat has eaten up much of the  hardware progress  that intel processors gave to the  wintel platform  via moore s law   after the rise of smartphones and netbooks media have speculated predicting a possible end of wintel dominance with more and more cheap devices employing other technologies        intel is investing in linux  and microsoft has ported windows to the arm architecture with windows       in the strictest sense   wintel  refers only to computers that run windows on an intel processor  however  wintel is now commonly used to refer to a system running a modern microsoft operating system on any modern x   compatible cpu  manufactured by either intel or amd   systems running a microsoft operating system but using an intel microprocessor based on the itanium or arm architecture  however  are not considered to be wintel systems     wintel is also a software product  that allows host operating systems  and applications  such as microsoft windows to run in a protected  virtual environment in a window on mac os x
