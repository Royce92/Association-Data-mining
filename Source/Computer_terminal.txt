 a computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware device that is used for entering data into  and displaying data from  a computer or a computing system  early terminals were inexpensive devices but very slow compared to punched cards or paper tape for input  but as the technology improved and video displays were introduced  terminals pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry  a related development was timesharing systems  which evolved in parallel and made up for any inefficiencies of the user s typing ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine  each at their own terminal     the function of a terminal is confined to display and input of data  a device with significant local programmable data processing capability may be called a  smart terminal  or fat client  a terminal that depends on the host computer for its processing power is called a  dumb terminal  or thin client  a personal computer can run terminal emulator software that replicates the function of a terminal  sometimes allowing concurrent use of local programs and access to a distant terminal host system             the terminal of the first working programmable  fully automatic digital   turing complete  computer  the z   had a keyboard and a row of lamps to show results  dubious   discuss    early user terminals connected to computers were electromechanical teleprinters teletypewriters  teletypewriter  tty   such as the teletype model    asr  originally used for telegraphy or the friden flexowriter  later printing terminals such as the decwriter were developed  however printing terminals were limited by the speed at which paper could be printed  and for interactive use the paper record was unnecessary     by the early     s citation needed manywho  in the computer industry realized that an affordable video data entry terminal could supplant the ubiquitous punched cards and permit new uses for computers that would be more interactive  the problem was that the amount of memory needed to store the information on a page of text was comparable to the memory in low end minicomputers then in use  displaying the information at video speeds was also a challenge and the necessary control logic took up a rack worth of pre integrated circuit electronics  one companywho  announced plans to build a video terminal for         and attracted a large backlog of orders  but folded when their engineering plans  which included fabricating their own ics  proved too ambitiouscitation needed  another approach involved the use of the storage tube  a specialized crt developed by tektronix that retained information written on it without the need to refresh     the datapoint      from computer terminal corporation was announced in      and shipped in       making it one of the earliest stand alone display based terminals  it solved the memory space issue mentioned above by using a digital shift register design  and using only    columns rather than the later more common choice of        early video computer displays were sometimes nicknamed  glass ttys    glass teletypes   or  visual display units   vdus   and used individual logic gates  with no cpu or very primitive lsi chips  yet quickly became extremely popular input output devices on many different types of computer system once several suppliers gravitated to a set of common standards     the great variations in the latter feature gave rise to software that identified and grouped terminal types so the system software would correctly display input forms using the appropriate control codes  in unix like systems the termcap or terminfo files  the stty utility  and the term environment variable would be used  in data general s business basic software  for example  at login time a sequence of codes were sent to the terminal to try to read the cursor s position or the   th line s contents using a sequence of different manufacturer s control code sequences  and the terminal generated response would determine a single digit number  such as   for data general dasher terminals    for adm  a         terminals    or   for tty s with no special features  that would be available to programs to say which set of codes to use     during the late     s and early     s  there were dozens of manufacturers of terminals  including lear siegler  data general  dec  hazeltine corporation  heath zenith  hewlett packard  ibm  televideo  and wyse  many of which had incompatible command sequences  although many used the early adm   as a starting point      an  intelligent  terminal does its own processing  usually implying a microprocessor is built in  but not all terminals with microprocessors did any real processing of input  the main computer to which it was attached would have to respond quickly to each keystroke  the term  intelligent  in this context dates from           from the introduction of the ibm       and the dec vt            the user and programmer could notice significant advantages in vdu technology improvements  yet not all programmers used the features of the new terminals  backward compatibility in the vt    and later televideo terminals  for example  with  dumb terminals  allowed programmers to continue to use older software      some dumb terminals had been able to respond to a few escape sequences without needing microprocessors  they used multiple printed circuit boards with many integrated circuits  the single factor that classed a terminal as  intelligent  was its ability to process user input within the terminal not interrupting the main computer at each keystroke and send a block of data at a time  for example  when the user has finished a whole field or form   most terminals in the early     s  such as adm  a  tvi     data general d   dec vt    despite the introduction of ansi terminals in       were essentially  dumb  terminals  although some of them  such as the later adm and tvi models  did have a primitive block send capability     the advance in microprocessors and lower memory costs made it possible for the terminal to handle editing operations such as inserting characters within a field that may have previously required a full screen full of characters to be re sent from the computer  possibly over a slow modem line  around the mid     s intelligent terminals  costing less that most dumb terminals would have a few years earlier  could provide enough user friendly local editing of data and send the completed form to the main computer  providing even more processing possibilities  workstations like the televideo ts     could run cp m     blurring the distinction between terminal and personal computer     another of the motivations for development of the microprocessor was to simplify and reduce the electronics required in a terminal  that also made it practicable to load several  personalities  into a single terminal  so a qume qvt     could emulate many popular terminals of the day  and so be sold into organizations that did not wish to make any software changes  frequently emulated terminal types included     the ansi x     escape code standard produced uniformity to some extent  but significant differences remained  for example  the vt     heathkit h   in ansi mode  televideo      data general d     and qume qvt     terminals all followed the ansi standard  yet differences might exist of codes from function keys  what character attributes were available  block sending of fields within forms   foreign  character facilities  and handling of printers connected to the back of the screen      most terminals were connected to minicomputers or mainframe computers and often had a green or amber screen  typically terminals communicate with the computer via a serial port via a null modem cable  often using an eia rs     or rs     or rs     or a current loop serial interface  ibm systems communicated over a coaxial cable using ibm s sna protocol  but for many dec  data general and ncr  and so on  computers there were many visual display suppliers competing against the computer manufacturer for terminals to expand the systems  in fact  the instruction design for the intel      was originally conceived at computer terminal corporation as the processor for the datapoint          while early ibm pcs had single color green screens  these screens were not terminals  the screen of a pc did not contain any character generation hardware  all video signals and video formatting were generated by the video display card in the pc  or  in most graphics modes  by the cpu and software  an ibm pc monitor  whether it was the green monochrome display or the    color display  was technically much more similar to an analog tv set  without a tuner  than to a terminal  with suitable software a pc could  however  emulate a terminal  and in that capacity it could be connected to a mainframe or minicomputer  the data general one could be booted into terminal emulator mode from its rom  eventually microprocessor based personal computers greatly reduced the market demand for conventional terminals     in the     s especially   thin clients  and x terminals have combined economical local processing power with central  shared computer facilities to retain some of the advantages of terminals over personal computers     today  most pc telnet clients provide emulation of the most common terminal  the dec vt     using the ansi escape code standard x      or could run as x terminals using software such as cygwin x under microsoft windows or x org server software under linux     since the advent and subsequent popularization of the personal computer  few genuine hardware terminals are used to interface with computers today  using the monitor and keyboard  modern operating systems like linux and the bsd derivatives feature virtual consoles  which are mostly independent from the hardware used     when using a graphical user interface  or gui  like the x window system  one s display is typically occupied by a collection of windows associated with various applications  rather than a single stream of text associated with a single process  in this case  one may use a terminal emulator application within the windowing environment  this arrangement permits terminal like interaction with the computer  for running a command line interpreter  for example  without the need for a physical terminal device  it can even allow the running of multiple terminal emulators on the same device     a text terminal  or often just terminal  sometimes text console  is a serial computer interface for text entry and display  information is presented as an array of pre selected formed characters  when such devices use a video display such as a cathode ray tube  they are called a  video display unit  or  visual display unit   vdu  or  video display terminal   vdt      the system console is a text terminal used to operate a computer  modern computers have a built in keyboard and display for the console  some unix like operating systems such as linux and freebsd have virtual consoles to provide several text terminals on a single computer     the fundamental type of application running on a text terminal is a command line interpreter or shell  which prompts for commands from the user and executes each command after a press of enter  this includes unix shells and some interactive programming environments  in a shell  most of the commands are small applications themselves     another important application type is that of the text editor  a text editor occupies the full area of display  displays one or more text documents  and allows the user to edit the documents  the text editor has  for many uses  been replaced by the word processor  which usually provides rich formatting features that the text editor lacks  the first word processors used text to communicate the structure of the document  but later word processors operate in a graphical environment and provide a wysiwyg simulation of the formatted output     programs such as telix and minicom control a modem and the local terminal to let the user interact with remote servers  on the internet  telnet and ssh work similarly     in the simplest form  a text terminal is like a file  writing to the file displays the text and reading from the file produces what the user enters  in unix like operating systems  there are several character special files that correspond to available text terminals  for other operations  there are special escape sequences  control characters and termios functions that a program can use  most easily via a library such as ncurses  for more complex operations  the programs can use terminal specific ioctl system calls  for an application  the simplest way to use a terminal is to simply write and read text strings to and from it sequentially  the output text is scrolled  so that only the last several lines  typically     are visible  unix systems typically buffer the input text until the enter key is pressed  so the application receives a ready string of text  in this mode  the application need not know much about the terminal  for many interactive applications this is not sufficient  one of the common enhancements is command line editing  assisted with such libraries as readline   it also may give access to command history  this is very helpful for various interactive command line interpreters     even more advanced interactivity is provided with full screen applications  those applications completely control the screen layout  also they respond to key pressing immediately  this mode is very useful for text editors  file managers and web browsers  in addition  such programs control the color and brightness of text on the screen  and decorate it with underline  blinking and special characters  e g  box drawing characters   to achieve all this  the application must deal not only with plain text strings  but also with control characters and escape sequences  which allow to move cursor to an arbitrary position  to clear portions of the screen  change colors and display special characters  and also respond to function keys  the great problem here is that there are so many different terminals and terminal emulators  each with its own set of escape sequences  in order to overcome this  special libraries  such as curses  have been created  together with terminal description databases  such as termcap and terminfo     dumb terminals are those that can interpret a limited number of control codes  cr  lf  etc   but do not have the ability to process special escape sequences that perform functions such as clearing a line  clearing the screen  or controlling cursor position  in this context dumb terminals are sometimes dubbed glass teletypes  for they essentially have the same limited functionality as does a mechanical teletype  this type of dumb terminal is still supported on modern unix like systems by setting the environment variable term to dumb  smart or intelligent terminals are those that also have the ability to process escape sequences  in particular the vt    vt    or ansi escape sequences     a graphical terminal can display images as well as text  graphical terminals are divided into vector mode terminals  and raster mode     a vector mode display directly draws lines on the face of a cathode ray tube under control of the host computer system  the lines are continuously formed  but since the speed of electronics is limited  the number of concurrent lines that can be displayed at one time is limited  vector mode displays were historically important but are no longer used  practically all modern graphic displays are raster mode  descended from the picture scanning techniques used for television  in which the visual elements are a rectangular array of pixels  since the raster image is only perceptible to the human eye as a whole for a very short time  the raster must be refreshed many times per second to give the appearance of a persistent display  the electronic demands of refreshing display memory meant that graphic terminals were developed much later than text terminals  and initially cost much more     most terminals today are graphical  that is  they can show images on the screen  the modern term for graphical terminal is  thin client   a thin client typically uses a protocol like x   for unix terminals  or rdp for microsoft windows  the bandwidth needed depends on the protocol used  the resolution  and the color depth     modern graphic terminals allow display of images in color  and of text in varying sizes  colors  and fonts  type faces      in the early     s an industry consortium attempted to define a standard  alphawindows  that would allow a single crt screen to implement multiple windows  each of which was to behave as a distinct terminal  unfortunately like i o this suffered from being run as a closed standard  non members were unable to obtain even minimal information and there was no realistic way a small company or independent developer could join the consortium  possibly because of this the standard disappeared without trace     a terminal emulator is a piece of software that emulates a text terminal  in the past  before the widespread use of local area networking and broadband internet access  many computers would use a serial access program to communicate with other computers via telephone line or serial device     when the first macintosh was released  a program called macterminal was used to communicate with many computers  including the ibm pc     dec terminal was one of the first terminal programs for the popular altair     the win   console on windows does not emulate a physical terminal that supports escape sequences dubious   discuss so ssh and telnet programs  for logging in textually to remote computers  for windows  including the telnet program bundled with some versions of windows  often incorporate their own code to process escape sequences  the terminal emulators on most unix like systems  such as  for example  xterm and terminal  emulate physical terminals that support escape sequences    terminals can operate in various modes  relating to when they send input typed by the user on the keyboard to the receiving system  whatever that may be      there is a distinction between the return and the   enter keys  in some multiple mode terminals  that can switch between modes  pressing the   enter key when not in block mode does not do the same thing as pressing the return key  whilst the return key will cause an input line to be sent to the host in line at a time mode  the   enter key will rather cause the terminal to transmit the contents of the character row where the cursor is currently positioned to the host  host issued prompts and all      different computer operating systems require different degrees of mode support when terminals are used as computer terminals  the posix terminal interface  as provided by unix and posix compliant operating systems  does not accommodate block mode terminals at all  and only rarely requires the terminal itself to be in line at a time mode  since the operating system is required to provide canonical input mode  where the terminal device driver in the operating system emulates local echo in the terminal  and performs line editing functions at the host end  most usually  and especially so that the host system can support non canonical input mode  terminals for posix compliant systems are always in character at a time mode  in contrast  ibm      terminals connected to mvs systems are always required to be in block mode
