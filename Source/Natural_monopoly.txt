 a natural monopoly is a monopoly in an industry in which it is most efficient  involving the lowest long run average cost  for production to be permanently concentrated in a single firm rather than contested competitively  this market situation gives the largest supplier in an industry  often the first supplier in a market  an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual and potential competitors  so a natural monopoly situation generally leads to an actual monopoly  this tends to be the case in industries where capital costs predominate  creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market  and hence creating high barriers to entry  examples include public utilities such as water services and electricity      while in other situations a monopoly can lead to restricted output  higher than necessary prices  and production that is inefficient  at higher average cost  than would occur with many producers  a firm that is a natural monopoly produces at lower average cost than would be possible with multiple firms  this frees other potential competitors to put their resources to other profitable uses      multiple product industries tend to create a negative externality that could otherwise be avoided if a natural monopoly producer were present  the reasoning is that natural monopolies provide a greater overall benefit to society versus a competitive market citation needed            two different types of cost are important in microeconomics  marginal cost  and fixed cost  the marginal cost is the cost to the company of serving one more customer  in an industry where a natural monopoly does not exist  the vast majority of industries  the marginal cost decreases with economies of scale  then increases as the company has growing pains  overworking its employees  bureaucracy  inefficiencies  etc    along with this  the average cost of its products decreases and increases  a natural monopoly has a very different cost structure  a natural monopoly has a high fixed cost for a product that does not depend on output  but its marginal cost of producing one more good is roughly constant  and small     all industries have costs associated with entering them  often  a large portion of these costs is required for investment  larger industries  like utilities  require enormous initial investment  this barrier to entry reduces the number of possible entrants into the industry regardless of the earning of the corporations within  natural monopolies arise where the largest supplier in an industry  often the first supplier in a market  has an overwhelming cost advantage over other actual or potential competitors  this tends to be the case in industries where fixed costs predominate  creating economies of scale that are large in relation to the size of the market  as is the case in water and electricity services  the fixed cost of constructing a competing transmission network is so high  and the marginal cost of transmission for the incumbent so low  that it effectively bars potential competitors from the monopolist s market  acting as an early insurmountable barrier to entry into the market place     a firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment  this is where economies of scale become important  since each firm has large initial costs  as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost  what they initially invested  is divided among a larger number of customers  therefore  in industries with large initial investment requirements  average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels     companies that take advantage of economies of scale often run into problems of bureaucracy  these factors interact to produce an  ideal  size for a company  at which the company s average cost of production is minimized  if that ideal size is large enough to supply the whole market  then that market is a natural monopoly     once a natural monopoly has been established because of the large initial cost and that  according to the rule of economies of scale  the larger corporation  to a point  has lower average cost and therefore a huge advantage  with this knowledge  no firms attempt to enter the industry and an oligopoly or monopoly develops     william baumol         provided the current formal definition of a natural monopoly where  an industry in which multi firm production is more costly than production by a monopoly   p xa       he linked the definition to the mathematical concept of subadditivity  specifically of the cost function  baumol also noted that for a firm producing a single product  scale economies were a sufficient but not a necessary condition to prove subadditivity     the original concept of natural monopoly is often attributed to john stuart mill  who  writing before the marginalist revolution  believed that prices would reflect the costs of production in absence of an artificial or natural monopoly   in principles of political economy mill criticised smith s neglect  of an area that could explain wage disparity  taking up the examples of professionals such as jewellers  physicians and lawyers  he said      the superiority of reward is not here the consequence of competition  but of its absence  not a compensation for disadvantages inherent in the employment  but an extra advantage  a kind of monopoly price  the effect not of a legal  but of what has been termed a natural monopoly    independently of    artificial monopolies i e  grants by government  there is a natural monopoly in favour of skilled labourers against the unskilled  which makes the difference of reward exceed  sometimes in a manifold proportion  what is sufficient merely to equalize their advantages  if unskilled labourers had it in their power to compete with skilled  by merely taking the trouble of learning the trade  the difference of wages might not exceed what would compensate them for that trouble  at the ordinary rate at which labour is remunerated  but the fact that a course of instruction is required  of even a low degree of costliness  or that the labourer must be maintained for a considerable time from other sources  suffices everywhere to exclude the great body of the labouring people from the possibility of any such competition     so mill s initial use of the term concerned natural abilities  in contrast to the common contemporary usage  which refers solely to market failure in a particular type of industry  such as rail  post or electricity  mill s development of the idea is that what is true of labour is true of capital      all the natural monopolies  meaning thereby those which are created by circumstances  and not by law  which produce or aggravate the disparities in the remuneration of different kinds of labour  operate similarly between different employments of capital  if a business can only be advantageously carried on by a large capital  this in most countries limits so narrowly the class of persons who can enter into the employment  that they are enabled to keep their rate of profit above the general level  a trade may also  from the nature of the case  be confined to so few hands  that profits may admit of being kept up by a combination among the dealers  it is well known that even among so numerous a body as the london booksellers  this sort of combination long continued to exist  i have already mentioned the case of the gas and water companies     mill also applied the term to land  which can manifest a natural monopoly by virtue of it being the only land with a particular mineral  etc   furthermore  mill referred to network industries  such as electricity and water supply  roads  rail and canals  as  practical monopolies   where  it is the part of the government  either to subject the business to reasonable conditions for the general advantage  or to retain such power over it  that the profits of the monopoly may at least be obtained for the public      so  a legal prohibition against competition is often advocated and rates are not left to the market but are regulated by the government     for a discussion of the historical origins of the term  natural monopoly  see mosca       when new technology arrives to a market  there are battles about who is going to control the market  the winner takes control over the market while others fail  new technologies are the natural monopolies of the modern world  making it difficult for start ups to take control of the market       due to the high entry costs and lower maintenance costs  some software development of large and expensive programs like photoshop or windows  can be viewed as a natural monopoly     airlines have high start up costs and are subject to governmental regulation and deregulation  however  because there is no single proprietor and the high continuous operational costs  the airline industry does not qualify as a natural monopoly in the same sense as utilities     utility companies have very high start up costs and must build the power generators as well as provide the grid infrastructure necessary to distribute electricity  if competition were to be allowed in a natural monopoly market  entering firms would have to build new transmission pathways even though the infrastructure is already in place by veteran firms       as with all monopolies  a monopolist who has gained his position through natural monopoly effects may engage in behaviour that abuses his market position  which often leads to calls from consumers for government regulation  government regulation may also come about at the request of a business hoping to enter a market otherwise dominated by a natural monopoly     by instituting a government protected monopoly  the potential for predatory pricing vanishes citation needed    common arguments in favor of regulation include the desire to limit a company s potentially abusive   or unfair market power  facilitate competition  promote investment or system expansion  or stabilize markets  in general  though  regulation occurs when the government believes that the operator  left to his own devices  would behave in a way that is contrary to the public interest    in some countries an early solution to this perceived problem was government provision of  for example  a utility service  however  this approach raised its own problems  some governments used the state provided utility services as a source of cash flow for funding othercitation needed government activities  or as a means of obtaining hard currency  these and other consequences of state provision of services oftencitation needed resulted in inefficiency and poor service quality  as a result citation needed governments began to seek other solutions  namely regulation and providing services on a commercial basis  often through private participation       when corporations bid for the chance to be the monopoly franchise  there is no profit in losing the bid and possibly a very small profit in the lowest bidding  this explains how natural monopolies benefit the greater population with the lowest possible rates  consumer optimality comes from firms making zero profits  which never happens  this means that no one good natural monopolist can achieve sustainable prices indefinitely    when a corporation becomes a natural monopoly under government regulation  it negotiates prices that will be in effect for the length of the contract  this provides the monopolist reasoning to make their prices artificially low to prevent others from entering the marketplace    allowing the monopolist the ability to change prices without regulation can have devastating effects in a society as displayed in bolivia s      cochabamba protests     advocates of laissez faire capitalism generally argue that permanent natural monopolies are merely theoretical  economists from the austrian school argue that governments take ownership of the means of production in certain industries and ban competition under the false pretense that they are natural monopolies
