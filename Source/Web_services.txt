 a web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network  it is a software function provided at a network address over the web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing  the w c defines a web service generally as      a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network      the w c web services architecture working group defined a web services architecture  requiring a specific implementation of a  web service   in this     a web service has an interface described in a machine processable format  specifically wsdl   other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using soap  simple object access protocol  messages  typically conveyed using http with an xml serialization in conjunction with other web related standards      most web services do not adopt this complex architecture citation needed this article describes it in more detail     the w c also states     we can identify two major classes of web services             many organizations use multiple software systems for management  different software systems often need to exchange data with each other  and a web service is a method of communication that allows two software systems to exchange this data over the internet  the software system that requests data is called a service requester  whereas the software system that would process the request and provide the data is called a service provider     different software might be built using different programming languages  and hence there is a need for a method of data exchange that doesn t depend upon a particular programming language  most types of software can  however  interpret xml tags  thus  web services can use xml files for data exchange     rules for communication between different systems need to be defined  such as     all of these rules for communication are defined in a file called wsdl  web services description language   which has the extension  wsdl     a directory called uddi  universal description  discovery and integration  defines which software system should be contacted for which type of data  so when one software system needs one particular report data  it would go to the uddi and find out which other system it can contact for receiving that data  once the software system finds out which other system it should contact  it would then contact that system using a special protocol called soap  simple object access protocol   the service provider system would first of all validate the data request by referring to the wsdl file  and then process the request and send the data under the soap protocol     a web api is a development in web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer  rest  based communications   restful apis do not require xml based web service protocols  soap and wsdl  to support their interfaces     automated tools can aid in the creation of a web service  for services using wsdl  it is possible to either automatically generate wsdl for existing classes  a bottom up model  or to generate a class skeleton given existing wsdl  a top down model      there are a number of web services that use markup languages     critics of non restful web services often complain that they are too complex  and based upon large software vendors or integrators  rather than typical open source implementations     there are also concerns about performance due to web services use of xml as a message format and soap http in enveloping and transporting      functional and non functional web service testing is done with the help of wsdl parsing  regression testing is performed by identifying the changes made thereafter  web service regression testing needs can be categorized in three different ways  namely  changes in wsdl  changes in code  and selective re testing of web service operations  we can capture the above three needs in three intermediate forms of subset wsdl   namely  difference wsdl  dwsdl   unit wsdl  uwsdl   and reduced wsdl  rwsdl   respectively  these three subset wsdls are then combined to form combined wsdl  cwsdl  that is further used for regression testing of the web service  this will help in automated web service change management   by performing the selection of the relevant test cases to construct a reduced test suite from the old test suite        work related to the dealing with the visualization and capturing changes in a web service  visualization and computation of changes can be done in the form of intermediate artifacts  subset wsdl    the insight on computation of change impact is helpful in testing  top down development and reduce regression testing  automated web service change management  awscm   is a pioneer tool that identify subset operations in a wsdl to construct a subset wsdl
